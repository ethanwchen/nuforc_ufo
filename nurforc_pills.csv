My friend and I live in Richmond, Va. and we use to go up to Colonial Beach, which is on the Potomach River and go fishing. The river is a couple of miles wide and on the other side of the river is Maryland. This location is about 10 miles from a militray bas, Fort A.P. Hill. We were fishing behind this seafood restaurant which has a couple of peirs to fish from. On the other peir there was a family of 3. Well, while we were fishing I noticed up in the sky probably 1000 ft. up was a white object flying slowy over the river. It was making no sound. The crazy thing about it was, as it was flying over the river it would just fade out and vanish when it was close to the other side of the river. And amazingly after this would occur, it would re-appear back where it started from. This went on for about 20 minutes. I even ran over to the other pier to show the people there what it was doing. We all saw it in broad daylight on a clear day. The other strange thing was, after it had stopped flying over, a few minutes later a fighter jet flew up through the area that this UFO craft had just been flying in.

It was the summer of '85, we all had finished our season as a tender in Alaska, our ship was a 300' Vessel we were on our way to Seattle, there were four on board me (deleted) my brother (deleted) and our father (deleted) and our chief enginnier.

I think I started cooking on the grill or making sandwitches...I was looking out the porthole I saw the trees....wondering why I can see them so cleary?

The disk seemed to be round but would at times appear flat as well, no larger than a nickel held at arms length, but still under the clouds.

My wife and I were eating our customary lunch on the road after purchasing the food from Maruta, a Japanese grocery in the George town district.  We sat on a curb between Maruta and a Seafirst Bank, next to an on Ramp for I-5 a routine we've gone through several times in the past. One of the attractions ofcourse is the planes landing at King County Airport. After most of the meal I was looking up at the sky watching another plane come in when I noticed a dust spot on a cloud.  I kept watching it to figure out what it was.  Not being able to determine it, I asked my wife what she thought. She insisted it was a bird, but after careful scrutiny, realized it was round and had no movement as a bird might make, such as wings.  Also, at this point we had been watching it a couple of minutes and it was moving in a straight line, no doubts.  No bird can move that straight. We discussed wether or not it was a plane, of which there was one in the sky to compare with and decided no. Aside from the shape, there was absolutely no sound emanating from the object.  A balloon, maybe, but at times it seemed flat and not round, as if it were a CD slowly spinning.  LET ME POINT OUT THAT THIS ANALAGY IS NOT ACCURATE< IT IN NO WAY SEEMED LIKE A SPINNING OBJECT. That merely describes the transition between the round appearance and the flat. While watching, it appeared once my eyes adjusted to the sky's light, that the disk was not black as first appeared but rather a charcoal grey, my wife however maintains that it was black. As it slowly moved towards a cloud, one with shape, not the usual cloudy Seattle sky, I started telling my wife it was a UFO.  She kept saying no, there is some explanation and was remaining very calm. I however was trying to get her to follow the UFO as it was moving by us. She threw away our trash, and started the car, we headed West on Bailey from Maruta's parking lot, the North on Corson Ave, but saw nothing, it was gone. I spent the next fifteen minutes trying to determine the time and direction of the sighting since we had neither a watch or map with us.  I think the information given here is accurate and correct.

They were heading strait for us coming from the northeast and heading southwest. They were moving quite slow, much slower than a small airplane and in a strange synchroniced formation. I would guess them to be between 5 and 10,000 ft. elevation. I continued to watch them for about four minutes while my wife went into the restaurant. They appeared to be flickering as if they were burning. I watched them till they were directly over head. By that time, a few people had past me woundering what I was doing and I told them I was watching some strange lites, they looked up and saw them also. The lites were about 5 times as bright as the north star and from where I stood, looked about 2ft apart.

As one stream of twinkling lights fell to the ground, another stream of lights rose from the ground to the craft

Because the incident happened so long ago, and I was at such a young, I don't remember exactly where the event took place or on what date.  However, as I remember it, I was traveling on a 2-lane highway with my grandpa and older cousin.  While driving towards Elizabethtown KY my grandpa pulled off into a roadside gas station to pick up some snacks.  As he exited the van, I was sitting in the back seat reading a book.  Seconds after he entered the store my cousin who was sitting in the front seat (he was around 13 at the time?) began to yell and point frantically.  I climbed to the front seat to see what he was doing.  He was screaming ""Look, Look!""  As I looked to the horizon across a corn field I saw a rather large object in the sky.  (As soon as I can draw a decent diagram, I will send it in.)  As I looked to the (East?) I saw a round, circular object in the sky that looked white in contrast with the sky.  Around the center of the object was an oblong oval shaped disc.  It looked like a big belt all the way around it.  Within the belt there were approximately four circles of light.  These circles were glowing red, green, and purple, and seemed to be alternating color schemes.  I would estimate that the object was around 200-250 yards away, and was located in the horizon where the corn field, and woods seemed to meet in the distance.  While watching the object, I remember being almost hypnotized by it; I had never seen anyting like it.  In fact at that time, I a positive that I did not know what an alien or a UFO was.  The craft just hovered the where the woods and corn met.  As it hovered it was emitting small twinkling lights down to the ground.  As one line of lights went to the ground, there was a second line of lights that traveled upwards into the craft. The whole time this was happening, my cousin was screaming and yelling.  After about a minute of observation, I snapped out of my fixation and asked him what it was.  He replied ""That's a UFO!  It has some aliens onboard who are probably going to kill off everyone and destroy the earth!""  ""They are going to blow everyhting up!""  Being 7-8 years old, I was pretty impressionable so naturally I believed him. As my grandfather came back to the van with food and drinks, I went to the back seat and cried, all the way to Elizabethtown where we were to visit my great-grandma.  My grandpa asked what was wrong with me but I didn't answer him.  Actually, I did not stop crying until the next morning when I realized that we were not all dead.  As I recall, my cousin and I did not talk to anyone until the next day.  I only bring this up because it really illustrates how absolutely terrified I was with the experience.  I thought for a while that my cousin was just trying to scare me, but he was genuiley terrified also. I am now 22 years old, and about to graduate from college with a degree in Law Enforcement.  To this day I have never seen any object even remotely close to this.  I haven't seen or talked to my cousin, who was present since I was around 10-11.  We had never talked about at all outside of the gas station parking lot.  Actually, I believe he is in prison now.

I was sitting at the corner of M-21 and M-66 facing west at the traffic light getting ready to turn north on M-66.  Looking straight ahead and to the left towards the Michigan Training Unit and Supermax prisons I saw an oval shaped disk hovering in the sky above the trees about 100-125 ft.  I could tell it was metallic because of the sun shining off it. It never moved and with all the traffic I couldn't tell if it made any noise.  I quickly turned onto M-66 going north and went around the corner taking Branch St. and King St. back to M-21.  In just that short of time, it was gone, disappeared.  I kept driving on M-21 past the prisons, past Bertha Brock park, trying to see where it went.  Finally, I gave up and went back home.  I was so shook up and excited it took me awhile to calm down enough to tell my family about it.  They didn't doubt me for a minute.  This isn't the first time I've seen a UFO.  Back in the '80s when my husband and I were dating we saw one on Tuttle Road, looking towards Townsend Rd.  That one was a line of 6 lights hanging suspended in the sky.  Two of the middle lights gradually moved towards each other and then all 6 lights disappeared in a snap.  We weren't the only ones to see that one.

I must admit ever since I was a kid I have always wanted to see a UFO. I just finished reading a book and went to the kitchen to get some food and for some reason I went outside and looked up at the stars and thought I hope I see a UFO and when i looked up again I saw two flashing lights above a mountian across the vally from my house one red and one green naturally at first I thought it was a plane but I couldnt hear it and it wasnt moving so then I thought it could be a planet but I noticed it was swaying and moving unsteadly not smoothly like a plane and I have never seen a plane stay in one place for a long ammount of time before I kept watching for about five more minutes and came to the conclusion that its nothing and it was a plane and I must be soupid to think it was a UFO. So I ran inside and got my brother who was watching tv at the time when he saw it he told me it was a planet until it moved again back and forward very slowley the thought of it being a plane didnt really enter his head because we know what a plane flying through the night sky looks like we watched for about ten more minutes and I was still trying to get my head around what I was seeing. My brother told me to go and get the telescope so I ran to my bedroom and grabbed it I hadent used it in ages so it wasnt assembled as I proceded to assemble the tripod my brother caught it on the telescope and told me it defanitly wasnt a plane or planet he said it looked like a triangle of red,blue,green and white light. It hovered there for about five more minutes and thenvanished just as I got the tripod assembled jez I was pissed. We deciced to stay outside for a second chance of seeing it again and about three minutes later we saw it on the other side of the vally we were so happy to see it again but it was further away this time and moving slowley across the vally we decided to go and wake my mother up. She came out to have a look and said it was a plane and about ten minutes later a plane flew past we all laughed and we could hear it was a plane we then went inside and set the telescope up inside we all stood there watching it for a while and then my mum went to bed my brother and I caught it in the telescope. It was so cool through the telescope it looked like a dome but it had no apparent shape at one stage it looked like a red fireball and then a five cent coin. The colours were clearer through the telescope and were very beautiful it was mostly blue with green,red and white flashes with a hint of orange the colours kept changing as well. It didnt look like it was very steady moving around viontly my brother went to bed at about 1:35am but I stayed up watching it fly so far away that I could hardly see it I fell asleep before it dissapeared. It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.

A single, silent, cigar-shaped craft; white in color; was sighted in a clear sky, about an hour before sunset, by myself and 3 additional pedestrians (2 adults and 1 child). We were all walking near my apartment building which is located close to the intersection of Lincoln Boulevard and Venice Boulevard. I had been reaching up at near arm's length to pet the neighbor's usually docile cat, which was astride the top of the brick wall surrounding their property; and so, I had been looking up when I first noticed the object in the SW sky. (About a minute into the sighting, the cat 'spooked"" and abandoned both his bowl of food and his place on top of the wall.) The UFO continued to travel at a steady rate of speed, from the SW to the NE corners of the sky, until it was finally too far away to be visible to the naked eye. The total observation time was approx. 3 & 1/2 minutes. When the object reached what appeared to be the closest point overhead, it looked like it was about two inches in length, as judged by comparing it to my outstretched hand. Clearly, the object was reflecting the sunlight, as if from a white painted surface.  It did not appear to emit any additional light of its own, however; what looked like a very thin, spherically shaped and almost completely transparent cloud, halo or mist, seemed to cling to the object. This ""mist"" seemed to be fanned by the atmosphere as the object passed overhead. The object was low enough in altitude, (perhaps 3000 to 5000 feet) so that it DEFINITELY was not a likely to have been any type of conventional aircraft.  It looked like a missle, but it's speed was far too slow for that, and the object made no sound whatsoever.  A missle in flight, or a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft this low would have made noise! The object was close enough and the sky was clear enough to recognize  it for exactly what it was - unidentified. - I clearly observed the wings of a similar sized fixed-wing aircraft (commercial jet airliner) which flew overhead about two minutes after the sighting of the UFO began. 	It was plainly evident that the UFO, by comparison, HAD NO WINGS, ROTORS, MISSLE EXHAUST, ETC., of any kind. There was no aerodynamic tapering of the front of the object, such as would be expected to be found on a missle. Both the bow and stern of the object were flat, like a cigar that is cut straight on both ends. 	A man and his little boy approached, about a minute into the sighting.  I pointed the object out to them, and the man immediately exclaimed, ""Hey, that's a UFO!""  A man walking across the street overheard our conversation and looked up also, saying, ""Wow! - what the hell is THAT thing?"" 	The four of us stopped and watched the object for about 2 & 1/2 more minutes, when it seemed to noticeably speed up during the last 30 seconds or so of its remaining, observable flight path, until it had traveled too far into the NE horizon to remain visible to the unaided eye. Up until that point, the object traveled at a slow, steady speed, in a perfectly straight line. 	Afterwards, I called KNXT news radio to inquire if anyone else had reported a sighting of the object. The reporter told me no, but that earlier in the day (at 13:09 HRS, PDT), there had been a missle test launched from Vanderberg AFB. Obviously, this missle test is NOT what WE saw - we observed the UFO around 1900 HRS, PTD; about 6 hours AFTER the Vandenberg launch!","self-employed  (writer & computer instructor)",4,1,"cigar",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2000,2000,3,7,19,"Evening","West",1,0,0,0,0

At approximatly 3:15am on the morning of july 15/00 I was walking on a side street of my home town with some friends. We were returning from getting some food when we stopped to talk to some people at a house party. As we were talking a light caught my attention. I looked up to the South/South West where I saw what appeared to be a light that grew and was glowing a brilliant white. As I continued to watch the light, it travelled in a North/North East direction and began to fade to a cool star blue colour. I continued to watch for the light but it became so faint that I could no longer see it. The speed of the light was relativly quick, I could judge the speed because I could see it passing in front of the stars. I am an airline maintenance technician at Pearson Airport in Toronto. I am used to seeing a/c in the sky. At first I thought it may have been an a/c on approach to Pearson since I was only 100km from the airport. However as the light dimmed I looked for evidence of strobe lights, position lights or navigation lights and there were none present. Also the altitude of the object was very high, not characteristic of an a/c on approach to Pearson. In fact the size of the light and the colour after the brightness dimmed looked just like a star. I would have easily have mistaken it for a star. And finally as an employee of Pearson Airport in Toronto, ON. I know for a fact that the airport has a curfew on aircraft traffic between the times of 12:30am to 06:30am, therefore it is unlikly than an a/c would be approaching Pearson with a landing light on. A/C do not fly with these bright lights on unless they are landing. I am going to try and get in touch with some friends at Air Traffic Control to see if their was traffic in the area at this time. If I find anything else out I will post the information as soon as I receive it.","Aircraft Maintenace Technician",1,1,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2000,2000,3,7,3,"Night",NA,1,0,0,1,0

Exact location from where I had the sighting was in the parking lot of plaza located on the Northwest corner of Reseda and Nordhoff in the city of Northridge CA. about 25 miles North of Hollywood.   There is a grocery store hooked to a chain of other stores in the shape of an L. In the corner of the plaza is a resturaunt called the Hot Wok Cafe.  I was walking through the parking lot towards the Hot Wok cafe which means that I was walking towards the Northwest, just before I got to the resturaunt I looked just above the roofline of the plaza and saw perhaps a few hundred feet above the ground  maybe two or three hundred feet away what looked like a plastic bag being carried around by the wind. The first thing to come to mind was a scene in a movie called American Beauty that focused on a plastic bag dancing in the wind that seemed to have a life of it's own.  I thought it was interesting that a plastic bag could be carried so far in the air even though I could not really tell if it was actually a plastic bag or not, ot only behaved like a plastic bag being spun and carried slightly back and forth in the air.  I was about to dismiss the sight alltogether since I was meeting a friend in the resturaunt and did not want to keep them waiting when I realized that this ""bag"" had pretty much stayed in a very small area.  If it was a bag then the wind that kept the bag in the air also caused it to flutter in float in the same spot for about three minutes.  At this time I couldn't take my eyes off of it, I had to see it either fall or flutter away but it stayed in pretty much the exact spot. After a couple of minutes I decided I need to go into the resturaunt and meet my friend, nothing was happening with the ""bag"" and I only had an hour for lunch.  I went in and looked around and saw that I had been stood up, or my friend had not arrived yet so I ran back into the parking lot and resumed my examination of this object in the sky that was still there in the same spot, fluttering in the exact same manner. Only now there was a small, fuzzy, light colored sspherical object right next to it.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me since I don't have the best eyesight in the world and I have to stare at a computer screen all day.  I looked away and looked back again and the little dot was still there right next to the ""bag"".  I watched for maybe about three or four minutes and noticed that the new object, the ""dot"" was very slowly moving out of sight.  It took about a minute before I couldn't see it anymore.  The ""bag"" remained in the same place.  I watched maybe anothe rminute and decided to inquire in the resturaunt if there had been anyone in there within the past 30 minutes meeting the description of my friend.  The attendant at the front said no so I gave up and decided to get some cheaper food across the parking lot and walked back out.  I looked into the sky again and saw that the object was gone.  I scanned the sky and saw nothing else.  This occured on what I remember to be a clear and hot day.  I would be very interested to read reports from any other witnesses that might have seen something similar in the same area that same day and time.","Production coordinator",1,2,"other",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2000,2000,3,7,12,"Morning","West",1,0,0,0,0

While on a hunting trip, myself and 2 others of a party of 4, a very strange object was observed at a very close range.  

While getting some food for dinner out of the back of my pickup at 9:45 pm, I got a feeling of a thick heavy blanket above me and chills down my spine.   As I turned to look up, the double AA size mini mag flashlight I was using scanned across the corner of a dark triangular object floating directly above us  and our camp trailer.  The object was COMPLETELY SILENT, no noise at all!  I started yelling  HOLY S--T!, HOLY S--T!, HOLY S--T!, YOU GUYS HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS!  I was extremely upset and shaking.  

As I was running (stumbling)  to the trailer my brother and another party member came running out the door.   I did not take my eyes off of this object.  As my light moved across the corner of the triangle, I could see rounded dark edges and the flat bottom.  The bottom had a texture that looked like suede leather and had a gold-grey color to it.  

After the light shined on the object it ""throttled up"" with a very deep low sound of intense power, increasing in intensity slightly and began to float straight up and then move forward(?) up a steep narrow canyon that goes from 6700 ft to 9800 ft.  The object moved up the canyon very slowly like a hockey puck sliding on ice. 

My brother and the other party member had time to look up at the object just as it started to move forward then they both ran to the pickup and grabbed their 10 x 42 Ziess binoculars and continued to watch the object until it was out of sight.  As the object began to move forward the sound stopped and movement continued with complete silence.  This object was only about 200 feet straight  above us when first spotted, about 300 to 400 feet above us when it started to move forward.  

When it ""throttled up,"" three lights, one on each corner of the triangle came on.  Each one of these was about ten feet in diameter and glowed like a dim dome light.  Another ""light"" in the center was about 20 feet in diameter and protuded below the bottom (!) about 8 feet and was deep red in color and pulsed about once a second.  The outline of the object had a slight light halo around it.  None of the lights illuminated anything. 

The shape was a perfect triangle with radius corners and radius edges.  The size was enormous with every detail seemingly in perfect proportion.  Each side of the triangle would be approximately 250 feet long.  The thickness of the body looked to be about 30 feet.  Other dark circles in a symetrical ""design"" were slightly visible.  

The night was clear, lots of stars, no wind.  There was no smell, no feeling of blowing, prop wash or thrust of any sort.  

My bother and I are building contractors and like to think we are normal, educated, business people. The third witness is a successful stone mason contractor.  We all have excellent eyesight.  This was also a ""dry"" camp. 

Although this exceded the limits of our known comprehension we felt priviliged to have witnessed this most incredible piece of equipment.

I zoomed in (320x digital zoom) a few times and what I saw(and recorded) was a yellowish nucleous with some sort of colored energy bands or radiation coming from it,on both the left and right sides there is something shaped half circular and is pitch black and has no color yet the radiant color spills all around the orb except in these spots.I have the tape and I don`t know the first thing about what to do with it.Anyway, get back at me people,I`m flippin my lid trying rationalize this.

I was alone camping in the mountains and was awakened by strange noises and an intense bright light that seemed unearthly.

I am an experienced hiker/backpacker having spent more than 250 days out in the last ten years. On 6/26/93 I was back packing alone in Holy Cross Wilderness area. I had set up camp just at tree line in some scrub brush near a rocky clearing approximately 2 miles due north of Mt Holy Cross.  After securing food and smellables I retired to my tent.  I was awakened to the sound of ""animals?"" scratching the gravel and sand around the tent.  I was not concerned as it sounded like muscrats.. and I quickly fell back asleep. Sometime later I woke abruptly in a cold sweat unable to move or to hear anything (as though underwater).  I was able to open my eyes.  As I did this the sound began to come back but as though through a wall or from far away.  I was scared but thought it a bad dream.  As I lay not knowing what was happening the wind began to pick up and the tent seemed to billow and fall, as though breathing.  The sounds that had been outside previously, had returned and began to intensify.  Instead of one or two small animals though it was as if there were a dozen angrily digging/scratching at the ground all around the tent.  Still unable to move to look from side to side (I was lying on my back) I heard the scratching move from the ground to the tent walls on all sides.  As this happened the wind became more intense causing the tent to sway.  I suppose all of this could be explained by my having a bad dream and a wind storm coming up suddenly.  However, the next part I can not explain.  This whole wind/scratching/tent moving lasted for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Then as though someone had blown out a candle everything stopped and there was complete stillness.  Then the whole tent and surroundings became brighter than daylight.  A complete and encompasing white light entered the tent.  I was absolutely blinding.  I was still unable to move.  I light moved around in some ways but was always intense.  Then as quickly as it became bright it was again dark and as still as any quiet night in the woods.  There wa! s no mor e wind and no more scratching.  As soon as the light was gone I was able to move again.  Needless to say I was upset.  Checking my watch it was almost 03:30:00.  I got up and packed up my things and began my assent of Holy Cross Mtn two hours early.   I did not pass by my campsite on my way out of the preserve.  Rather I took an extended loop and spent the next three nights wondering if it would happen again.  It did not.  I did not see any other hikers during my 5 day outing.  After I left the wilderness area I drove to the nearest town to get some supplies and see if any one had reported any strange sightings.  No one else had seen or reported anything.  I do not do drugs and was not influenced by alcohol during this trip.  I did not see a craft or see any ""little green men""  but I can not explain what happened to me that night.  All I know is that it scared the crap out of me and I am not one to get scared in the woods.","emergency medicine physician",1,2,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"We received a telephoned report of from Australia of a similar event from about the same time.

When reading the Maui Sunday newspaper I came across  a small article about   a large orange fireball in the night sky moving east to west on Saturday night (Jan. 20th). The zetatalk website (which, regardless of who is ""supposed"" to be giving out the information) is a very thorough, and food for thought site to study. According to ""them"" the orange fireballs are part of the precursors to the approach of the so called l2th planet.

I was amazed to see that the time, date and location of one of the sightings listed on your site is almost the same as my sighting. I am a ((senior aviation specialist)) in Ontario, Canada. I and my friend ((name deleted)) were in the air at the time of the Feb. 26th, 1998 sighting above, that was reported near Ontario, NY. We too had a sighting. We had departed from the Oshawa airport and were flying on an eastward heading of about 080 degrees, eventually passing just north of St. Andrews, which is just west of Cornwall Ontario, Canada. ((name deleted)) tapped me on the shoulder, pointed out the window to my right and said,""what's that?"" I saw an object that looked like the underside of a massive metal bowl with multi-coloured lights on it. This thing was much, much, larger than our airplane (a Piper Cherokee 180) and appeared to be tagging along with us at the same altitude (5500-ft.) about 5 nautical miles off of our port side wing. There were several different coloured lights on the object, some of which are not used in aviation at all. They pulsed from left to right slowly, dimmed out, then pulsed from right to left. The color pattern from left to right was: GOLD-RED-BLUE-GREEN-GOLD, then from right to left: GREEN-GOLD-BLUE-RED-GOLD. When the lights were not on, the thing looked semi-transparent. You could see the outline of it, yet it appeared to me that you could see right through it at the same time. I was very excited to see something like this, but at the same time quite upset and afraid because I was unsure of what is was or might do. ((name deleted)) and I were quiet for what seemed like quite a while, just watching this thing, then I decided to call Dorval Terminal in Montreal, Quebec. I said, ""Dorval terminal, this is Cherokee 180""; (I'm holding my callsign until I know what is going to happen with this information). ""Cherokee 180 good evening, Dorval Terminal."". ""We are on a VFR cross-country flight plan, passing just north of the town of St. Andrews on an eastbound heading and have traffic to the south of us at the same altitude. Could you tell us what it is?""  ""Cherokee 180, squawk code (####) on your transponder and standby.""  ""Dorval Terminal, Cherokee (call sign) squawking (####).""  ""Cherokee 180, there in no know traffic at that altitude on our radar within a 60 mile radius of your area.""   I couldn't believe it.  ""Cherokee 180, what kind of aircraft is it?""  ""Dorval Terminal, I don't know. It doesn't look like an aircraft. It's got multi-coloured lights on it that go from left to right and back again and it looks bigger than a 747. It's massive.""  ""Cherokee 180, how long have you been in the air?""  ""Dorval terminal, we've been up here for a few hours.""  Maybe you should land and stretch your legs for awhile, maybe take a break.""  ""Negative Dorval, we'd like to keep going if that's O.K. with you, but you don't know what that is we&#8217;re seeing?&#8221; &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a u.f.o. Cherokee 180! Ha! Ha!&#8221; I was upset and annoyed at the attitude of the controller, because Stan and I both were seeing that thing and the tower was denying it being there. I didn&#8217;t think it was a joke. &#8220;O.K. Cherokee 180, call us again in another 10 minutes&#8221;. &#8220;Roger, Dorval. Cherokee 180 checks remarks&#8221;. I said, &#8220;Stan whatever that thing is out there, it doesn&#8217;t matter right now. We&#8217;ve got to pay attention to our aircraft and flight plan right now, so let&#8217;s do that.&#8221; We resumed our time keeping and navigating. The next time we looked out the window, the object was gone. I asked Stan how he felt about seeing something like that and he said he felt sort of scared. I said, &#8220;me too&#8221;. I contacted Dorval terminal and they gave me a VOR radial (a navigational frequency) to track outbound, away from they&#8217;re airspace. I set up the VOR receiver with the proper radial selected and began trying to track it outbound as requested. The needle twitched from left to right and no matter how hard I tried to hold my heading, no matter what I did, I was unable to keep the needle in the center. I tried the second VOR receiver. Same thing. &#8220;They were working when I tested them a few hours ago!&#8221;, I thought to myself. I knew that Stan had no idea what a VOR was and what was happening, so I tried not to draw his attention to the problem. I looked outside for the object we had seen earlier, but there was nothing there. I had a look at my VNC (VFR Navigational Chart) and set myself a new course for our destination in Quebec. The ceiling started coming down and a call to the local FSS (Flight Service Station) revealed that the weather was below VFR minimums where we were headed. Also, I was amazed to see that the fuel gauges read only ? of a tank on either side! I remembered passing a small airport a short while ago and decided to find it on the map, turn back and land there. I asked FSS if there was fuel available there and they said they&#8217;d have someone waiting for us. We found and identified the airport quite easily, made the appropriate radio calls and landed safely. I had the tanks filled to the rim on both sides before we left Oshawa. I had been running the engine at &#8220;best-lean&#8221;, to conserve fuel and get reasonable power, so I was surprised to see how much fuel had been used. I&#8217;d never noticed this plane to have had such high fuel consumption before. It was as if we&#8217;d been in the air a lot longer than we actually had been. We couldn&#8217;t find anyone to buy fuel from when we arrived at there, so we called FSS and asked them if they had any ideas. They said that we&#8217;d have to go to another nearby airport, about 15 miles away. I was told I&#8217;d get fuel there for sure. Neither of us had enough money for a hotel for the night and cab fare to and from it, so we considered our options. At the time, Quebec had recently experienced an ice storm and was recuperating from downed power-lines, blocked roads and even food shortages in some areas. The temperature was probably between &#8211;15 to &#8211;20 degrees Celsius, so waiting in the plane all night was not an option either; we had to fly. Again I planned the route to our new destination and we took off. Enroute to our new destination I was in constant contact with Dorval Terminal and they gave me some vectors (directions/headings) to help out along the way. The fuel was running out fast and I told Dorval that I didn&#8217;t think I was going to make it. Stan heard this in his headset and must have been terrified, but he said nothing. For some strange reason, I wasn&#8217;t worried. All the events leading up until the end were so surreal. Dorval told me that I should see the airport soon and sure enough, there it was. I had to fight a crosswind like I&#8217;d never experienced before. On final approach, I had such a great deal of crab (wind correction) in that it seemed as if we were flying at almost a 70-degree angle to the runway. As we got closer to the runway, the wind strength died off considerably and I was able to use the rudder to get more in line for our landing. There were fire and foam trucks, the local police and the Chief Pilot of one of the FBO&#8217;s at the airport, waiting for us. We landed normally and taxied in. Along the taxiway, the engine started sputtering and when I went to do my shutdown checklist, the engine quit before I had a chance to pull out the mixture control. The firemen walked over to the plane as Stan and I got out. One of them took the fuel cap off and said something in French. Stan told me that he&#8217;d said, &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing in there&#8221;! One of the firemen asked me in english what my name was, and when I told him, everybody including the police and Chief Pilot was roaring with laughter. I imagine the reason for that is that my last name is almost the same to the letter as a pilot who flew across the Atlantic in a single engine plane without knowing if he&#8217;d make it or not. We got our fuel, had a bite to eat, I got the Chief Pilot to stamp my logbook and we set out to return to Oshawa. The trip back was uneventful and we landed with&#8230;..plenty of fuel!??! I&#8217;m not sure what happened that night, or if any of the events were connected, but I know what I saw. I haven&#8217;t stopped thinking about our sighting and certainly have kept it quiet in commercial circles. I&#8217;ve told a few people, but they all think I&#8217;m either making it up, or that I&#8217;ve got something wrong with me. I&#8217;ve given up talking to people who are ignorant. I&#8217;m ready to talk to someone that believes me, but I&#8217;m still afraid of being ridiculed. I&#8217;m not sure what to do, but it seems to be bothering me more than usual lately. Also, for some reason I keep having this vivid picture in my head of turning directly toward this object and flying in that direction. When I get the image of this in my head, I feel sick, distressed and the tears start coming out. I don&#8217;t know why. I&#8217;m starting to get worried about it.

Small, clear, blinking object seen in northern Wyoming

I was going to college in Sheridan, WY and going to my parents house in Buffalo on the weekends to do laundry, get mail, get food, visit, etc.  I arrived at their house at about 10:30 p.m. on a Friday night.  My parents were gone camping and their neighbors to the right were on vacation, across the street were on vacation and the house to the left was empty, so the neighborbood was unusually dark and quiet.  I brought my clothes in the house and some other luggage through the back door, which is seldom used, because I wanted to a have a cigarrette on the back deck.  I brought everything through the back door and sat on the couch and turned the televsion on.  I sat their for a couple of minutes flipping through the channels when I realized that I was going to have a smoke.  I jumped up and quickly walked to back door which has a window beside it that faces the living room I was sitting in.  I opened the door, stepped out onto the deck, turned to my left, and saw something hovering about three feet away from me, apparently looking in the window.  It was a small, clear, long and thin object.  It kind of looked like a beaker with a yellow light in the center that had a steady, rythmic yellow flash and didn't make a sound.  When I saw it and it had seen me, it floated away from the window and a little closer to me.  I wanted to reach out and grab it, but I was a little scared.  Plus it kind of looked like it may be hot or even sharp or anything that could cause sever pain.  I hovered there and kind of checked me out for about 15 to 20 seconds, then slowly flew toward a large pine tree in our neighbors yard.  It looked like it was trying to hide from me behind the tree, but I could still see it's steadily blinking yellowish light through the branches.  Every once in a while it would come out from behind the tree a little ways, see me, then hide back behind the branches.  After a minute or so, it slowly rose into the sky.  It went higher and higher until I lost sight of it what seemed like about a mile up in ! the sky. After I stood and looked closer, I could see a yellow light flashing way the hell up in the sky and I thought it might be an airplane.  After a few seconds, however, it flew across the sky very, very fast, hovered up there for a while, then slowly lowered itself until it was on the other side of the neighbors house, exactly where they had window facing South.  After about 10 seconds, I saw it again hovering just over the neighbors house, then it slowly floated back off into the neighborhood and disappeared.  I went inside shut the windows, locked the doors and didn't leave until the next morning when I went up the mountain to tell my parents what I had seen.","student",1,1,"cylinder",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Date is approximate.

My mom punished me by flopping and then I heard the voice from unknown space in the sky. Everyone was shocked at that time, I looked around and then I saw one object looks like two plates combined together, one up and one down flying from that area. I noticed that the voice that object sounds as Khmer language, and if it is translated in English language, it was like this : ""You have to learn to teach your children, Do not hurt him."". It is also remarkable that the voice of speaking from that object sounds like sound of the alarm signal. Suddenly when everyone looked at around to see source of the voice, that object flying away and disappeared when the bright light covers it. And later at the same place I heard the sound as alarm signal, and about a few months later I heard clearly the voice of laughing and I saw not clearly a few images of the girls through the bamboo tree. and i talked to them that I want food and suddenly a table with a chair appeared in front of me. I sat on it, but when i want to eat that food. That food disappeared and the images of those girls also disappeared. The food was mango, tamarine, salt,....

It was late at night and some of my friends and I were looking at constellations. My wife pointed out to me a ""moving star"". I noticed it and told her it was a satellite and resumed my star-gazing. In a very short time, 1 or 2 minutes, she said it ""changed directions very quickly"". I then started watching the object. The object seemed extremely high in the atmosphere. It would move in one steady direction, then, as if it were tired of doing that, it would take a quick 90 degree turn in another direction. Then one of my friends noticed another object, then another. There were now a total of 3 moving ""stars"". They roamed around a bit going one direction then another. They would also be moving east, then immediately go 180 degrees towards the west. They then seemed to group in a very large triangle after about 10 minutes of our observance. When they finally were in the triangle formation, they would move back and forth very rapidly from east to west in the 180 degree fashion. I am not gullable, nor do I jump to conclusions. This was the FIRST ufo sighting I have ever witnessed. It was very odd and I now have chills reporting this. The only theory I have come up with in the past 3 weeks since the incident is that they were some sort of military craft like a star-wars anti-missile(ICBM) craft.

My family and I had just moved into the country about 6 miles north of Pine City, Minnesota. We loved looking at the stars and northern light at night. Everything is so vivid. I had recently lost my job driving Greyhound bus, sold the house in Minneapois and decided to rough it for a while. We lived a primitave life style growing our own food, a hand pump outside and an outhouse.

One evening when the family had gone to bed, I stepped outdoors to releive myself. I was facing north looking for the northern lights when I sensed movement behind me. There was a cigar shaped object traveling west to east and slightly downward. It dissapeared behind the treeline. I thought it was a falling star at first but then I realized it was moving much too slow and was not brightly lit.

The more I thought about it the more I thought it must have been an UFO. Two days later I went to town and found everybody talking about some woman on a farm that had a UFO in their yard. It wasn't until later in the day that I put 2 & 2 together that I figured this must have been what I had seen also. The event was recorded in the Pine City Press.

I have never reported this to anyone except my family and some freinds. I don't remember the date but I am sure it will be found in the Pine City Press.

My education is in Electrical Engineering and Nutrition Science.  My wife and I were sunbathing close to the Las Vegas strip at about mid day.  I was observing a plane in the sky, holding up my hand to obliterate the glare of the sun, and I noticed a glare in the sky near the sun at high altitude to the south.  I observed it for a minute with the naked eye and said to my wife I think I might actually be seeing a UFO.  My Wife said run and get the Binoculars.  I ran and returned a minute later with 2 pair of high power binoculars.  I was now apparant that the object had moved north closer to us still at a very high altitude, however.  Through the binoculars we could make out the colors and shape of the object.  It was a brilliant, shiny, bright red hemisphere on the bottom surrounded by a bright silver band.  The band was like the outer edge of a traditional flying saucer like you might see in the movies.  We do not know if the sphere continued to the top of the object or not.  We never got a view of it's top side since it never rotated.  It was far above cloud level, so it must have been pretty big for us to see it.  However, I would not be surprised if no one else observed the object as it was very small in the sky at that high altitude and there were many contrails in the sky from planes. The object was slowly traking due north and was soon directly overhead.  It continued north at a slow steady pace and went eventually out of sight.  The Las Vegas strip runs south to north, so coincidently or not the object was tracking directly over the Strip.  My sceptical, scientific mind tried to reason that maybe it was a wierd high tech weather balloon.  But the wind was blowing east and the object's path was perfectly linear from south to north.  I can only conclude that the object was a craft of top secret government or Alien origen.  I wish I had a high power telescope with a camera mounted, but fate did not provide me that option.  I've never observed a UFO before and have been very sceptical about these t! hings, b ut now I really consider it likely that contact has been made  and they would rather play peek-a-boo than come right out with it.","Researcher",2,1,"other",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2002,2000,1,1,12,"Morning","West",1,0,0,0,0

I am a student of Powell County High School, I work at a local fast food restaurant and view my life as better than average. I was with my boyfriend this evening when I noticed the object. I have always had a fascination with ufos... only I didn't beleive and I am not sure I still do. I think the people who ""SEE"" them are quacks... but... I am definately not a quack. We were on our way up a dirt road when I noticed above a hill about 15 miiles out of town, there was a huge HUGE brilliant light source. I thought nothing of it and started to ""Wish upon a star"" for fun when I noticed it move very fast up then across to the right. I got the drivers attention and we pulled the car to an abrupt stop. At first we assumed it was a satellite, but it was too close to the earth... actually in the atmosphere. We watched it for a few minutes and noticed it change position constantly. Not very far, but enough to see a streak of light. It was cigar shaped in theory, but seemed to assume different positions so that it seemed almost elliptical or circular. This object seemed only a few thousand miles above or less. After a while we decided if it was still there the next evening it would have been nothing and relaxed in our seats and watched the clouds by the moon. (The position of the craft was NE of the moons position that evening.) We checked on it a few rapid times in the next minutes... paranoid as he was... but when we looked back at exactly 11:07. It was gone!!! I was unfortunate to have any camera, but i will keep mine attatched to my hip from now on. I know how important fact is to science. (I want to be a meteorologist.) Good luck in any investigation.

I went north filled with curiosity about this object and turned right on some road in a comercial area eventualy the object was directly above. Other cars in the area were all driving slow and gazing on up at the sky.

Shooting from one area to another with great speed. He then became very excited we drove around the area for two hours but failed to see anything else besides that first initial light.

that morning i was driving west bound on I-70 near Lambert International Airport.  when i exit I-70 to get on I-170 north bound, to my left is the airport which had a regular commerical plane landing at this time. right above the airport there was a silver object shaped like a food cover that most hotels use.  this object was ascending once i got fully focus on it.  

this was a clear sunny day with some clouds.  i watched this thing actully disappear into a clear sky.   further up was a commerical plane at a very high altitude with a smoke trail flying southwest across the sky.  

i really don't know what i saw.  but i found it to be strange that 15min after i saw military frighters flying around and landing (which is normal because of Boeing).

I was driving down the 43rd street extension to go food shopping when I saw a very large,dark, egg shaped (eliptical) object with a shiny spot on each side (lights?). It was not moving at all, not high like an airplane, not a helicopter, not microwave dish.  I was trying to make sense of it because it didn't move.  After 30-40 seconds, I rounded a curve with trees which blocked my view and when I passed the curve the object was gone- no where to be seen.

About 45 minutes later my two children started yelling that there was a rainbow.

I looked up into the blue and stared for about 3 sec. and there they were, 4 ufo's flying in formation/parallel, white and disk shaped. There were two in front and two in back . The two in back were a distance from each other. They came to a stop for a second or two and quickly returned to the formation. They were high in the blue sky. Higher than the chemtrail planes. They were not F-16's, Drones or any conventional aircraft I've ever seen. There was no sound or sonic booms. They were cruising from North to South at a slow pace. I grabbed my 8mm video camera to get a shot and lost the sight of them in the blue. I had a good visual for about 8 seconds and the feeling I got was that they had authority to obsurve.

The date and time (mid-1970's) has blurred over the decades but my memory of the event was as clear as a crystal bell. Some of my older friends had an out door party on a dam near a spillway. They left beer cans out which I came back later to clean up.  As I was leaving I looked up to see the beautiful stars - a stillness came over me.  In shock I saw a very large cigar shaped craft glide silently  over head in front of me.  The silence was thunderous if you know what I mean. I could not believe my eyes and my brain was having a hard time trying to process the 1-4 second experience.  The speed was probably 100 miles an hour plus and moving parellel to its length as a plane would. Without good triangulation the exact size and distance of the UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) can only be estimated.  Using my eyes depth of  field I estimate the object to be around the size of a mid to large jet airliner. The shape was an absolutely perfect cylinder with domed ends (cigar). It was  slightly illuminated in the darkness and ~ a third of a mile away (45 degrees angle up). The direction was north-east. I was walking on the dam's path going south. There was no wings or other indications to assume that it was a jet or airplane.  (I had made a hard choice to give up all cigerettes, alcohol or drugs  long before that night  so you can rule out intoxication.)  That is my experience to the best of my ability and I make no claim as to what this event is or what it is not.

I beg the reader to take in but not judge either way several other experiences I have had that are more difficult to describe dealing with experiences at night  after I went to bed.  In the early 1970's (during puberty -and hormones) I do remember going to bed, starting to feel very heavy then the walls in my room would ""breath"" (not scary). Then I would find my self in a series of 3 absolutely hopeless hynogogic experiences.  In one I was tied across railroad tracks with a speeding train an inch from hitting me then I was balancing on a long needle that balanced on top of a radio antenna that was on top of the Empire State Building and the third experience I blocked from memory in the last few years.

(I called the 3 situations ""the tourture"".)  Then still in a groggy state I would walk (sometimes run) out of the house for real and go for 10 minutes.  Coming out of the groggy state I would be outside as far as a third of a mile away from my home in my underwear (much to my extreme embasasment). My mother would sometimes find me yelling-wide eyed as If I was trying to get away from someone.  I would go back inside but it would take an hour to shake off the strangness of the whole thing.  This happened in the exact pattern maybe 20 times, then after a trip to a psycholigist and 6 or so relaxer pills the experiences ended abruptly never to happen again.  Over the decades I have had  ET dreams : one human and one short elder ""gray"". who communicated wordlessly using either an instructional 3d image projected over my minds eye with a force of emotion that shook me to my core.  My common sense tells me that all the experiences are related but I am the first to admit that the dreams and night walks could be due to my own illusions or projections (in essence nothing to do in anyway with the cigar craft my eyes saw.) I also have no negative feelings toward ET's etc. quite the opposite.  I realize that if they are real then there is a whole range of them just like there is a whole range of humans positive and negitive.

I try to keep an open mind and my mouth shut but I continue to hear people I have become friends over the years describe their own Richmond UFO experiences.  They have no intention of reporting their own experiences and I can't blame them.  Their body language and tone displays honesty and openess.  On this issue I also have seen hypnotic eyed -very animated folks go off on cart-wheeling flights of pompas fancy. On another extreme I have seen stiff necked ultra myopic ""scientific"" skeptics roll their eyes in their own pious pomp.   I take both with a grain of salt.  Most people are neither extreme as they are open and are a pleasure to relate to.  I am thankful for this important web site. Thank you for taking time to read my experiences and thoughts.

I came across this website today, and thought it important to report this even though this was an event that occured a fair time in the past.  I was 11 about to turn 12 in August 1987 and was staying at my father's house at West Lake (just outside of Prince George, BC, Canada).  It was a clear day although briskly cool and more like a fall day.  I was standing in front of our large living room window and looking out over the lake (southern part of the lake, looking east).  I noticed a dark almost black cylindical object vertically positioned almost directly over the middle of the lake.  It was perhaps 50-100 meters above the water.  Oddly I did not think much of it when I first saw it, but then I started to look at it with greater attention.  It was fairly small, I would guess that it was maybe, at most, a meter wide and 3 meters high.  At the middle point there appeared to be a band that was rotating, not really a light, but the band was of a lighter color.  The object stayed motionless, just sitting there for approximately a minute.  I called my dad, but he did not come.  While I was still viewing the object it sped away at a great speed to the upper right at almost exactly a 45 degree angle.  The speed at which it left was easily faster than any object I have ever seen in the air prior or since although it was visible as it sped away.  It left behind a 'very' thin black exhaust trail that lingered for at least a minute and disappeared, but never really dissapated.  I can remember that I ran to my dad and told him regarding the object, and he never really reacted to what I stated, more like an approving nod.  The rest of the afternoon I spent outside with binoculars.  We never talked about it much afterwards.  To create a better image of what I saw, it appeared almost like a black lipstick casing with a brighter band in the middle.  The thing it reminded me of the most when thinking about it afterwards was the probe druid in Star Wars.  The object I saw had little detail bit it just sat there above t! he lake, motionless except for that band.  I am 27 now and this small incident in time still remains a bizarre little fact in my life and I thought I would share it.  I am not certain of its origins, but I am certain it was not a figment of my imagination, nor anything else easily explained.  I would qualify it as an unidentified flying object and that is why I am choosing to share this information here.

Here is a link to the Park on the Northern part of the lake, fyi:

I would also like to add something to this information which is likely unrelated, but on the very slight chance it is I will include it.  About a month before this sighting.  I was standing on our dock on the lake fishing.  I had put some water in the bottom of the canoe about 4 or 5 inches deep and any of the fish I caught I put in the canoe (the squaw fish as we called them were intended as cat food).  The canoe was tied at both ends parallel to the dock.  The weight of the water in the canoe was significant and I weighed at least 120 pounds at the time.  I was standing beside the canoe holding my fishing rod and looking across the lake (my line was not out at the time).  The lake was calm that day but I noticed an extremely fast rippling across the water that was coming toward me from the right.  The force of the wind picked the canoe out of the water, slammed it across the dock and into my leg knocking me into the water on the other side of the dock, with my fishing gear in hand.  All of the water and fish in the canoe were released, the canoe rested on top of the dock turned upside down and I was sitting in the water wandering what happened???  I was just in awe of how wind could pick a very heavy canoe out of the water and knock it into me causing me to tumble over into the water.","Financial Advisor",1,1,"cylinder",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1987,1980,3,8,14,"Afternoon",NA,1,0,0,0,0

My daughter and I were traveling from Huntington, on I64 headed east to our house in Putnam,co. we looked up in the sky and we saw an aluminum-sublike ufo(what you call,""cigar-shaped""-maybe). It was moving slowly(extremely)and being in the passing lane,I crossed over to pull off on the burm to watch it. It was just there moving ever so slightly and it just dissapeared. It was very large,silver and although The  LORD has blessed me to see many UFO's I've never seen any that looked like this. Several days later, my daughter and I were at a food drive-thru in putnam,co and we were waiting for our order when she said,mom is that a star? I said,no, that's a ufo.It wasn't until many days later when I was telling a friend about the experience we realized the ufo we were looking at during the drive-thru, were two different ufo's because the one I saw was red and the one she saw was white(these looked like little circles and did not last long-maybe a minute).

I was returning home from Edmonton. I live on an acreage near Stony Plain. A friend and I had spent the day fishing and finished off with some food. I got back to my house around 1:30-2:00 AM.

 Upon getting out of my car I looked at the sky, as I usually do on a clear night. I was admiring how clear the sky was when I noticed a very bright light to the north. My first instinct was that it may be a satellite. I love watching the sky and am quite familiar with the appearance of satellites in orbit, and their linear patterns. This light however was not moving in a straight line and seemed to slow down and speed up randomly. It would pulsate from very bright to almost invisible. The duration of the brightness was much longer than the gradual fade.

 It appeared circular in shape, but had no visible edges. It proceeded south in a straight line, occasionally breaking course to either side. The movement did not seem natural.

 It was also quite close, compared to satellites I have seen in the night sky. No sound was emitted. The whole thing was actually quite surreal, especially since it had covered so much distance in 10-15 seconds. Shortly after it had broke from its straight course south for the 5th or 6th time, it just seemed to vanish.

 I'm not sure what I saw. I do watch the sky constantly, for beauty and curiosity. This event stood out from anything else I have ever seen. Got me pretty excited, and a little nervous.

Keep in mind it's an account written by the biggest paranormal/UFO skeptic going but my partner of 7 years and I DEFINATELY witnessed something unusual on a recent unwind trip in Mexico this past week.  We are both two very sane, sober professional Minnesota guys in our thirties and were hardly in search of anything more exciting than some R and R by the pool when we landed in Cancun this past Monday.  After quickly being shuttled to our resort just south of Cancun we settled in our room and indulged in the food accomadations but skipped the complimentary Tacates because after a 4 hour trip all we wanted was to shower and inspect the fantastic playground and beach.  We were already relaxed and by this time it was dark.  Neither of us were tired though, flying from Minneapolis we had the luxury of being in the same time zone and I can assure you NOTHING clouded our vision that night.  We sat togther on two empty lounge chairs on the beach no more than a few feet from the grounds of the resort and discussed our options for our all inclusive packaged week.  We had never been to Cancun and it was exciting.  Above us was a spectacular sky, there were a few clouds and it was a little windy but altogther quite clear.  My partner had pointed out a few constellations I had never seen before having never been that far south in my life and no later than a few seconds after he started talking about the sky then TWO BRIGHT WHITE STARS from opposite sides of the beach MOVED toward each other.  SHOOTING STAR/S????????????!!!!We were intantly stunned and silent as they slowly moved toward each other, they then sort of stopped and ""kissed"", moved slowly apart then across the sky again, sometimes in perfect unison and at other times at different speeds and zig zag patterns.  I can say that neither of them circled in any way or ever appeared to come close to the ground.  They moved in straight lines, stopped an! d then changed pace and pattern over and over.  We were actually laughing in amazement, scouring the dark beach for other witnesses to this event but the only sound was the faint chatter of the full restaurants in the backround. It was a real ""What the hell is happening"" moment and the more excited and vocal we got in our astonishement the more faster and elaborate the patterns got, almost as if these things knew there was an audience!  It lasted no more than a few minutes, they just lost their brigtness and faded abruptly.  We couldn't take our eyes from the sky but they didn't return that night and we didn't check again on any other night although we talked about it often as we enjoyed the rest of our vacation just freaked that it had occured.  Nothing like that had happened to either of us before in our lives.  It changes you a bit.  We didn't feel threatened by these things, and nobody in the world could ever discount that moment for us although I'm very open for an explanation for this because from our hotel patio during the day I COULD see large, noisy commercial flights taking off in that vacinity from the local airport.  These were not planes and I have seen amusement park/Vegas style light effects in the sky before and I know that these things definately could not be produced in that way.  In fact it was much more than just seeing these thing that we experienced that night, we both had an overwhelming sense of being ""performed"" to as if something was communicating and although it wasn't clear what that was it wasn't beligerent in any way and maybe enhanced our trip altogether.  I was ready to ditch this memory this wind down weekend back home until I searched ""Cancun"" and ""UFO' on the internet out of curiosity and again found my self astounded by a few eerily and almost IDENTICAL experiences to ours in the very same area involving ""dancing stars"".  For this reason I add our account for whatever it may be worth, remaining as true and accurate to it as I can possibly be.

ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION , WAS THE SUDDEN APPEARENCE OF IDENTICAL LIGHT FORM APPROACHING WHERE THE FIRST ONE WAS (AT RIGHT ANGLE)AT HIGH SPEED JUST TO SUDDENLY STOP NEAR IT. BOTH NOW STARTED SYNCHRONIZINGLY VIBRATING AS IF WERE DANCING.

A THIRD IDENTICAL LIGHT (AT RIGHT ANGLE RELATIVE TO THE SECONG)APPEARED TO APPROCH THE FIRST FORMATION.

THE WHOLE FORMATION NOW STARTED TO TURN AROUND ITSELF AT SLOW BUT ACCELERATING SPEED WITH LIGHTS TWINKLING IN HARMONY BUT VIBRATION HAS STOPPED.

 THIS WHOLE SEEN CONTINUED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES. IT THEN DISSINTEGRATED IN THE SAME ORDER AND SEQUENCE AS IT WAS FORMED. THE LIGHTS WERE DISAPEARING AS THEY APPROACHED THEIR START POINT.

 EVERYTHING RETURNED TO NORMAL.



((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE))

Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),

Thank you very much for the excellent report!  Also, I commend you on your ability to compose lucid, eloquent prose in English!!  You write more skillfully, I observe, than most U. S. college students.

Can you be certain that the lights were not being projected by some type of device on the ground?  The motion of the lights, as they rotated, is not > inconsistent with the motion seen in a type of advertising light we have here in the U. S., so I feel duty-bound to pose the question.

We will post your report in the near future.  If your friends, or wife's brother, would like to submit reports about their recollections of the event, we would most welcome them.  Please invite them to use our Online Report Form, if they would like to record the incident in their own words.

Thank you very much for sharing the interesting information with our Center!

Cordially,  Peter Davenport

DEAR MR Davenport

I CALLED THE OBSERVER THIS MORNING AND HAD THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS:

* THE EVENT AREA IS A NON POPULATED SEMI MILITARY- CLOSED ZONE BOARDERING
JORDAN AND ISRAEL. HENCE, ENTRANCE PERMISSIONS ARE ALLOWED BUT TO FEW
TRUSTEES;COMMERCIALS ARE NOT TRANSMITTED TO THE PIGS?!.WE HAVE VISITED THE
AREA MANY MANY TIMES AND THAT WAS THE MOST UNIQUE OCCURING EVENT. WE CAN
EASLY (ME AND ALL MENTIONED VISITORS) DISTINGUISH MILITRY LIGHT PROJECTED AT
ALL ANGLES SCANNING NIGHT SKIES AND SURROUNDING LAND. NOTHING WAS SIMILAR TO
WHAT MY WIFE'S BROTHER HAS SEEN. ALSO, THE LIGHT EMITTED FROM THE ""OBJECTS?""
WAS SO SATURATED AND CONDENSE IMPLYING A SOURCE NATURE AND NOT A REFLECTION OR EXTENSION OF A GROUND PROJECTION. ALSO VIBRATIONS WERE (AS DISCRIBED BY THE OBSERVER) SO TINY  IMPLYING A SOURCE SELF SHAKING; A MINIMAL GROUND MOVEMENT OF A SKY PROJECTED EMISSION MEANS TENS OF KILOMETRES HORIZONTAL MOVEMENT AT THE DISTANTLY OBSERVED FOCUSED LIGHTS. ALSO, LUMINATION WAS STABLE AND CONSTANT WITH NO LIGHT SHADOWS OR LONG BEAMS EMITTING FROM THE GROUND. MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT IT WAS A VERY CALM NIGHT WITH NO REPORTS OF BOARDER PENETRATIONS URGING MILITARY SCANNING OF BOTH SIDES. UNFORTUNATELY, OBSERVERS LACK ENGLISH ABILITY TO EXPRESS ; LET ME BE THE CONNECTION.

ALL THE BEST FOR NOW

Every night we put out cat food for the wildlife that live behind our house. As we were standing outside smoking a cigarette and waiting for the raccoons to come out, my partner mentioned how nice and clear the sky was. She told me to look at a particular star that was much bigger and brighter than the others. As we both looked at this star, we noticed that it was glowing. I had never seen a star glow like this...all of a sudden this star turns a red color and then a greenish color and then back to a white glow. We start trying to figure out whether this may be a weather balloon or some kind of plane but it's not moving. As we are talking we see much much higher up....another star doing the same. Automatically we assume this may be some kind of satelite giving off signals..which is really interesting to us, being that we had just moved from a big city and have never seen anything like this. We kept our eyes on this communication for about 5 minutes....all of a sudden this star starts to move from left to right. I think for a moment that it can be our eyes playing tricks on us....and I quickly position my self under a tree. I know for sure that this star was moving because I have a tree branch to help me figure that out. The object or star is moving while the tree branch is still. The bigger and closest star quickly dissapears and then reappears...I tell my partner not to move that I'm going in to get a camera because what we were watching didn't seem normal. I come out and take at least a dozen pictures on a digital camera. We were out a total of 35 minutes watching this. Watching these 2 stars communicating, moving etc....I don't know what it is we were watching..but the reason why I am posting this experience is because there are 2 things that don't make sense. #1 the objects/stars disappeared a minute from each other. #2 The camera only picked up the stars (although very blurry) surrounding the one cha! nging colors, but not the one that was changing colors.

3 craft on  interstate 80 west took control of my auto

Oh gee, where to start?... Um...  I was on my way to see my sister-in-law in Cleveland OH.  It is about a six to seven hour drive (depending on how you drive) from New York City.  I have made this trip several times alone; in fact, I should have been a trucker with all the miles I place on my vehicles a year.  I had taken a half-day from work so I could sleep and be well rested for the long drive.  I packed a few bottled waters, some Ritz crackers, and a handful of grapes.  I do not drink coffee, I do not smoke, and I do not use those ?no doze? pills.  If I am tired, there is always a rest area or the side of the road.  Therefore, I guess I can say I was ready to travel, wide-awake, and not under any influences.

The roads were empty, the main reason I travel at night, and the weather was slightly cloudy.  The last sign I recall seeing was the Chesapeake Watershed indicator- lets you know this area sends its water to VA.  I had very little company trucking wise on 80, they were all moving way to fast for me.  (Should anyone recall my little auto, I pulled into the passing lane to let you all fly by.  Something about lane changes at those speeds in large vehicles frightens me.)  It was uneventful driving.

I would say halfway through PA, the sky cleared.  There were no headlights in my mirrors and no tail lights as far as I could see.  The stars came out.  I have a telescope and star gaze often.  I pulled over on the shoulder between mile markers.  (I am going back shortly and will get the exact mile.)  I was on 80 west.  Using 80 as true west and seated in my auto, the Orion constellation was to the south-southeast declination + 40 to 45 degrees and the moon was left of Orion and almost directly behind me, almost due east.  It was half full, waning, and declination of +30 to35 degrees on horizon almost lining up with the tip of Orion?s extended right arm.  To see Orion I had to turn and look out both driver front and back windows.  The moon was in the farther most corner of the back driver?s side passenger window.  It was so far back in the window that I got out to look up at the sky.  It was clear as glass.  There were no streetlights or houses or the glare form a town to interfere.  I saw some stars I haven?t seen in a while living in the city.  I sat on the boot of my auto for maybe 8 minutes just looking up.  I can say 8 minutes because the song ?Blue? was playing and it is just about 8 minutes long.  Ah, size!  The moon was about the size of a racquetball at arm?s distance, it was very bright.  The ground was cast in the silvery blue of moonlight.  Bright enough that when I got back in my auto I drove several miles before I realized my headlights were not on.  Orion seemed to occupy the space of a standard mouse pad at arm?s length.

Well, a Wal-Mart truck screamed by and I heard some roadside gravel hit my auto prompting me to get back in and go.  I gave one last look at the sky and remarked aloud to myself how the three sisters in Orion?s belt seemed brighter than normal.  I shook it off as I could see all the stars for a change and maybe that was it.  Again, it was such a bright moon; I drove without lights for a few miles before a passing FedEx honked me into turning them back on with quickness.  I think I drove for about 30 minutes, there was some light traffic from the trucks, and they passed me and I blinked them back over.  I passed a rest area and had 80 to myself again: no lights in the mirrors or taillights before me.

As you can imagine, 80West turns here and there.  Orion moved in my windows almost to the front.  I just needed to glance out my window without turning to see him.  This is where it becomes weird.  I shall endeavor to do my best.

The three sisters in Orion?s belt seemed to grow as I drove.  No, I was not tired.  I have not had the pleasure of highway hypnosis.  I was munching my crackers and trying to sing.  A line of 8 trucks, Wal-Mart, G.O.D, J.B. Hunt, and several municipal waste carriers flew by frightening the life out of me that I pulled off the road on the center shoulder.  It was not enough that I expeditiously moved into the passing lane to get out of the way of these maniacs.  No, they were barreling down in both lanes, blinking, and honking as they passed each other, almost drag racing and advancing on my little blue ?90 Toyota Camry sedan with bright lights blaring.  There was not choice but off the road completely.  I sat there until I was certain they were miles ahead of me.  If I were sleepy, under highway hypnosis, or just lost in my head, I was fully awake and alert now.  I eased back on 80W letting a few fellow travelers pass me.  A pickup from IL that had Truck on it?s tag, a green Lexus, a tow-truck towing a racing team trailer, All Car Racing Team-white, silver, and maroon formula racing car logo on the back ramp.  Then I was alone again.

I looked up to Orion out my window and for a moment saw six sisters.  Then suddenly they were three.  I thought my eyes failed to focus, but the three sisters were huge then back to normal size.  I drove on with a mounting feeling that something was just not right.  I kept watching the belt of Orion.  They were getting bigger and brighter and to my horror closer.  Panic started to grip me as I turned another bend.  That is when I realized what might be happening.  God, I?m seeing a UFO.  There were three spheres of bluish white light just of center of Orion?s belt.  If not for the bend in the road, they would have aligned just perfect.  They were just about the size of a dime at arm?s length.

Nah, I am just tired.  I poured one bottle of cold water on my head, just to be certain.  I looked out and they were still there.  I looked with earnest; maybe this was night balloon flight.  I have been on one and it is eerie.  Hot air balloons with lights shining up from the gondola into the balloon giving it an otherworldly glow.  I saw no burners and the shapes were perfectly round.  I stepped a lot harder on the gas.  Every abduction scenario I have ever heard raced through my head.

Not me!  I grabbed my mobile: no signal.  I topped 95 MPH and my car began to shake.  All I wanted to do was get to other people, another traveler, truck even- just not alone.  I had to bring it back down to 80MPH to stop the shaking.  My eyes kept a watch on the three lights.  They seemed to be following me.  I glanced at the radio 2 am.  I looked back out the window and they were gone.  I craned my neck to see out every piece of glass and saw nothing.

WHEW! This was a relief.  They were gone.  I eased of the gas and coasted to about 50MPH.  I opened the last bottle of water and poured it on my head.  I was sitting in a puddle, but it was preferable to ((deleted)) probing.  I eased my poor auto around the next corner and freaked.  All three balls of light were headed straight at me.  Yes, sure I though it was a vehicle in the wrong lane headed straight at me but this highway is split in half by some serious hills and valleys.  You would have to be suicidal to drive the wrong way.  However, they were at the tops of the trees ruling out a truck or car.  I feared for my life.

My steering wheel suddenly started twisting left and right, swerving me all over the road.  I gripped it so tightly trying to keep control, I put a blood blister on my right thumb.  The more I fought the harder it became to control.  It seemed to me that the lights were controlling my auto.  In that clarity that comes in absolute terror, I let my steering wheel go.  They obviously were more powerful than I was and if they had control of my auto, how was I going to get it back?  I resigned myself to ((deleted)) probing and let go of the wheel.  The moment I let go, my car straightened out and the lights surrounded me.  There was one on the front bumper and one on each side.  They guided my auto on 80 for a few minutes, send beams into my auto, attempted communication, and then they shot up into the stars and were gone.  When I looked back at the clock it was saying about 2:15 am.  It seemed much longer.

I got a very good look at their details.  They were perfectly spherical.  They all seemed to be identical.  The one on my door is the one I studied.  It was about 2 meters in diameter, made of a metal, and every millimeter was seamed in an intricate lattice.  It looked as if the latticework were the actual joins that made the sphere.  There was no external openings for the light or any propulsion jets.  It seemed to be bending light around it.  I felt vibrations like an electric shaver pulsing through me.  I saw what looked like the ripples from the hot pavement in the heat of summer pulsing just between it and my car door.  Perhaps it is some sort of energy field that pulled it through the air and now was holding my auto.  Between each sphere and my auto was this ripple, maybe some magnetic field that allowed them to control my auto.  There was no sound, not even my auto.  The engine had stopped.  The timbre of the tires sounded as if I were driving through snow.  The power to my dashboard dimmed, all the lights just barely faded out.

The spheres changed color.  I could not detect the source of the lighting.  They went from the white blue of twinkling stars to a dim silvery blue almost the shade of the moon light on the ground then back to the white blue.  The sphere in front changed to a pale washed out sea foam green.  Then as it an aperture had opened a beam of that same pale green light shot out through my engine to me covering my pelvis.  It felt as if someone had struck me with a bat.  Not so much pain as being forced back into my seat. The sphere on the passenger side shot a beam through the door at the same level in the same green.  It was very short and painless.  When the beam stopped the sphere changed to the sea foam green.  I turned and looked out my window to see the last sphere change to a deep sapphire blue.

I felt a slight bump, like a high speed bump.  That is when I knew what the ripples were.  My auto was somehow in the air from the moment I let go of the wheel.  It was some kind of force/magnetic beam.  As soon as I touched down, the two green spheres changed to a pulsing red and shot up into the sky. The blue sphere was still at my side.

It opened my window.  (I sure as heck was not going to open it.)  I could see the entire sphere.  The intricate lattice seemed to glow in a deep purple.  Below it on the pavement, the air seemed to be buzzing, not rippling like before.  The sphere was about eye level with me as if trying to stare me down.

A bright light blinded me hitting me square in the face.  I could feel its warmth on my skin, feel the same electric razor vibration, and I could not see.  I was paralyzed with fear.  I could not move, scream, speak, think-anything!  Suddenly there was this mechanical voice.  It sounded as if it came from inside my head.  It felt as if it were all around me.  It said, ?sorry for your loss.  It is our loss as well.?  It was like a machine trying to imitate a sound it never heard before.  It was monstrous and harsh, but is had sincerity in it as well.

I could move.  The light was gone.  I reached out to touch the sphere, but before I could raise my hand, it turned red and shot into the sky.  I stuck my head out the window (I know fatal mistake).  It joined the other two and they blinked out of sight in less than a second.  When I say joined I mean as a group not into one unit.

My auto started.  The lights on my dash came back up.  It said 2:15am.  I was going about 5 MPH.  A truck horn made me stand on the gas and get out of its way.

The unknown object was seen on the sky, not so high and not so low.  Above a deserted area but not far from homes.  I was driving along with five other people when, I being the driver was checking what was ahead of me and that's when I saw a strange object in the sky with a bright orange/yellow light blinking on/off.  That's when I told the other passangers to check that out and everyone agreed that it wasn't an airplane or a helicopter.  All the passangers and I have lived in this town for quite some time and we know the difference between most of the airplanes and helicopters because El Paso has an airport, army base, and it's a border town.  We always have commercial airplanes,army jets, and helicopters in the sky so we already know how they look and sound. But this object was just floating in the sky for about 4-6 minutes in the same place.  The object didn't move from that exact place in those 4-6 minutes it was just flashing a orange/yellow light on and off.  Then suddenly the object will move forward and backward in a very rapid speed.  We could se it really close because it wasn't that high in the sky, and we could see the fast speed it moved forward and backward and then staying in the same place again were it was floating the first time.  No commercial airplane, helicopter, or army jet I have seen in this town has moved so fast and be so low.  And I've seen all kinds of army jets, some I saw about a month ago because we had a Air Show and was able to see all kinds of jets.  Then after 4-6 minutes this object suddenly moved from the deserted place to a place were there's more lights were you could find stores,malls, and fast food places.  For what I saw, he was close to a WalMart in east El Paso, just floating in top and flashing the same light again but this time he was floating higher in the sky then the object continued to move further away and I couldn't see it anymore.

I've had to to estimate the dates since this was about 4 years ago. I was in training at Fort Gordon (military base) in the 31-R course (Tactical Multi-Channel Transmission Systems Operator Maintainer). We were on a very large open field that we called ""The antenna field"" thats right behind the PX at Fort Gordon, there's also some old barracks that are no longer used (more useless information: These old barracks were used [as the barracks] in the Clint Eastwood movie ""Heart Break Ridge""). We were learning how to install the 9 meter antenna mast (used with a Radio Access Unit). It requires a minimum of 3 soldiers to install (although I've figured out a way that ONE troop could do it), we had four soldiers and one of our two civilian instructors (GTE employees - working for the GTE Resident School, Now called the General Dynamics Resident School). I was holding the Kevlar anchor cable, getting ready to lock it down - we were almost done making adjustments, when I heard the soldier to my right (Private Shaw) SCREAM at the top of his lungs ""LOOK AT THAT %#*(^%  UFO!!"" (thats exactly what he said). I looked up and saw a HUGE light streaking across the sky at incredible speeds. I dont know what I could compare it to since it was like nothing I've ever seen in my life. The civilian instructor didn't even look up, and he yelled at ME for taking my eyes off the anchor cable! (he yelled ""((name deleted)) pay attention to what your doing!""). So I looked down just long enough to lock the cable down (less than one second) and when I looked back up it was gone. Several nights later we were putting up a 30 meter mast and not every team would end up working because it took the entire duration of a class to do (and not enough masts for each group) so on this night my team was in a large white tent watching movies (most of which sucked) and eating crappy chinese food. I was bored with the movie so I went outside & looked up (still freaking out because of the previous sighting several days ago). I saw a bright lig! ht in the sky far off in the distance. One would have mistaken it for a star if not familiar with the constelations (which I am). It was sitting inside of Orion - I knew it didn't belong there (there's only supposed to be SEVEN stars in the Orion constelation). It didn't move for about 5 hours - even as the stars moved away from it through out the night (I kept going back out & kept track of it) it stayed in the same spot - it's position in relation to the constelations continued to change as the stars moved through the sky. I only stared at it for about 15 minutes each time (how long can you stare at ANYTHING before you get bored?). Towards the end of the night I went back outside & noticed that the light was no longer there - but there were about 6 Black Hawk helicopters flying all the way AROUND the spot where it was. They were NOT passing THROUGH the area where the light was! (even though it was no longer there) But going ALL THE WAY AROUND that area! I know my description drags on & on, but I have done my best to be as accurate as possible.","Acting Supervisor - Transportation Security Administration",30,1,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1998,1990,1,3,18,"Evening","South",1,0,0,0,0

I was a light blonde Dutch-cut little girl of 4 yrs old, the daughter of a college prof. My mother was watching my younger brothers 3 and 2 in the house. We lived Route 30 West about 6 miles outside of Gettysburg, near Belmont Rd. Often I was let out of the house to play in this foot-high weedy grass field and I played alone.

I could see the house but I was 25' away from the house. I remember sitting in the grass then something picked me up by my arm and dragged me thru the grass. This being was in a solid shiny material and I believe it was charcoal grey. This being had no feelings for my being dragged over the ground. It flew across the ground. I saw a cigar shaped metallic grey craft positioned on the ground below the hill. The field has a slope and this meant the craft would not be seen from Belmont or Rte 30 West. I was terrified. A being in a buff colored tight outfit came up from the center of the craft, as up a ladder, to meet us. I was hauled inside where they put me on a table. I remember struggling to get away and being so afraid. Painful probes were put inside my nose and mouth. Weeks later I had pain in my lower abdomen and would experience pain every time I breathed. I remember thinking that they were communicating without talking which I now know is telepathically.  They had no feelings, ice-cold machinelike qualities which terrified me. I didn't remember ears or hair like we have and I think with hypnosis I might be able to recall more about them. I couldn't sleep well for weeks. In Sunday school I remembered that angels flew and I thought I was being hurt by angels. I couldn't tell my parents because I had not the language to describe this and I was terrified to relive this experience.  Also, I played an angel in my grandmother's church for a Christmas play and decided that I could never burst my parents' belief about angels being bad.  I remember thinking that I was going to die as they worked on me with metal and tubes and painful implements. At one point I think I went into shock. When I came to, at one point, I was levitated in the air about 5' off a table. There were these beings sitting around the table looking up at me.  I think they were examining my genitals and reproductive organs. During the time I entered the craft I could not speak. It was if I was paralyzed. Later I remember thinking that time had stopped and I wondered how they could have done that. I believe that the craft was moving at some point and I was placed against a wall in an upright position.

I can't remember much else but when I was able to go home from the field my legs and arms were badly bruised.  I had missed lunch but my mother thought that I was not hungry as I often came home on my own. I'm not sure if she thought I may have gone up to the neighbor's house (they let us play in their field) and got food there which sometimes I did. I believe that I was gone more than was revealed by earth time.My father came home and saw me.  He was very upset and accused my mother of abusing me.  I was taken to a physician the next day for an exam. The local practitioner believed that I was showing the sudden bruising signs of leukemia.  I kept assuring my dad and mom that nothing was wrong and that mom hadn't hurt me.  I never told them about the ""angels.""  To this day only my husband and children know about my abduction.  Exploratory surgery was performed on me soon after and bone marrow was taken from both my right thigh and my left kneecap.  The findings were negative.

When I was in my 20's an unpaid psychic approached me in FL where I was living at the time. She explained that I had indeed been abducted by aliens and that I am still being monitored by them.

The area is farmed out but is also generally wooded near the Blanco Bend River. Between 10:00 and 10:30pm on the aforementioned date, ((name #2 deleted)) was walking home from a nearby fast food restaurant. He was aware of the time because he had just gotten a new watch recently and was looking at it frequently. It was a quiet, dark and very cool evening with clear skies and bright stars. The new moon occurred on this night so the sky was moonless.

((name #2 deleted)) happened to look skyward in order to observe some of the constellations, ""And there it was!"", he said. His first thought was, What the hell is THAT?"" He was not afraid, he said, but was amazed. He had considered himself to be sceptical about UFO's, so the experience was impressive and highly elating.

  The object was triangular in shape, but it was as if the points of the triangle had been cut off. The cut was perpendicular to the bisection of the anglefor the leading apex, and the other two points were either cut the same as the leading apex or cut perpendicular to the trailing edge of the UFO.

((name #2 deleted)) raised his armto an angle of about 60? as an indication of the initial zenith angle relative to him. He could see only the underside surface of the object and it was glowing faintly orange over it's entirety, like very hot metal.There were no lights and no visible protuberances, but ((name #2 deleted)) did appear to notice what appeared to be geometric shapes on the surface, formed with straight lines. He believes that these were part of the objects structure, rather than decals (painted). He said that the object was ""remarkably similar"" to those depicted in the ""Unsolved Mysteries"" segment on Belgium UFO's.

((name #2)) aproximated the arms-length size of the object to be 4""-4.5"" (or 10-12 times the size of a full moon). He guessed that the object must have been over 1000 feet away, but then indicated that he was not too good with scales or distances.

The vehicle was moving very slowly and in a straight line from south to north (from his right to his left) perpendicular to his walking direction. There was no sound of any kind from the vehicle or otherwise-including no dogs barking. (Any dogs barking would probably have been due to the presence of the object.) He was so taken by the once sighting that he never once gave thought to the possibility that other such objects may have been in the area. ((name #2)) said that he must have watched the object for ten minutes before it passed out of site behind the trees. It never changed speed, direction or altitude during that time. After the object disappeared from view, ((name #2)) continued to stand and look for several minutes, totally awestruck by the experience.

Immediately upon returning home, ((name #2)) called the Hays County Sheriff's Department and reported the sighting. The Dispatcher told him that THERE HAD BEEN OTHER CALLS REGARDING A UFO SIGHTING THAT VERY EVENING! Later, early Monday morning, ((name #2)) called a local Austin FM Radio Station and told a DJ friend of his sighting. After watching the NBC Network's UNSOLVED MYSTERIES program on the Belium UFO's during the late fall of 1991, ((name #2)) called their 800 number and reported his sighting.

 In March Of 1992, ((name #2)) called an Austin ************** group who referred him to someone named ((name #3)) (doesn't remember last name). ((name #3)) pointed ((namd #2)) to some woman (name not remembered) who referred him to Austin MUFON. On March 23, 1992, ((name #2)) called Austin MUFON and told Mrs. ***** ****** of his sighting. ((name #4)) provided an outline of the sighting to me on March 28, 1992 at a regular MUFON meeting. Scott also called the Hays County Sheriff's Department to get more information on the UFO sighting. He was told that they had no record of his report or any other report of the UFO.

I heard Peter express interest in experiences of those who have had UFO encounters in the past as well as present, so after hearing this, I was compelled to share this. Please forgive the explanation, because I've never formally reported anything like this before. But after hearing the stories tonight, I had to share...

All of the times reported above are not exact. This first experience happened when I was 17 while driving from Bullhead City back to Phoenix, AZ. I was doing a scheduled pickup & delivery from Bullhead City with my cousin around sunset. As we approached a large mountainous rock formation, the road curved around it. Before we even got to the curve, we both saw a very large ball of light cross the sky slowly (separate of the sun), and stop dead in the air near the rock formation we were approaching. We both were stupified, and couldn't shake the feeling of wanting to rush over to this light. So I remember speeding up, and then slowing down and pulling over to the side of the road. We both got out, and walked toward this ball of light. I specifically remember looking back at my cousin in disbelief because this proved not to be just a reflection off of the glass of the windshield from the vehicle we were driving. I also remember walking with him closer to this ball of light. The sun was going down, and by this point, you could actually see that this ball of light was now higher in the sky than we saw originally. And to make things even stranger, this ball of light seemed to move away, just as we would get closer. At the closest I can remember, we were about 100-200 meters away. Next thing we know, both of us were cussing, and we were both scared. I still to this day cannot remember why we were feeling scared. My heart was racing, and we both ran back to the vehicle, jumping in, and started it up. The only strange thing that completely made me get scared was the fact that I don't remember seeing this ball fly away. My cousin doesn't either. Even more, it was complely dark when we were running back to the vehicle. By the time we got back to Phoenix, it was dark night. When we got back, my uncle cussed us out, and accused us of taking the vehicle for joyrides and paryting. We didn't do any such thing. But instead, we just agreed with him and took our punishment for fear of ridicule, and not being beleived. We had also realized that there was at least 45 mins. to and hour of missing time.

A similar experience happened to me again way later when I was stationed in Hawaii with the ((deleted/military unit). At the time, our battalion was sent to the big island of Hawaii for training. The training area is located in the very middle of the big island of Hawaii. It's called P.T.A. (Pohakuloa Training Area). Anyway, this PTA is located between the 2 volcanoes. I was ((deleted/on assignment)), it was like 0300 hrs, and I was facing North I beleive (there's an observatory on the top of the volcano). Anyway, since I was on ((assignment)) for 2 hours, and because it's so incredibly beautiful there (the sky has literally millions of stars which can be visible on a clear night). Well, I was viewing the sky through my NVGs (Night Vision Goggles), and looking in the direction of the observatory in the North.

After looking for like 4 minutes at shooting stars, something to the left caught my eye. Actually, the NVGs flashed brightly to my left, so I put them down because I thought that some dumb soldier was using a white light (which is totally against field rules during training or combat). When I put down the NVGs, I saw a brigh light approach silently from the West (my left) toward my position. As it got closer, it increased in brightness. As it got close enough to see that it was perfectly round, it stopped in the air. I called in on my telelphone to report, and they thought I was joking. When I told the Sgt. to come out and look, he did, and about 10 seconds after speaking with him, the light got very bright, and then shot across the sky. What makes this sighting even more crazy is that maybe not even 4 minutes after this ""fireball"" shot across the sky, a large group (maybe 10 or 15) of wild boarhogs came running through our position as if something was chasing them. Normally, these boarhogs don't usually just come runnning through, especially when we have our battery setup. They might come in individually to scrounge around for food, but you won't normally see them just ""stampede"" through like they did that night. Out of all the many times I had to go out to the field for training there in PTA, I never experienced another stampede of boarhogs again. I also didn't see another fireball there either.

Later the next day, I was questioned by my Platoon Sgt, and Commander about what had occurred. I reported it, and they made no visible reaction, other than telling me that it was from one of the volcanoes. There is no way that this was from a volcano. The ball stayed in mid air for that whole time, and then shot across the sky. I've never seen any lava do that before. The area we were moving around in was in a large valley, with wide open spaces, and very dusty fields. We weren't even close to the active volcano, or to the black rocked lava fields. The space is very wide open, with the occasional ""PU"" here and there. (A PU is the Hawaiian word for large hill) When we finally got out of the field after over 2.5 weeks, it was big talk. Apparently, MANY other soldiers who were also in the area from the other batteries saw it too.

I was on a annual summer camp trip from Ukiah, CA. to Calavera's county in 1951 when an event happened that changed my whole life!  I had spent that day as any normal kid would, playing with my best friend then we raced across a small creek and my foot was cut through my tennis- shoes.  The cut was very deep across the pad behind my left big toe.

 My friend ran to get a Conselor to help me.  The cut would not stop bleeding.

He carried me on his back piggy style.  I had to pull my pant leg cuff to hold my foot up because of the throbbing pain.  I went to bed that night as the other boys did, (gabbing til sleep).  Somewhere in the night I woke up and startled as heck, realized I was sleeping on the cement serving place.

 The cement circle was where the conserlors set all the giant serving food pots which was about 4 to 6 blocks from our cabin.

 What woke me was this weird blue-ish green light that I could see with my eyes closed.  It was about 2 telephone poles above me slowly rising with a small noise in my head.  It looked like a huge (city block wide) black disk with pieces of silver around it's edges.  In the center was that blue-ish green light.  It slowly rose over me straight up then zipped out of sight.

 I wasn't scared, I was actually very calm and relaxed untill I noticed where I was, (in the wilderness at night) I got up, steped down off the cement circle and yelled in pain!  I forgot my foot was injured.  All the pain came back again as I tried to walk on that heel.  As I entered the dark cabin, I accidently went to my best friends bed and grabbed the covers, (It was my friends neck I grabbed and boy did he yell) I tried to tell him what went on, but the other kids yelled , 'shut-up!'.  The next morning we saw my bloody foot prints coming from the cabin front door to my friends bed.

 I tried to explain to our 'conselors' what happened and they said, I must be mistaken, there's only God in the heavens.  And then the memories came back.  A female entity, large head, giant shinny black cat eyes, dull white skin tone, small being. It sounded like a soft gentle female.  It spoke to me with tenderness.  She said her name was, I couldn't say it right, so she said,'NANE' that's close enough.  She said she was the leader of a force that protected her planets security.  In an instant, we were on a planet who's color looked like white-ish grey everywhere. My feet weren't on the ground and she said, It's not safe for you. I said where am I, she said, your at the 'place of ashes'  she said, you call it The moon.  She said a huge civilization lived there a long time ago.  She said, those craters are not from things hitting the moon, their from a great all out war that destroyed the planet.  She pointed to a UFO in the distance and said, many visitors from other planets come to the 'place of ashes' to remember, and collect 'artifacts' to take home. She said the Universe was a big giant highway,just like our highways on earth. When she talked, I didn't see her mouth move, I heard her in my mind.  She told me about different UFO's, aliens, planets, She said the story of 'Jesus Christ' was just that,a story She said governments on earth just used it to control the people! She said, do you think a real all loving God would let Disease,murder,war,hatred,- death,natural disasters exist!!!!?  She said she could do everything and more all by herself than anything I've ever read. She has visited me about 3 times and say's she's always near.  She has shown me and told me so much that it's sort of scary!  I am now a movie actor with one academy award film and I still don't talk about my encounter to anyone. (people think your crazy as the government likes it to be on this topic!) All I can say is, my life 's not the same since that encounter!!!  I can do many,many, different things that I never studied, perfectly!  When I look into a persons eyes, or touch them it's like a fast visual movie of their life!(I don't like it at all!!!) When that visual thing happens, it makes me want to throw-up!(feels like I'm going to die!) I've learned so much from'NANE' that it would take a lot of writing to explain it, and it's coming true!  I'm going to write an E-Book on the net about, 'NANE' and give it away free, just download it.  I want other people to know what happened to me! And just maybe, just maybe, there's others who were visited that night and I could meet them.  There's so much more she said that I believe is perfectly true!  The free 'NANE' E-Book has been ready to download but, I'm a little worried about my movie career! Will people think I've lost my mind!? A person can only shut their mouth for so long!  Time to tell the other people what happened! She showed me so much! I hope all read this with intelligence and wisdom for it will come to pass!!!

i was driving towards the early hours of 4am melbourne, australia. while driving along the freeway at a dark traffic-less rd i glanced towards the south-east direction of the sky. at that moment i saw 2 flying objects floating or going at a very slow pace, i dont know if it was going fast or slow assuming the fact i was driving and moving at the same direction these object were headed.

the distance of these objects appeared close to sea level (around 500 meters above).

the objects had no lights and i could clearly see the colour of blue/greenish from that distance or maybe perhaps some reflection of the sea nearby made it visible to the eye.

figuring out the shape was the next thing comes to mind, it was a flat type almost like a saucer but from the angle im at, i dont know what shape it would look like if i was to see it side-to-side.

around 2 mins of witness this object, it seems that it is becoming aware. i distanced itself from my point of view, it was going towards the sea. it manouvered almost at a glanced-speed. it was faster than any craft-type object that i have EVER seen. all of a sudden 2 more object, exactly the same, appeared side-by-side, making a ""four on a dice"" formation. from my angle it was a diamond formation.

im sure it wasnt a plane or birds because it had no wings and no sound or movement involving as i rolled down my window constanly glancing at the object.

the objects subconciously followed the direction of where im headed, except it was in front the whole time. around 15mins later, i glanced once again and starting to shift away from my point of view, almost disappeared towards the dark grey sky. thats the part where i couldnt figure out where it went or how it disappeared.

on the same stretch of road there was only 2 witness that had the same description that i found out 45 mins later because for an early morning break at a local food station.

we exchanged numbers and information about the sightings. the two people who witnessed the sightings contacted the bureu of investigation in melbourne, australia and still pending.

My friend and I were sitting outside on swinging seats facing each other talking while we were waiting for the food we were barbequed to be cooked. My friend shouted to look at what he saw but I thought he was joking so ignored his cries. Finally I realized he wasn?t kidding and turned around only to see an object in the sky. It was visible over a tree in the distance. I was able to determine it was large in size. The object was a silver flat disk that was silver bordered by black with a concave center. The object was silent emitted no light. The object appeared to move effortlessly almost as if it was gliding on ice. The object wobbled slightly than immediately vanished. The whole incident only took place over the course of 25 seconds.

I was working on a master's degree in music ((deleted)) at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  I was going home to Dayton, Ohio for the week-end so it was probably a Friday. I am not sure of the date-it was cold outside and I think in late fall when this occurred.  I wish I had written down the date. I had traveled the same route at least 50 times since I was married and tried to get back to Dayton every other week-end.  I was coming out of Ft. Wayne around midnight on Rt. 30 (33?).  There is a long stretch there where there is a McDonalds.  Up ahead of me I saw a huge bright white light that was about the height of lights at a football stadium.  I wondered what it could be since I had never seen it before traveling this route.  It came closer and closer moving slowly.  I pulled off of the road into the McDonald's parking lot and got out of my van and stood watching it.  It appeared to be very large with the white light on the front and it had a green, a red and a purple light on the body of it.  It was large and flew slow and silently.  I know this sounds weird but I could not make out the shape of the craft even as close as I was to it.  I could only see the lights and from the spacing of the lights I knew it was very large.  It flew slowly towards Ft. Wayne and then disappeared out of sight.  I looked all the way back to Dayton that night hoping to see another but did not.

My husband and I owned a Book Store in Dayton called Aragon Bookshop.  I went with my husband the next day to work in the store.  Around noon a woman came into the bookstore and asked excitedly if we had a UFO section of books.  I said yes and got up to show her where the books were.  I asked her if she was interested in UFOs and she said ""not until last night.""  I asked her what had sparked her interested the night before.  She said that her and a friend had seen a lot of UFO's late at night.  She said that they were driving near Wright State University when they saw them.  When I asked where she said they were near where all the construction was going on near Colonel Glenn Highway.  She said her and her friend observed them for several hours.  She said that they were afraid to leave to go tell someone as they thoug ht they might not be there when they came back.  She said they had a bright white light on the front and that they had a green, a red and a purple light on them.  She said they would hover and move slowly and then they would zoom off and disappear out of sight traveling at a high rate of speed.  She said there were a lot of them.  She said that the next day she called her relative who was a Colonel at Wright Patterson Air Force Base which is close by where she saw the UFOs'  She described the crafts and he said that there was nothing that the military had that could do what these UFOs did as she described it to him. I relayed my sighting to her of the night before in Ft. Wayne, Indiana.  We marveled at the coincidence of seeing the same type of craft in 2 distant locations on the same night. She bought some UFO books and left.  I often wished I had gotten her name and address so that I could contact her again.

One other little tidbit of information: When I was 19 years old in 1967 and attending Wright State University I lived off of Linden Ave. with a nice lady who let me stay there in exchange for taking care of her children from time to time.  There was a little store on Linden Ave. that I frequented to buy food, stamps and etc.  There was a young man who worked there who I became friendly with.  One time he asked me if I would like to go see the aliens that were at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  He said that his father was a higher up in the military there(I think he said a Colonel) and that his father had taken him to see them before since he had a security clearance to where they were being kept.  he said he could get me in if I wanted to see them.  I was scared to go and declined his offer.  I have regretted that many times since then.

When I was a child I remember seeing a V-shape of lights floating they remained in the same place for about 5 mins and then disappeared. I was this in the sky in North Hollywood Ca. This happen during the early 1980's  In 2001, I lived in La Mesa California and resided in a 2 bedroom apt in a upstairs unit. I remember lying in my bedroom on the bed, and the room was brightly lit. I felt tired, and I asked my live-in boyfriend to go to a nearby taco shop for Mexican food. After he left I dosed off and feel asleep. The next thing know is my boyfriend returns and as he is entering my bedroom, he says very load ""wake up! The food is here"" as I opened my eyes I saw a gray like creature do a spin and disappear near my bedroom window. The first thought that ran through my mind was that after I feel asleep something was in the room with me. I didn?t tell my boyfriend for fear that he would think I was nuts. So, I didn't a word to anyone about what I had seen.

 THE NEXT NIGHT: I had been on my computer most of the night. I then told my boyfriend that I was going to bed early, he stopped watching T.V and joined to go to bed. As we got into to bed I turned the lights off, but the room was lit from a light outside attached to the building. So, the bedroom wasn't completely dark. My boyfriend and I feel asleep after talking for a little while. In the middle of the night I woke up sweating, for some reason I was very hot. I got up from the bed and walked to my right to the corner of the room to wipe my face from sweat with one of the clean towels that I had in a laundry basket on the floor. As leaned down I grabbed the towel and wiped my face, and as I was wiping my face I notice something behind me that seemed to be small quickly run past me I turn to my left and looked to the floor and saw nothing. Then as I laid I dropped the towel, again I saw something moved. I turned to the right side of myself and looked toward the floor and saw nothing, and just as though I am seeing things. I notice something behind me to the left side. I quickly turn and looked and saw this small creature hovelling down to the floor. It had lizard type skin; it was mixed of colors of Black, dark green, dark gray. The little creature stood up and stretched his arms that had attached skin that appeared to be broken wings. The eyes were black and the feet looked liked hoof of a pig or horse. When the little creature aroused up it stood about 8 ft. tall, and it moved in a slow jerking move jerking manner. It stepped across the bed in one step, while it was stepped across the bed boyfriend woke up and tried to yell there was no sound he was only moving in the bed in fear. After the little creature stepped across the bed it turn toward me backing up it's back up away from the bed then it stopped with it's arm and body in a hunch, and sat still. I look at it and wonder how it be so small again, boyfriend was trying to turn on the bedroom light and hear him asking me ""what the HELL is that thing?"" I was speechless and never said a word because the small creature was still in the room looking straight through me. I look down at toward the floor to wonder where its long legs had gone. I notice that was another creature sitting next to it with its head hunched down to fit in the room. This creature was enormous in size. It had I long face with black eyes, it sat like a dog sitting straight up. I notice that it had two horns attached to its head that went straight back, it had the same colors as the little creature, but the feet were different. I so afraid because it was so BIG! That is when began to shake all over. Suddenly, I though about all of the people that said they were abducted and not believed. Then suddenly in a (psychic way) for a quick moment I saw a far away planet, where many humans were and not returned to earth. I was these many of the same type of creatures in a militant stance. They seemed to be angry, and then it all went away. I saw the two creatures standing in the room again. I thought of my children, and thought that I would never see them again. Suddenly I hear the large creature say with an angry tone ""LOOK AT THOSE HUMANS"", that's is when I quickly jump onto the bed and buried my head into the blankets and began praying, I quickly yelled TURN ON THE LIGHT! I don't why I said that. My boyfriend said I'm trying, I'm trying it won't come on. Then suddenly the light comes on, and I jumped toward him, and we look at the direction of the creatures and they were gone.

 All of this seemed like it took place in 5 mins but it was really hours, because I ran out of the room to called my family and noticed the time and it was almost 5:00AM in the morning.

 I don't think that I have ever been that scared in my life. To this day I wonder if anyone else had seen anything like that. I have looked on the Internet and have never come across an event like my boyfriend?s and mine. I do believe that what I saw in that brief vision like moment was these creatures preparing to attack us.

 I am not concerned if this is believe by others and many may say that, but I only wanted to share my story with others just in case they have had experienced the same thing as I did.

Some friends and I were all at a backyard barbeque and one of the guys there asked if I had seen the UFO yet.  I was puzzled and he explained that on WCCO they had reported a white floating thing that hadn't moved for hours.  We all went outside and watched it for a good for hours while we cooked up our food.  The neighbors in the next door yard had a pair of 7x35 binoculars they were using to look at the object and let us take a look.  I saw what appeared to be a pale white orb that was a bit stretched out on the top side.  Like a blunted teardrop, kind of.

 The object appeared to be stationary but during the course of our BBQ, it appeared to have moved from 12 o'clock to about 10 o'clock at a uniform height of 2.5 handspans (arms extended) above the horizon. A dime held at arms length completely obscured the object. I believe that even a popcorn kernel held at arm's length would have covered it.  3 of the 8 of us had about 3 beers apiece over the course of the 4 hours.

 As to our credibility, we are all of sound mind.  I am a military veteran, one of the guys there is a Mennonite/Quaker type guy, one lady is a research biologist, and another works in a health diagnostic lab.  The remainder were college students. Everyone there was of a rational mindset.

 In summary -- 8 of us saw something in the sky that we can't quite explain.  The idea of a balloon was (forgive the pun) floated but the object was far too stationary for that to be true.  Also, it should be noted that as the sun set, the object, suspended above the western horizon, remained consistently luminous -- a large white ""circloid"" with no noticable shading.

 To be honest, we got bored with it after a while and ceased to pay attention to it.  Prior to this we noted it had been drifting relative to the trees.  Left to right, facing west.  When we wondered about it's position around 2100 hours, we weren't able to find it.



((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))

Peter-
 
Yeah, it was Aug 19...the day everyone around here was seeing it.  Sorry about that, I don't usually keep track of the date.  It was all over the radio, TV...and then interest just disappeared.  Odd, you'd think that folks would be interested in knowing what the heck was just floating stationary for such a long period of time.  Most folks just dismissed it with ""weather balloon"".  It might have been but it certainly didn't exhibit balloon like properties, chiefly that whole ""not moving"" thing.
 
Let me know if you learn any more about the flying object that has, to date, been unidentified.
 
Cheers!  ((name deleted))

Being in first calss I could see the panic in the eyes of the flight attendents.  Then two large ovals craft went past the right side of the plane and above us. They were much larger than our craft the first being nickel in color and the second a rust color. They were close enough to see with detail their shape and construction. Then a third craft nickel came by on the same path as the first two.I was in the window seat but the person next to me and those behind on the right side of the flight saw them.  The flight attendant tried to get the attention of the flight crew but it was some time,three or four minutes befour the crew would take their call.  There was a heated conversation and the attendants became very distrssed and talked among themeselves. The cockpit door then came open and the crew told the attendants be calm all the while one person on the crew was on the radio looking for a new flight path and seeking information on the other objects we just missed.  the door remained open and I could here conversation as how how they would fly a new route to Dallas. Later the crew all denied anything varied from the norm  and would not discuss this matter.

This craft had triangle shape and moved from side to side as it moved to the north at a very slow speed.We saw the craft long enough for me to get my nikon from my case and take photos.  The Dr next to me kept the object in view as I got the camera  out. It looked very unstable in movement.



((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))

Peter
 
Thank you for the responce.
 
The date is incorrect but it was within a few months.  There was an airshow scheduled for that weekend in SF, as info was in the news I read prior to the flight.  I can go back through my records and get the exact date if needed.  I mean there was activity brought on by the occurrense taking place with the crew and others on the flight that took place for over one hour.  this includes the crew trying to get an ok to fly over parts of Nevada  that were not normal for the flight.  With the door open to the cabin for a period of time you could overhear the conversations taking place.  Also the attendants spoke of this to each other, about the flight being too far south of norm.

Actual viewing time was short because of proximity of the three craft, at the most a few seconds.  There were no more than 1200 ft away at the most and details in the surface was obvious.  They  all had weatherbeaten look and looked very as if they had been exposed to harsh conditions. Give me a fax number and I will send a drawing of the craft.  When this started I was on the right side of the aircraft but swiched to the left window after our turn to the left and could see all three over the bay bridge moving northeast and gaining altitude and speed. they maintained this course until out of sight.

((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD))","Two bright lights oberserved for two hours in the northern sky above Mount Clemens, Michigan, outside of Detroit.

I observed two lights that appeared to be stars upon first glance, but after closer and longer inspection I came to the conclusion that the two lights were far to bright and also to large to be typical stars.

 The lights came to my attention as I was exiting my driveway at around 4:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, although, I simply disregarded their existance at first as the area that I was viewing them was just 3 miles away from Selfridge Air National Guard Base and to have planes and various other aircraft fly over and around this area are typical on any given day.  I proceeded to drive to a local cafe which had a drive through window and continued to notice the two lights that were fixed in the northern sky. The food order that I had placed took a considerable amount of time (about thirty min.), and I became to be interested when I noticed that these lights could not have been from aircraft as they had stood completely still for slightly more then a half hour. After I collected by food I intentionally drove to a dark secluded parking lot in Harrison Township which is just outside of my mount clemens where I had initially observed the lights, and I parked and gave careful consideration to their continued existance.  Upon closer observation and comparision to various stars that appeared in the same area as these lights I could see that ALL of the stars that were in the sky were so lacking in their brightness in comparision to the lights that I had now been observing for an hour that there was no way that they were anything except that of being man made in their nature.

 After about two hours of careful observation the lights still remained in exactly the same location as when I first observed them, fixed very high into the northern sky. After the two hours of my time had passed, I tired and retreated for the night, last viewing the lights at around six a.m. eastern standard time.

Amazing that this happened to me!  As I went outside I heard a cat crying out in pain. Long story short, i found a stay cat that was reall just skin an bones.... it ate 5 cans of cat food... :\  But as I was feeding this poor kitty, I saw a bright white light off in the distance. I would say it was SOUTH WEST of true north.

 This is not the first UFO I have seen in these parts. Last time I saw a UFO WEST of my location.

 I live OUTSIDE of Edmonton, Alberta.

 I am near 2 SMALL air ports. So I see alot of planes. I even remeber once I saw a black unmarked helecopter as a child that flew no more than 10-20 feet over out house... I never thought about the importance of that incedent till recently. See as how thoes unmarked helecopters have been reported many times when it came to UFOs and even more CATTLE mutalations. Altought as far as I know I personly have not heard of cattle mutalations in my area.

 Anyways, as I was feeding this poor cat, I saw a bright light off in the distance. Off in the direction of SHERWOOD PARK. It is a town outside of Edmonton. I wanted to eyeball this light as long as I could, but trying to keep attention to the poor sick cat and the fact that small trees where in my way. I did not stay entirely focused to it.

 I would say about a minute or 2 after I saw the bright light, it just vanished.

 I would say it was VERY far away, but it could not of been a star consider how low it was to the horizen.

 This time of year up here it gets dark quite quickly, and I can honestly say I have never seen a star that was that bright at this time, or even moved around for that matter.

 This bright object moved around a tiny bit within the 1 to 2 minutes I watched it. It did not move in random patterns... But I would say it moved UP... not UP UP like into space or the atomsphere, but UP....

 It was a LARGE distance away, but no plane or anything of that nature could produce such a bright light from that far away.

 I really wanted to get my binoculars, so I could view the object, but being only human, I could only help the poor starving cat. I lost site of the object, (from my view from beyond the trees) quite quit.

 All the trees around here have lost thier leaves, but I still was not wearing my glasses. But for a bright object to dissapear like that within the time period and direction it was moving and the fact there was no red or blue lights, which rules out any airplane, just leaves me boggled.

 I lived on farm land, and from whats I have noticed on this web site is that sometimes ""Advertizing lights"" can be a factor in a UFO report. But let me tell you this, never have I heard or seen or even considered the fact that advertising lightings will be within or around the area of Edmonton, Alberta.

 OH, and if your wondering, the stray cat is at a SAFE shelter now. :) By now he will of been adopted.

 If I had to estimate the distance of the object I would say......

 Quite far.....

 From my current location, I would say I was still a large distance away...

 Even if I got over to the closest highway, I would still say I was still 1/6 distance away from it.

 It was far... but very bright.

  FYI: I also saw this object, while an Meteor shower was occouring, and I can tell you that this was no Meteor.

I think it was late summer or start of fall, in 2002. We were visiting family at my husbands sisters house, then me and him left in my car to go get food for everyone, it was about 8:30 PM.  We were in a pretty suburban area. Houses on blocks, apartments, a YMCA right near by. We were driving along a straight stretch and my husband said ""oh my goodness that plane is gonna crash"". I thought he was joking told him playfully to shut up and then he said ""no seriously."" I looked in my rear view mirror and saw a large black object coming overtop of a hill behind us. It was sort of wobbling side to side like it was about to lose control, and it was dangerously low and close to the power lines, then it seemed to sort of start getting control again. I stopped my car right in the middle of the street, there was no other traffic around. I turned around and started looking out the back window. It was going very slow and then about not even 200 feet behind my car it stopped and started to just hover. I was like a straight up triangular shape looked almost as if you drew a big letter A, standing straight up in the sky. It was black very sleek and on one side it was completely covered with lights, green, red and yellow. They were all blinking and there had to be 200 hundred of them. We just set there in awe. Then all of a sudden it took off. It left so fast you could almost see lines in the air after it (another strange thing I noticed when it took off it made no sound at all, any other aircraft you would have heard take off noise, it just zipped off with nothing). I just went on impulse through my car into drive and tried to follow. I was going about 90 mph trying to follow it. I saw a ramp unto the highway and by the time I got up on the highway we could only barely see the lights of the UFO way off in the distance. When we got back to his sisters house I couldn't help but try to tell them what we had seen. NO one believed us. So, we haven't really talked about it since. Has anyone else seen a UFO like that?

I was around 17 years old at the time, walking home down 153 street between Courtlandt Avenue and Morris Ave. with chinese takeout food.  It was around 9:00pm and the sky was pretty clear. 

From the corner of my right eye up on the sky I spotted some lights. At first because the lights were so bright, I thought it was some kind of fireworks, but the lights never disolved. Instead the object moved silently from north to south. My building where I lived is 14 stories tall, and the object seemed it was about triple the height of the building. 

The large object had about 9 lights, 5 in the front almost in a octigon shape and the about 4 lights tailing it.  All the lights moved as if the object was one. I got the impression it was one object. I was amazed, something that large, that close didn't make any noise what so ever.

I have seen blimps in the past, and you could hear them.  This was no blimp. Also, a few months later, I saw on TV a home video that someone took showing  the same craft I witnessed.

This occured about 9:00-9:30 p.m.  

I was driving home from the grocery store and it was lightly raining.  It's all residential where I was driving, and something caught my eye out to the left.  

There is a lot of pasture that is being developed and as I drove around this winding 2-lane, I looked out to a clearing, and there were these red, blue, yellow, white, lights in a really large triangular shape.  The crazy thing is that this thing was very large and hovering over the ground approximately 2-3 miles up.  

Hanging from this object was like a hose or something being lowered.  It had almost a dull greyish-white neon appearance to it, and at the very bottom was a brighter white light.  I would have to guesstimate that this shaft was approximately 1 block long. The shaft of light appeared to not have a large circumference to it. 

I thought at first it must have been some sort of hose with this light on the end of it. I thought is this thing a Stealth and these pilots are just jacking around? But from the way the lights appeared, the V was much wider then the Stealth appears. 

I was a few miles away from it.  At first I thought about trying to get a closer look but I remembered I had a lot of frozen food in sacks.

I was about 6 or so years old.  Several of my brothers and sisters were with me when my mother brought us food shopping.  She had been driving one of those old stationwagons that had the back seat facing out the back window.  

It was summertime, I remember because the back window was wide open.  We were on our way home and I don't remember which of us were sitting back there but as Mom made a right turn we were facing the Wanaque reservoir.  

All of a sudden, as Mom made that turn, we were staring straight at a silver disc hovering not more than 30 feet above the water, only about 50 feet away from us.  I remember all of the kids screaming at Mom to stop the car.  I just remember all of us screaming, but it wasn't really fear.  More excitement, I believe.  

Well, Mom had to drive up the road a short ways so that she could turn the car around, but by the time we got back there, it was gone.  Mom did see it in the rearview mirror when she heard all the commotion we were making.  The disc was about 50 feet long, shining silver and silent as it hovered.  I nor any of my family reported it.  I'm really not sure why.  

For some strange reason, maybe because we were all so young (I'm second youngest of six)none of us discussed the sighting for years. I've talked to a couple of my siblings about it when we got older.  We all remember it the same way. 

I went to the Ringwood library to see if they had any information or old news clippings about that event. As it turns out, many people saw the same thing.  UFO's seemed to make an appearance for that entire weekend.  People from all around would park there cars around the reservoir day and night and many reported night sightings.  

My mother, who has since passed, remembered men in dark suits but she wasn't sure what they were doing there or how they knew what was going on that weekend.  She was never approached by these men.  

A few years ago, I read a book-Above Top Secret-by Mr.Goode and sure enough, he had reports in his book about the Wanaque reservoir sightings. Since then, I have spoken to a few ""old"" Ringwoodites about whether they had ever had sightings and to my surprise, many had.  But none had seen a daylight sighting. Only the night sightings.

I was traveling down I-75 last night coming back to Lexington, Kentucky from Richmond, Kentucky where I attend graduate school classes.  

It was directly in my line of sight right before the curve towards the Clays Ferry Exit. The sky had a few clouds but it was mostly clear. I saw it straight ahead and I saw a flash of light come from the other side and traveled halfway around the object and stopped.  It did not flash all the way around the object.  It only flashed once.  It was a disk- shaped object that was a dark color like a dark grey or brown, not quite black.  

The interstate wound around and the object was no longer in front of me but it was traveling along to my right.  I was straining my eyes to see legs to a water tower, or helicoptor propellers, or wings to an airplane, but there was none of that.  It was not a water tower because for one thing, I found out that it was moving and there was nothing sticking out of the object like wings or propellers.  It was definitely going too slow to be an airplane.  

The only other thing I could think of would be a blimp of some kind but it didn't have any kind of writing or basket and I don't know if those have lights.  Also, it was 8:00pm on a Monday night and no events going on that would require a blimp that I know of and it simply did not look like a blimp.  However, I am trying to justify this because it goes against everything I believe in or ever thought possible.  

This thing was traveling in my line of sight for about 20 minutes.  When i got off on the Man-o-War  exit I turned the wrong way so that i could follow it and take a clear picture with my camera phone.  By the time I could stop it was too far away to see it in the picture.  My camera phone is not very clear at all, anyway.  It just kept traveling away from me and I gave up and turned back around and went home.

Also I noticed a police officer immediately pull into the parking lot ahead and another one go down a road ahead right under where the object would have been.

My mother, my grandmother, younger brother and I were parked in our Dodge Ram Charger waiting for my father to get out of Foodland.  My father had been working a number of years as a butcher in their meat department.  Our station wagon was in the shop at the time so, we used the Ram Charger to run errands during the day and were forced to pick my father up from work each night until our car was repaired.  The Foodland was located on Campbell Rd. where it intersects with 14 mile rd.  The Foodland no longer exists.  There is a large grocery store in it's place now, and an Outback Steakhouse restaraunt in the parking lot where we witnessed the bizarre aircraft.  We were parked facing the west side of Campbell Rd, waiting patiently for my father to get out of work.  He was scheduled to work until 8 pm that night and that's exactly when we saw it.  Some bright lights began shining through the treeline above the residences along Campbell Rd.  The lights were very low and they were intensely bright.  Although none of us said a word, I later found out that my grandmother and mother had both assumed, as I had, that the lights belonged to a low flying passenger jet.  Eventually the ascending object came into view above the treeline.  All of us were silent for a moment.  At first, we stared at the object in silence, each one of us trying to determine WHAT it was we were all looking at.  When no conclusion could be reached, my mother exclaimed ""Oh my God!"" and we all got out of the Ram Charger for a clearer view of the strange craft.  By the time I had gotten out of the Ramcharger, the aircraft was no longer ascending.  It remained completely still for about 45 seconds and then slowly, very slowly began hovering southbound along the west side of Campbell Rd.  The object appeared to be about 4 to 5 homeyard lengths, though it is impossible for me to judge exactly what our distance was.  From my perspective, it spanned the distance of about 5 of the front lawns of the residential homes it seemed to be hovering above.  The object was shaped like a relatively thin cylinder.  The perimeter of the craft was lined with rectangular lights of extraordinary brightness.  There were very thin slits dividing the lights that were the same shade as the rest of the exterior of the craft: black(or at least how it appeared as a silouhette against the violet sky).  The lights did not move along the perimeter of the vehicle.  They did however look like they were bound by a textured or coagulated transparent surface.  Those lights were the most incredible display of illumination I have ever witnessed.  I could not see any specific details along the exterior of the craft.  Under the lighting conditions, it appeared to be a flat black or at least a very dark brown.  Although I must admit, there was the hum of Campbell rd. and 14 mile rd. traffic from our position, the hovering object made no sound that could be distinguished from the passing cars.  It left no kind of trail in it's wake either.  After about 4 minutes watching the aircraft hover slowly and silently south along Campbell rd, my mother became frightened and began yelling for me to get back in the Ram Charger.  She later told me that she had begun thinking of all of those horrible U.F.O abduction stories she'd heard about and seen on various t.v shows.  At that point, I could only see about one third of the craft anyways.  It had hovered nearly out of sight behind some of the much taller trees.  I obeyed my mother and got back in the truck.  We all waited with inpatience for my father to exit Foodland.  When he got to the vehicle about 5 minutes later, we were all frantically telling him to get in the car and try to spot once more what we had already seen.  My father laughed at first.  He didn't seem to believe our story at all but after a few moments of him observing our enthusiasm over what we had witnessed, he hopped in the truck and started off down Campbell.  The flying vehicle had not been lost from our sight for more than 6 minutes and yet, as we drove further and further south down Campbell, we found that it was no longer visible in any direction.  Even at major intersections such as 13 and 12 mile, where we looked back to see if the object was flying too close to the trees to be seen from the road itself, we ended up seeing nothing.  It was gone that quick.  As far as I know, no one ever reported sighting the object to the police or any other agencies in that area.  I checked several newspapers the following morning to see if anyone else had shared our bizarre experience.  Given the size, illumination and altitude of the hovering vehicle, it seems completely impossible to me that we were the only people to have witnessed this.  Even as I was glaring at the airborn object, I found it hard to believe that traffic along 14 mile and Campbell didn't come to a complete standstill when this thing came into view.  Save for the indifference of surrounding citizens, it looked like an incredible effects shot of an extra terrestrial visitor in a blockbuster film like ""Independance Day"".  I have never seen this craft again and I also have never seen it photographed or even sketched once during all the time I've spent reviewing popular U.F.O sighting since.

A large dark, cylindrical air craft with boxed lights, contained within a seemingly corrugated surface hovered above the treeline of the west side of Campbell rd. at it's intersection with 14 mile rd.  The boxed lights ran along the circumferance of the object and did not move.  They were extraordinarily bright.  The object stopped and hovered in place once it reached the busy street and then slowly hovered south along Campbell rd.  The craft appeared to be about 30 feet above the rooftops of the residences within the neighborhood.  From our perspective which was directly across the street in the Foodland parking lot, the air craft appeared to be the lenght of 4 or 5 of the houses it was hovering above.  After having viewed the strange ship for about 5 minutes, it was no longer within our field of view.  About 3 or 4 minutes later, my father exited Foodland and we attempted to pursue the craft by driving south down Campbell, the same direction it was slowly hovering in.  It was no longer visible in any direction at that point however.  It was as if it had simply vanished.  The ship made no noise that was audible beyond the general hum of the Campbell rd. traffic below it.  It's cylindrical shape was easily discernable given that the sky was a violet color that night.

I have been looking for cases similar to this and didn't have any luck until I found your reporting site due to reading an AP article.  Your site has several listings that are very close to this and it is interesting that no one seems to have a clue what it is.  

The following description was originally posted on my own website (www.danafrostick.com) about 4 years after the event occurance and was updated as noted on 3/22/2002:  ufo in breckenridge, texas?  

On the night of a full lunar eclipse in the autumn of 1996, my future husband and I were stopped at a small roadside motel for a rest in our Southwestern journey. We enjoyed dinner and went to our room. We had been able to watch the progress of the lunar eclipse as we ate our food and we were anxious to get the binoculars out to watch its culmination from the parking lot.

 The parking lot was adequately lit for security, but it didn't diminish the light from the full moon as it gradually went a bloody brownish color. The motel itself was the only establishment on the road for at least a mile or so. There was nothing on either side of the hotel or the other side of the highway except desert.

 We were leaning against our rental convertible, passing the binoculars back and forth as the moment of full eclipse approached. Only the thinnist sliver of reflected light was left showing as we both appreciated this natural phenomenom above the roof of the adjoining motel rooms.

 Suddenly, motion just below the moon caught my eye. I turned my head to the right to follow it and briefly saw the object as it flew off at a disturbing speed. What I saw doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard described before. Likewise, my husbands's description is unique, but only shares a few similarities with what I saw.

 We both saw something, because, I turned and looked at him and he said, ""Did you see that?""  My description:  The first view I had was only a glimpse of motion. When I turned my head I saw for just an instant what can only be described as a net of dim stars. It was a loosely structured object with a network of greyish ""lines"" which were actually various series of points. This grid structure was moving in all directions at once in an undulating fashion. It reminded me of watching a fisherman's net being tossed around in the waves, or an amoeba floating around on a speciman slide.

 Even though it didn't seem to have a method of propulsion, it was flying too fast for my eyes to follow it as it crossed the highway and headed out into the desert night.

 My husband's description:  He only got one glimpse of it as it passed underneath the moon. He saw what he called a gigantic skeletal bird, flapping its wings.

 At first, this doesn't sound like it could be the same object I saw. But, it is similar in that large sections of the object were moving, and that there was not much mass to the object, but a lot of empty space in it.

 Skeptics answer:  This was obviously a flock of birds flying low over the hotel. Even though I've never seen birds fly so fast that I couldn't keep up with them visually for at least 3 or 4 seconds. And, there was absolutely no sound.

 Then it must have been some piece of debris flying in the wind. Even though it was a still and completely cloudless night.

 Written: 9/25/00   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Updated: 3/2/2002 I was watching a show on TV last month, called ""You've Got To See It To Believe It,"" and I saw this really weird piece about something people are calling rods. It really freaked me out because it reminded me of the description that Richard gave of this incident. I went online and sluthed out a website about the rods called www.roswellrods.com and showed it to him when he came home. He told me that the rods looked like the object he saw that night in Breckenridge. They really do look real, but I can't convince myself that they actually exist. I'm thinking about setting up a video camera and maybe even a digital camera and doing some skyfishing on my own.

It seemed to turn inside it's self and back out then it emitted a red beam.

First of all I am an educated women, so is my partner and our friends.  Some of us were non-believers and some were.  While, some of us were frightened, some thought it was cool.  We are just ordinary people that saw something extraordinary.  Our age range is 18-58 and we come from many different racial, ethnic and financial backgrounds with an array of sexual orientations.

 I was driving home from a meeting about 10:10 pm and my partner said what was that white streak that just passed over the car.  I said what streak.  I did not see anything.  I said it must be a falling star.  She said ok but I do not think so and she made a wish.  We approached the house and we saw a white solid but with weird halo like object moving in front of us in the sky. 

 As we pulled into the driveway, we notice it was moving to the right of us.  It was moving east towards the direction of NYC.  After we parked the car and started to walk to the side of the house, we could see just a small portion of the white flat oval shape hovering between the treetops.

We proceeded into the house.

 My partner had to go to the bathroom and I said I am going to go to the bedroom and look out the window.  We live in a two-story duplex.  We are floor two and three so we have a pretty good view of the top of tree tops. 

When I went to the window, I got excited and called for my partner to hurry up in the bathroom; the object is outside our window.  She came running in the room with her pants half pulled up and said oh, ((deleted)) it is a UFO.  I ran to the closet and grabbed my binoculars.  

When I look thru the binoculars, I could she the define white flat oval shape object moving back and fourth, moving and stopping on the drop of a dime.  It also had blue/white, white/purple and white/red lights at the top and middle of the object.  My partner grabs the binoculars and saw the same thing.

 We were so excited and she started calling people.  She called her sister but she was not home.  She then called her job and the night crew was just getting off.  She said, ""there is a ((deleted)) UFO at my house get on the roof and see if you can see it.  There are also helicopters and planes flying around it as well.  Look in the direction of NYC and you should see it.""  

In about 3 mins. She called again, ""Did you see it,  No, and then come to my house. You have to see this.  Come now.""  

She then called our friend and she said she was shopping at the food store but she would be there shortly.  It had been floating, hovering, changing shapes and just moving around for 20 mins now.  We kept asking the object to stay just long enough for our friends to see it.  Every time we asked it to come back form behind the trees, it did.

 At this point, I went upstairs to our daughter's room to get a different view.  I could see it better from here.  I could tell this was not blimp or plane.  Then I started to chant a Buddhist mantra and the object got closer and began to change shape.  It seemed to turn inside it's self and back out then it emitted a red beam.  It was unbelievable.  My partner was still at the bedroom window down stairs, she was also doing the Buddhist mantra and saw the beam as well.  We both yelled to each other did you see that.  It was incredible.

 At this point, our friends arrived.  It was about 11pm.  Everyone ran to a window, upstairs or down stairs and could not believe their eyes.  They took turns trying to figure out what it was but nothing man-made made sense.  We watched it for another 25mins then it went behind a tree and did not come back.  We could still she the other aircrafts flying around the object but not quite approaching it.  By the time our friend that was shopping made to our house. It was gone.

This is a official close encounter of the third or forth kind. I am risking everything writing this and have nothing to gain since I do not need the attention.

Aliens do exist and I have seen them, matter of fact I have been 2 feet from them. The recent controversy over whether night terrors cause people to continue dreaming  after awakening from a night terror needs to be restudied. 

On March 14, 2003 I began to have what is known as a night terror (These started after a head injury in 1994). I have never been able to fully awake during a night terror except for 03-14-03. 

Sometime in the early morning I started having a night terror as I partial awoke I saw two small black figures enter my bedroom at that point I started to freak out and was yelling at myself to wake up, wake up, wake up and then I awoke. 

The two small black objects were two small grey aliens, once awoke I no longer was freaking out. I looked directly at these two aliens they observed me for about three seconds and then went running down my hallway at what appeared to be around 50 or 60 mph, their was an amber light being emitted down my hallway and the aliens ran into the light and disappeared.  I jumped out of bed ran down the hallway unlocked the door that was 4 feet from the end of the hallway and ran outside, there was nothing but dead calm.  There was an highly unusual calmness in the air and physiologically.  I was the calmest and most relaxed that I have ever experienced in my life (No pain killer or muscle relaxent has ever put me in this state).  

To this day I look at this experience as the coolest dream that I've ever had. I don't feel crazy because i know the truth and we are not alone and this was not like the other night terrors that I have had where I wake up with a racing heart rate. 

I went back to sleep after this occured which is highly unusual. I have an idea of what is going on and they are the creators of life, they put life on this planet to evolve and us stupid humans have poisoned the entire food chain which has inadvertantly poisoned us and now they are trying to save whats left as well as to protect us from possible other alien colonies.

Here's a play by play of exactly what has transpired.

 I'm an American living in Brazil with my girlfriend of 5 years. About three months ago I was driving back with her from the town where she grew up in Brazil. We were conversing, passing time, and she happened to tell me this story about how she and her sister used to expell metal pieces out of their mouths when they were kids. I was nodding my head and acknowledging her, but inside my head my thoughts could frankly be described as, 'mmhmm, oky doky', like 'yeah, sure, I'll just forget my girlfriend ever mentioned this crazy story'. She continued to say that her mother had the last piece extracted analyzed in a lab and the results were that the object was not ""from this world"". I naturally probed with a few questions, but I wasn't convinced so I honestly let the story in one ear and out the other because the mother or sister wasn't there to back the story and I need proof to believe something like this.

 Friday August 4th, 2005 - The Proof  My girlfriend decides to come home for lunch, a rare occasion. I made her a sandwhich, she ate, then had to rush back to the hospital (she's a doctor). She went into the bathroom to brush her teeth and I remained on the couch with our dog. All of the sudden she came out holding her finger out at me with a gold piece on it and said, ""Remember when I told you me and my sister were getting these metal pieces out of our mouths? Well, here's one"" (very calmly and confidently). She came out and showed me this thing like this wasn't the first time she's shown someone else these objects and she handed it to me and told me to keep it. She also had this air about her like, ""You believe me now?"".

 So I inspected it. I was really curious. I asked her if it had come off her necklace and she said, ""C'mon (my name), no"". Then I made her swear on my grandmother's soul that she wasn't lying and she did. My grandparents who are diseased mean the world to me and she knows it. Then I started thinking, was it in the bread, egg, salt, onion, tomato, cheese, ketchup, or lettuce that I made her? Was it in the grape juice she drank? How about the toothpaste? So I went into the bathroom and pointed out the toothpaste tube we'd been using and asked her if this was the toothpaste she'd used and she confirmed it was the one. So I squeazed the remains out on the bathroom counter and mushed it around with my finger to see if there were any more chips, no chips.

 Then she left, she had to get back. I got curious having this thing in my possession and wanted to check online to see if anyone else has had this same strange phenomenon happening to them. I wasn't having any luck. I started putting in on Yahoo, ""coughing up metal"", etc. I was clicking around with no luck until I happened upon this website, reading this story.

 http://www.ufoinfo.com/filer/2000/ff_0003.shtml  ""STRANGE GOLD IMPLANT FOUND Bill Bean writes that, ""In July of 1997, I became mysteriously ill and couldn't swallow, because there was a pressure on my throat."" I felt I was choking, just drinking water. It was the most horrible experience of my life, and I wish it on no one. I saw eight different doctors and many tests were done and nobody gave me an answers. I was rushed by ambulance to the hospital, three times in three weeks. I truly thought I was dying. I noticed a pattern of red circular marks on my back that I felt was a reaction to the medication. My wife photographed them. I could not eat and my weight went from a muscular 240 lbs. to 198 lbs. On December 16, 1997, I was in the bathroom with my wife, brushing my teeth when felt a bristle came off my toothbrush causing me to cough. I reached in my mouth to get the object with my right index finger and found a gold - square - flat - chip. Our first thoughts were that it had to come out of the toothbrush. Something told me to save it and I did. The next night, while brushing my teeth, I started coughing again and expelled two more of these things in the sink. After expelling the first piece, I felt like some pressure had come off of my throat and the next night a lot of pressure had come off. I began eating normally and felt much better. Last year, I sent one piece to Derrel Sims who had the object analyzed. Bill says, ""My piece matches a piece that was surgically removed from a person four years ago in Brazil. An isotopic test to determine if the piece is alien is being accomplished."" Thanks to Bill Bean bllin@erols.com. Editors Note: Derrel Sims and I feel this may be the most significant implant case thus far. derrel@holman.net""   When I read that line, ""On December 16, 1997, I was in the bathroom with my wife, brushing my teeth when felt a bristle came off my toothbrush causing me to cough. I reached in my mouth to get the object with my right index finger and found a gold - square - flat - chip."", a surge of fear shot right through me. I felt like I was in a movie suddenly or a bad dream. How could this all be some weird coincidence? It's possible sure, but I have a hard time formulating a hypothesis. Is some company having a food processing flaw allowing 20 some odd chips to fall into vats over the years and these three people in different countries happen to consume?   There are so many possibilities! Could it be the government somehow tracking people? Why the two sisters? Why the man, if he's telling the truth? Could extraterrestrials be abducting and experimenting on us? My girlfriend, seems to think they are coming from her nasal passage, not travelling up her esophagous and surfacing in the throat. Or perhaps if it is a food consumption flaw perhaps it's getting caught in the back of the throat in the tonsuls or skin. In 2002 after she extracted a chip, she moved with me shortly after to the US in 2003. Coincidently, she had a bad nasal infection and smell emminating from her nose.

  Another oddity related to this: both sisters have a benign cyst in the same location in the cerebellum in their brains. My girlfriend two months ago was feeling immense migraines and motor skill loss, so we went a diagnostics center here in Brazil to have an MRI done. I saw her holding up the large X-Ray looking sheets into the light and she said, ""Weird, I have the same cyst as my sister and in the same spot"".

  Immediately after I read that similar story online, what did I rashly do in a panic? I called SETI. I got their secretary in California and she couldn't help me, all she said was that she was sorry, but she didn't know where to guide me in this appologetic voice. Then she advised me that my girlfriend should see a doctor. I told her, ""the person who is expelling these is a doctor"". And she didn't have anything to say, but that she didn't know how to help me.

  That's when I started emailing as many UFO researchers as I could. Everyone seemed to refer me to A.J. Gaevard here in Brazil. So I contacted Mr. Gaevard and he was very nice and helpful and directed me to someone here close to home.

 What I do know is that when the mother of the two sisters had the piece in 2002 analyzed, from what I gather, they basically took it, said it was not from this planet, and didn't give it back and the family didn't hear anything back. So the girls weren't extracting anymore chips and the issue subsided and nobody talked about it, until now. I had my girlfriend call her mother in front of me and ask what happened exactly to the last chip. So her mother called her contact and this is what her mother explained to my girlfriend, who explained to me: The first lab didn't know what it was or what it was made of, so they sent it to another lab where they said it was somehow composed of quartz. That's it. And it took three years later for the mother to find this out in 2005.

 Update: We have since remained in contact with A.J. Gevaerd and his close friend and colleague who is an esteemed doctor and publisher, which we met in person last Monday (8/29/05) to drop the chip off for analysis. They are conducting research on the piece now. Results will be posted in Gevaerd's magazine sometime in the near future.

I was on the road delivering food for our rest., it was around six (dusk), the sky was a bright pink color here in florida; 

when something in the sky caught my peripheal vision.  I looked out the front window and noticed something in the sky reflecting light off its craft.  The UFO looked like a horizontal fat ellipse.  It was prety big for how high up it was, Looked like it was at jetliner cruising altitude. 

I felt that it knew it had been seen, i looked down at the road for a second then back up and it was gone.  no trace and nothing left in the sky. I scanned and scanned the sky trying to see if maybe it just moved, but it was gone. 

I drove for 5 minutes while still studying the sky, but with no avail. of seeing it anywhere.  I gave the people their food and took one last look west into the sky and there was no ufo, but there was a jetliner moving south to north heading into the same area the UFO was at minutes earlier. 

I watched and as the plane passed, i clearly noted that the commercial 7?7 was 2-3 times smaller than the UFO at about the same altitude and the jetliner left a condensation trail, UFO didn't.  

I have eagle vision, I've grown up on many air force bases to know what jet and choppers look like, also seen many launches from kennedy space center to know what a rocket looks like.  This was none except a UFO!!!

I have studied metaphysic's all my adult life. Have been involved with meditation's and various Shamanic work also.  I see this experience as spiritual in nature.  As natural as any other. I also feel honored to have had this experience.

I had been on a raw food only diet for a week, no alcohol, no medications, etc. and for the past three day's before the sighting had attended a seminar which had a profound affect on my consciousness. A few hours before the sighting, at the end of the seminar, something happened to my awareness. This must be explained in detail to make sense. I am willing to do that if need be.

Anyway I was in an amazing state of bliss. It was something I had never experienced. As I returned home at dusk, after the seminar's completion, I went up to my apartment in Newport Beach, California. As I walked into my place a voice said softly in my ear, ""Go out to the balcony""(second floor). It was not strange to hear this voice in the state that I was in and I slid open the door and went out. The sun had gone down and immediately off to my far right was a ship slowly moving in my direction. John Wayne airport is off in the distance and I remember even seeing, as is the case regularly, a distant plane flying out. I knew immediately this was no airplane, jet or anything else I had ever seen. And it was so close.

The ship's details were not clear because it was getting towards dark and the light was not hitting it in front of me. As it moved at about 10-20 mph from a quarter mile away at my right to directly in front of me it was between 500 and 1000 feet from me...right over the parking garage next to my complex.

It stopped right in front of me...as if to say hello (that's the feeling I had).  And within 10 seconds of stopping flew off at a 45 degree angle upwards at incomprehensible speed.  It was gone from view in 2 seconds.

When the ship was stopped in front of me...I looked down breifly and there were the usual people walking in and out of the large apartment complex but none of them were noticing this craft.  My estimation was it was the size of a football field.  It was circular with noticeable, but undefined, multi-levelled sides.  There were also dim auburn colored lights at a few places on it's side.  Or this may have been the after-sunset reflection.

This is the only time I have seen a UFO.  I believe my ability to witness this craft was because of my raised level of consciousness(via an intense seminar, etc). My theory being ""I met them halfway"".

I was driving the short 5 mile (10 minutes) journey back to my home through very rural English countryside after a small christmas night gathering of friends and had consumed no alcoholic drink or food during this day or evening.

I have good eyesight and am an Engineer by trade who's worked in various military lighting fields with private flying experience and am an observer by nature.

Being christmas day evening the roads where very quiet with almost no traffic at all when i noticed what i assumed to be a very bright large twinkling stationary star emitting green and blue light in my 11 o`clock high position while driving.

This was the only visible light in the sky and by my judgement a very bright star compared to the normal countryside night sky we have around here but on looking around i could not see any other stars or aircraft navigation lights or anti/coll strobes to compare this Light/star with in my 180 degree arc of view 

This very bright star remained visible to me for approximately two to three minutes and then completely disappeared in a millisecond as i closed distance on it 

The sky was a cloudy night and my guess is with a high cloud base of 2000 feet and the wind speed at ground level almost zero 

I arrived back in my driveway at home in less than two minutes after this star disappeared and the one thing that struck me as i closed my gates while gazing at the spot in the sky was how quiet everything was, no cars or people out and about, wind or weather noise's, aircraft movements or sound's in general, a very quiet evening with almost the best chance possible of not being seen, stange huh?","Engineer",0,0,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2005,2000,4,12,21,"Evening",NA,1,0,0,0,0

time of sighting is an estimate. I saw a roundish object in the sky as I was entering a grocery store on Black Rock Turnpike. I stopped breifly to look at it longer. It looked as if it was rotating. it was either bright white or of reflective material. I would also estimate it's size to be about the same as a small plane. OTHER INFO: I'm pretty sure that this was the same object I had seen in this sky before. I was eating at a fast food place on the same street about a block away. I was able to monitor the object with my naked eyes for the duration of it's visibility. also in that sighting, it traveled slowly, stopped, changed direction then dissapeared. I am unable to tell you what day it was but it may have been early spring 2005 or 2004. I remember it was cold out.

About me. I tend to be very observant. I spotted a cockrach at 20 feet while driving through D.C. if that makes sense to you. I always keep an eye open for something out of the ordinary. I am also a skeptic and look for possible explanations. this may have been a silver mylar party balloon and it was twirling up in the sky. but I think it was too big to be that. party ballons are 18"" and this was much larger.

I can't quite remember if it had a haze around it. I was hoping someone else spotted this thing, it was a busy afternoon.

Around midnight I started to get hungry and went out for food. The only places open at that time here are Taco Bell, Whataburger, and Wendy's.  Given my choices I went to Wendy's.

 After goin thru the drive thru I stopped in the parking lot to put the straw in my drink. before I started again I checked down the road and saw several lights in the air.  I was about two miles from Dyess AFB at the time and thought it was a plane landing,  

then I noticed the lights were all blinking and the pattern did not fit any aircraft I know of. They were all a very pure white color, I couldn't see any yellowing or blueing like aircraft or car lights. 

I started watching it and saw the light reflecting off some trees under it, it appeared to be apporx. 15 feet off the treetops which were maybe 150 yards away from me. 

After about 15 seconds of watching them blink they ""slid"" over to the SE about 100 yards  I estimate. the movement took a full 2 seconds. 

There was no acceleration or deceleration, it moved and stopped. 

After stopping it hovered and all lights went steady for a few seconds then all shut off at the same time. After they turned off I watched for a few more seconds to make sure they didn't come back then drove off.","Military",1,1,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2006,2000,1,1,0,"Night","South",1,0,0,0,0

My daughter and I were going to the KFC to pick up food.  We were traveling down Leicester Hwy and saw a red ball of light.  It was in the western sky.  We pulled over to the Ingles parking lot and called my wife on the cell phone to look outside from our house and see if she could see it.  By this time approx. 18 cars pulled in around me to look at the object.  None of us could figure it out.  The light would move up and down left and right slowly.  My wife grabed our dogs and got in the car headed for us.  She said the dogs started wailing like they were hurting.

When she got to us the dogs would not come out of the car and huddled in the floor board.  When we tryed to pick them up they were stiff, as if they were scared.

More people including 2 Asheville Police cars pulled into the Ingles parking lot to view the object.  It evently drifted South West, came off and on slowly, then just dissapeared. We watched the local WLOS news and a proffesor from UNCA said it could be a planet.  But planets don't move.

I was leaving the Grand Union food store after sunset and I noticed 20 or so people in the parking lot were looking into the western sky.  

On the horizon around 30 degrees and slightly southwest I saw a formation of copper/gold lights shaped like a pentagon with one in the center.  They moved from various points then merged and became one large light in the center.

You are looking at covert military aircraft.  If they're UFO's, then where's the press?  Where's the miltary reports/logs on those escorted flights?  The answers come in 2 words: National Security   Maybe the reason why the sightings are so visible and frequent, is because some info on these aircraft will be released to the public over the next decade.   Did everyone know about the U2 or the SR-71 when it was in development?   Wake up you lost little lambs.  

Personally, I believe if any of this crap was actual extra-terrestrial in nature...then our existence could only be reduced to a cultivated food product for a distant alien society.   And most of us would have already been on the chopping block.

""People of Earth; unite and love each other""  Then I looked at my son and he at me and we repeated the message verbatum.  After that, we looked back towards the ship and it was gone.  We were not scared by this experiencce, we just went home to eat.

That night as everyoone slept, I looked up at the sky and saw hundreds of lights with strange movements, and some that traveled in threes.  It was reported in the local newspaper that 10,000 sightings were reported that night.

Of course that night absolutely nobody in my neighboorhood or surrounding neighborhoods had any electricity at all. Most of Dade and Broward counties we pretty much pitch black. I don't even think anyone in our near by neighborhoods had any generators until at least 1-2 days later or so, and  our area alone went about 2-3 weeks without electricity. That night my 10yr old brother, my mother and I were outside our house in the porch area. We were grilling some food and pulled some chairs out. We were looking up at the skies and really just admiring the stars and how beautiful it looked since you can't really see & appreciate them in the city. It was really, really dark and had a perfect view of the skies. We were just staring up a few minutes when my mom said look at that star it's moving. All the other stars in the skies looked normal and in place except this one that was actually moving. We could not see a shape or outline of any sort. I couldn't say that it looked like a saucer or diamond or anything it just simply looked like a moving star unlike the others. Just a bright light but not abnormally bright and it looked very, very far up in the sky. Of course the three of us just looked at it and followed it's movement as it was heading north. We were mesmerized and couldn't take our eyes off of it we kept saying it can't be a plane because to our knowledge their were no planes flying that night due to the hurricane. And it just seemed so far up I've never seen a plane fly that far up before. Then we noticed another moving star behind the first one almost like out of nowhere so here there was two moving stars that seemed to be flying pretty fast and not necessarily in a ""perfect line"". I'm not going to say it was doing any crazy twists and turns or anything like that either just not a perfect line and a plane couldn't make those fast movements. My mom and I just kept saying it can't be a plane besides there are no planes flying tonight. We kept asking what is that? Do stars move like that?   And if so why are these the only 2 stars moving like this and the others are standing still? My brother kept asking me is that a UFO? We followed it for a good 5+ minutes eventually when it got past a certain distance we couldn't see past our roof and lost it. But right when we thought we lost it almost immediately after that over our roof we saw what looked like a shooting star. I don't know much about shooting stars or anything like that but whenever I've seen a shooting star or seen it portrayed usually it seems to shoot downward and this shot upwards and it was brighter then anyone I've ever seen and almost in a line not ""arched"". That could've just been a coincidence I don't know about that I just thought the timing was either weird or perfect. We just kept looking up and kept asking ourselves what was that? Did we just see a UFO? Then when we thought the action was over we continued to look around and I noticed another moving star this one was brither and bigger then other two but it couldn't be the same one because the other two had just past over going north this one was just approaching us and it was on the west side there was no way it could've turned around that quickly in a matter of a minute! I said look  another one up there,my brother asked where?I pointed at it, as I said it was approaching us and this one didn't look as high up as the other two. He still  couldn't find it. I told him give me your flashlight. We had one of those long black flash lights like the kind cops use a good bright one  nearby he got it and gave it to me. I turned it on and said see look up there and pointed the lit flash light in the direction of the star. As soon as I turned on the light and pointed in it's direction the star dimmed it's lights!It just looked like one of those really dim stars but you could still see it  moving, and he said why did you point at it, it must've seen you! Now it's going to come after us and he actually got scared. Shortly after it dimmed it's lights it disappeared behind a cloud. This one we only saw about 2-3 minutes. We waited for it to come out the other end of the small cloud but it never came out. And how weird was it that it immediately dimmed it's lights when I pointed my flash light in it's direction. My brother kept asking what if it comes back later tonight? Do you think it saw us? He was actually scared and we just told him that if it was a UFO it was gone now. We stayed looking up for another 15 minutes to see if anything else would happen but that was it we didn't see anything else. My mom's friend claims that she saw the moving stars also that night. I actually went out the rest of that week every night with my little brother for a couple of hours a night to see if we saw anything else but we never did.I was not scared I don't know if mom was she didn't say so. I was more intrigued and mesmerized then anything and I do believe I saw a ""UFO"" and I'll never forget that experience. I don't think my little brother ever will either. He was scared but intrigued also and is now all into UFO stuff which is how we found this site surfing the net.  We still talk about it of course, my dad laughed it off didn't take us seriously and my husband just said that's great honey. But the three of us know what we saw and it was not ""normal""  it was amazing there was something out there.

On my way from my car to a restaurant, a fixed bright white light in the eastern sky(just like a star) caught my eye, I thought it was odd because the sky was very bright blue,  so i pointed it out to my two friends whom i was going to lunch with.

As we were looking at it i realized that there was two more coming into view on the right of it, it was clear that they were very high up because there were some small and thin patches of clouds passing in front of them (but not obstructing them).As i turn to speak to my friends (and two other people who were passing by Since we were standing in a parking lot of a this shoping center) about how the first light was getting brighter and closer while moving to our right, looking up again, i realized to my amazment that at least 30 more appeared from the east moving in unison to the south west (they also moved in random among each other while changing colors, they were mostly luminous white but at time some will appear black or goldish orange color). While looking and pointing excitedly at the all these dots of lights, i also noticed an airplan crossing in front of these group of lights,it appeared to be high enough that one could not discern the kind of plan it was except that it was metalic.

At this point, about ten minuts past since i first notice the first light, my neck and my eyes were strained and i had to go into the restaurant (because the lunch buffet was closing at 3pm, which was in a few more minuts). After serving and placing my food on the table, i went back out and notice that the original light was still moving slowly to my right away from the group and was relatively about five times larger and brighter than the other lights. After a minute or two, it appeared to stop moving, and again i had to go back into the restaurant, figuring, that i will finish my lunch and go back to keep track at these strange light formation, but about five minuts later when i was out again, there was nothing in the sky other than the usual low flying private plans.

I woke up to the sound of my mom leaving the house; I rolled over and went back to sleep.  That's when they entered my dream and proceeded to use it to connect with me telepathically.  The first thing I experienced was seeing one of these aliens (I had been guided telepathically by another one of his kind before this on a pretty regular basis).  I can't really pinpoint what triggers my encounters, but they always help me to do what I need to do to help them.  At first, I thought that I was just dreaming, until I was overcome with an intense feeling of this dream no longer being my own; it was my guide watching me from DIRECTLY above me, taking control of my dream, telepathically telling me that this was, beyond ANY doubt, NOT a dream!  This alarmed me, but it didn't terrify me.  I remember seeing other people, just shadows now as I try to recall their appearances, on this elevator that they had produced for me to see, it being a means of transporting me from my room to their ship.  I knew they were doing this; I was aware of it. But they put me in the frame of mind I needed in order for me to do my job by scaring me for the reason of my becoming submissive as a result of my fear.  Only when I was submissive (apparently (They know this about me!)) would I be able to comply with their requests in order for me to fulfill my duties.  They scared me by means of hearing the engine of the ship gearing up to leave.  Frankly, it mortified me, because the noise seemed to come alive by means of a tingling light that penetrated not only the elevator, but also passed through me front to back.  The tighter I shut my eyes, the more details of my surroundings I could see because the light that this noise produced got so bright that had my eyes been opened, I would have been blinded by the brightness.  With my eyes closed, it was easier to see details of my surroundings!  But then they comforted me milliseconds before I woke up.  When I did wake up, my guide stepped back until he regained his telepathic link to me.  I was then magnetically drawn into the ship by the ship where I then proceeded to tend to my first order of business, which was to try on different visualizations of different types of hands, faces, arms, legs, and feet for the purpose of deciding what would look most human, but more importantly, what would be most practical for their purpose. I then entered a hospital-like area.  The whole level was a hospital. I somehow knew that this ship had multiple levels.  During this visit, I was only needed on this level.  My guide told me to go get something from one of the receptionists. I walked past the receptionists, surveyed the patients, saw some scary looking tubes and bags containing hybrid blood.  These bags were apparently organic in nature because they seemed to be alive, protecting, enhancing, and providing nutrients to the hybrid blood.  These tubes were true red, because upon going to work later that day, (I work at a fast food place,), I remember surveying the floor to see where it was dirty, seeing the red tape covering pipes leading to the soda machine, and becoming extremely and noticeably uneasy upon seeing this red tape.

While riding in the back seat of 2003 Hyundai Tiburon, my friends and I stopped at a light at the cross streets of College and Towne Center, heading Southbound. I leaned my head back to look at the sky, bored, while we were waiting for the light to change. The sky was clear blue, but my eyes immediately fixed onto an object. It was very high in the sky. I couldn't make out a shape, but it was reflecting light. It appeared stationary in the sky. I tried to determine if there was any movement at all. The light turned green and we rolled forward to the next cross street, Frazee Road. The light was green there so we rolled right on through. I never looked away. I could tell where we were because the road goes uphill from there and turns slightly to the left. I removed my ballcap and tried to keep an eye on the object. I didn't say anything to my friends because at this point, I was believing this to be one of those food store balloons you usually see at the register. I thought maybe a kid had lost one. Then I saw the object appear to reflect light in two spots, like maybe there was not one but two objects. Still, I thought, maybe they were two balloons tied together. The strange thing was, I couldn't really tell if the object drifted any. I wasn't in the best circumstance for viewing them, I realize, and they may have been just balloons, maybe even a weather balloon, but the thing that seemed off to me was that they did seem perfectly still in the sky. *shrugs* Posting it here just in case it was something more and someone else got a better view of it.

My friend and I were talking once we had food and shower laying in our sleeping bags among hundreds of other fire fighter in a field in Redmond, Oregon where fire jumpers are trained and laying flat on our backs I saw all the beautiful stars in the sky that were so clear and out in the open like it is in Eastern Oregon, right near Bend, Oregon I started to see an image among the stars.  My friend and I were talking and I don't remember talking for a bit because of the image I saw.  Directly above me I saw the shape of a triangle within the stars. It did not block the stars but blended in with the stars except the outside shape of the triangle moved seperately from the rest of the stars.  It made no noise and it was huge. When you think of what your peripheral visions space is it alsmost took it up.  I would say the object was about 80% to 85% of my full peripheral vision area.  I did not wear glasses at the time.  There was no red flashing lights but small light that looked no different than the stars.  It look right on top of us yet far.  It was so strange and so so remarkable at the same time. My eyes looked quickly from side to side looking at the object to make sure my eys were not deceiving me then I turned to my friend and said did you see that?  We both said it at the exact same time to each other and he said what did you see?  I said ""No, What did you see? You tell me first"" He saw the same thing, when we turned back to see it was gone that I know of. My friend moved on in our own seperate live and wished I could get in touch to talk about what we saw.

As we (my wife, kids and I) were heading back to our campsite we saw a ring of lights (10-12) in a circle, low flying above the lake.  We saw this in an opening in the trees for about 5 seconds.  I think I saw a small light next to it but it may have been a star. I stopped my truck as we both said what the - is that? As I stopped my truck we lost it through the trees.  I backed up but we could not locate it again. We both looked at each other and my wife said lets go to the trailer.  I backed up further (much further than original sighting) but could not locate the lights.  I decided to go to the RV.  I put the kids in the trailer and my wife went in to eat (we went out for food).  I stood outside and looked for the lights.  I felt strange, like I was sure I saw a ufo but like I didn't care enough to keep looking or something.  I heard and saw the ligths of several jets, the blinking lights of the jets illuminated the trees.  I'm sure they were jets and not large aircraft.  I went in the trailer and ate.  We heard more, or the same jets again and I said to my wife 'more jets'.  

My wife seemed uncomfortable with what she saw and didn't say anything.  Before seeing this we had heard several loud (strange) noises in the woods that sounded like an extremly large jackhammer.  They were brief, but loud and powerful, I've never heard anything like them.  I don't know if they were related but we did not hear the noises again after the sighting and we heard it at least 10 times between Friday night and Saturday before the sighting.","Retired police officer, full time dad",2,1,"circle",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2006,2000,4,11,18,"Evening","Northeast",1,0,0,0,0

I was working in the early morning at a fast food restaurant on Jungermann and Hwy 94. 

When taking out the trash, I noticed three shiny silver spheres in the sky in a perfect triangle formation.  They were not moving in any direction, just hovering, and slightly wobbling.  

I'm not good at distances, but I believe they were much lower than most commercial airplanes fly, maybe only a couple thousand feet in the air.

This morning is January 9th, 2007. Tuesday.  Went to work as usual except woke up with a lingering headache. This worked into feeling terrible like a bug had gotten me.  Was going to punch out right away but went to get coffee and waited to start feeling better.  I was parked sideways in the restaurants empty backlot staring into the sky towards our local Truck Assembly Plant.  There were some dim parking lot lights and some evergreens across the area.  The time was 7:35 or so and the Sun was not upvery high yet. Clear sky and stars.

There was only one overly bright star that caught my attention.

I looked again and stared. 20 degrees up and bright it was moving. As I looked into the SouthWest is was moving West to South straight across slowly for about 20 degrees  and stopped.

At this time I was glassy eyed and head pounding and was trying to decide how good it would feel to fly into bed under a foot of covers. Today was freezing and Windy.

I squinted and looked again. The light was still there and now bigger. It looked intense like when I saw Venus thru the planetarium telescope. It looked like there was activity in its brilliance. Like a fire or something molen which was changing as I watched it.

The was a thin horizontal line of calm thru the middle which the brilliance was around. As I watched the thing it grew bigger in roundness and brilliance. From the size of a large Michigan star to the size of three large stars. The light seemed to form a horizontal halo thru its center. It moved slightly back to the West and remained.

These things are all happening slowly. It has been three or four minutes so far. The brilliance stayed the same for about a full minute and I started looking around the sky. About 3 or 4 fingers South of this and the same distance below it was another smaller light and it was motionless for about five or ten seconds after I noticed it. It looked kind of like Mercury when you see it far down on the horizon only a little higher.  

My mind thought O.K. that really IS a star. O.K. now its moving- it is a plane. O.K. now it stopped right under the big one-which is going NOWHERE.---- At around this time I was wondering how this is happening and other things about this-like Good Explanations.  Maybe plane search lights-much bigger than normal-must be Police helicopters-no search light trail though.  No directional beam coming off it at all. If it was Police or Plant helicopters in the sky they hovered without motion way too long.  If it was aircraft and I was staring headlong into their searchlight the time was still way too long. The plane would've covered a few miles coming straight at me.

I began filtering thru many thoughts. Is this something I should notify about? Is it dangerous? Is anybody else seeing this? No-no one really looks up and it is still halfway dark out. Am I really seeing UFO's? Are they working with authorities or Who Care's. Could my head hurt anymore than this? The second light was not brilliant. It very definitely stopped right under the brilliant one-or-at least looked like it from my vantage point. This was a steady point of light which was staying-then-it moved slowly three fingers over to where it appeared right under the big one and stopped momentarily. It was ten or twenty seconds then faded off slowly.

The brilliant one was still flaring and now it looked like it sprang an arm of light out about half its diameter and a quarter of its diameter in width.Sticking right out at about one o'clock to me. I had to scratch my head and rellok at it. What the-what NOW? It stayed that way for about twenty seconds then in the space of about a second, from the nine o'clock point on it, split into two halves just enough to open like a ""Pac-Man"" mouth and again I could see a dark line forming thru the center of the diameter and disappear as the two halves closed up. As this was happening the whole light seemed to give a shudder or extra volume and brilliance then back to normal.

At that point it was motionless again and drifted slowly to a point behind a sparse evergreen limb where I couldn't see it.

I sat there thinking-should I pursue this? Can my head hurt anymore than this? I moved the van over about ten feet East and about twenty feet South and there was a light. It was holding steady and brilliant but smaller. There was now also an obvious small Cessna type plane in the area. It was far off in the distance. Maybe flying due South and climbing at a steep pitch because I remember thinking-wow-is he doing acrobatics? But right now? This early in the morning? The brilliant one was still there but small-seemed like holding there again. I put the van in gear and took off out of the parking lot towards the highway (I-75). In the right lane the paved shoulder stops there and traffic at the red light got me stuck. I looked and looked there but nothing left. I could barely hold my head up off the steering wheel. The time was 7:58 AM. Waited for traffic to clear and the one guy stopped behind me to pull around then drove into the fast food place right there and got coffee. After driving the mile back to work I paged my boss and punched out on the time clock.

As I look back on this event of about six hours ago it is my feeling the lights were less than a mile away which would put them right over the Plant or Hotel next door. Everything written down in this report is my best recollection, albeit my flu bug and sinus headache. I work on an outside crew and look at the stars alot in the early morning but have never experienced this kind of thing before. In the aftermath of this I had that feeling of a Cheshire Cat grin like you just got lucky enough to experience something few people do. That feeling was intense for several days","Municiple Employee",1,2,"sphere",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2007,2000,1,1,7,"Morning","Midwest",1,0,0,0,0

Story:  This is one of the most ironic and amazing stories I have even heard of.  It demonstrates the very reasons I have not reported events to UFO center sites,  besides the fact that I would want to do illustrations and 3D simulations to show .

In 1992 NASA?s HRMS, High Resolution Microwave Survey, is launched at Goldstone Observatory outside Barstow, California and at the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico.  As I had a colleague doing art for them and was soon to be working with SETI and was also involved with NASA and the other astronomical organizations I was able to get my wife ((name deleted)) and myself invited to the Barstow event and the Goldstone ceremony.  I knew a few people there and a few astronomers I had worked with as well as a couple artist friends.  I felt an outsider most of the time not being able to afford the dinners and hotel events.  I borrowed a friends 8mm video camera and had my own SLR and lots of film, so spent most my time shooting the event.  I was able to meet Carl Sagan and was able to shake his hand and thank him personally for his work in educating myself and the public so beautifully with the PBS Cosmos series.  Just a few minuets with him though.

We where bused into Goldstone on the military base for the ceremony where I shot film and video of all I could.  We had a great time participating in the historic event and got photos of Carl, friends and other dignitaries.   It was a good event and history in the making.  When it was over we just wanted to go relax somewhere.

As was our tradition at the time, when we are down that far south we always try go through or stay a night in Death Valley, a favorite place to this day, having spent much time there hiking and camping as well as exploring through college and after.  My wife and I spent two weeks just below the monument for our honeymoon in 1980 and I had done several road trips and backpacking high in the mountains in the seventies.  So we where very comfortable in this desolate beauty and powerful nature spot.

We arrived in the monument from our Barstow hotel in the late afternoon.  Not wanting to miss a shot at a sunset session there, we went to the sand dunes directly, grabbed our day-packs and photographic bags and a borrowed Hi8 video cam and ran (walked fast) out to the deep dunes.

As we walked, my wife and I where having an argument probably due to our depleted neurochemistry from erratic sleep, road-food and stress.  As we stood 10 feet apart and speaking loudly at each other, about nothing I remember, all of a sudden a bright light in the sky over ((deleted--wife)) drew my attention.  I was facing mountain Tucki Mountain looking south across the Panamint Mt. range  The range was had mountains as high as up to 11000ft.   This Tucki Mt. was over 5000 ft. I know because by that time in my life I had climbed Telescope Peak there (11049 ft.) in 1976 and had hiked the valley many times, so was familiar with the distances and geography first hand.

As I looked at the light I noticed it was like a super bright flare slowly arching down from what looked like a massive black triangle 70% oblique to me.  I estimated it was close to the mountains and probably we where at or below sea level, observed the object at about 4000ft I estimated.  I yelled at my wife to look!, thinking she missed the ""spark,"" but as she turned, another bright spark came out of the craft and flew slowly down and out.  What we where left with was a view of this seemingly football-field sized or larger black triangular shape with what I remember was maybe many colored lights on what looked like the leading edge.  It was moving slowly, silently and deliberately northward along the range.

 By that time it was dusk heading for twilight and the light was going.  I had film with ASA rated for daylight but attempted to get a shot after a few minuets of checking ourselves and confirming we where seeing the same thing.  I could not get any exposure, shot some blanks on the off chance they would show, but no luck.  The Hi8mm cam I had could not even show an image it was so dark.  In retrospect I could have narrated a detailed description on video.  I did not think over the ontological terror of seeing such a thing at the time.

 So we stood in the sand dunes for about 20-30 minuets watching as the object slowly moving north along the mountain range until we lost sight of it in the extinction, haze and darkness.  Our legs where like rubber and we where very excited and a bit concerned for our safety as we thought we where totally alone in the vast valley.  So we made our way deliberately to our car parked a mile back through the dunes.  As we reached the parking area we noticed a motorcycle had come while we where gone and parked with its owner sleeping on top of one of the few picnic tables.  I was too spooked and in too much of a hurry to wake the person and ask him if he saw anything or warn him of the possible danger we felt.   We headed rapidly for the Stove Pipe Wells campgrounds with our heads rotating 360 for any other sights.

Later at home, I referenced topographic and standard maps of the area and noticed that just the other side of the range but several air miles south from Tucki Mountain was the military test range China Lake Navel Weapons Testing Range.   So the military is all over the place down there.

So although I had no visual record of the event we experienced, we had solid memory as you might imagine.   This is the first time I have written about this.  I have told some friends, but that is all.  I am producing a documentary segment for the event in 3D high resolution animations.  I also have a Google Earth KMZ file showing the site.  Much more research also on file.

So who would believe such a story?  An artist, a Sci-Fi fan and lifetime UFO interested person coming from a SETI event?  Not a chance.  I could have physical evidence and people would just laugh.  I would probably not blame them either.","Illustrator, Visual Producer",2,1,"triangle",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1992,1990,4,10,17,"Afternoon","West",1,0,0,1,0

2007/03/22: The first time I saw the object was about 19:30. I was standing by my car when I saw the light about 2 miles away. Then within a matter of seconds it was over my head moving towards the east. It was a bright amber sphere and was moving extremely fast without sound or without leaving a contrail. I tried to drive to keep it in my sight. By the time I had driven three blocks the object had moved about 15 miles eastward. I decided that it would be pointless to pursue any further since it had traveled so fast. After that I headed towards the northwest side of town where my friend lived. Just before arriving at his home, I saw the same object fly over me again at an incredible speed, this time toward the west. I called my friend since the object would soon fly over his home. My friend didn?t believe me thinking I was making a joke. There were three of us at my friend?s house, when about 21:30 I decided to make a food run. As I was driving I saw the same object again, but this time there were two objects one just above the other. I stopped my car to make sure that it wasn?t a perception problem. I called my friend and immediately drove toward his home again. The three of us saw the objects slowly move, stop, hover, and move again. The movements of the objects were very erratic and they moved independently from one another. One friend, that was watching these objects with me, was in the navy and worked as an aircraft identifier on a carrier ship. He said that there was nothing to his knowledge that would exhibit that kind of movement and fly that close together. We watched these objects as they slowly moved across the sky. After about five minutes, they started blinking and then just vanished.

Okay, this is a strange story but rather funny and I just have to share it. I'm not positive about the exact date or year. But it was the summer of 97 or 98. I was driving northbound to my office in Columbus, Ohio and stopped at my usual fast food place for breakfast. I pulled around the back of the building to the service window. As I stopped at the window I looked up and noticed straight in front of me but maybe a block or two away, a giant (30-40 feet tall)Teddy Bear floating in the sky right above the trees. I thought I was seeing things for a second then realized it must be a hot air balloon although where the basket would be was below the tree tops. It floated past the corner of the building I was next to so I couldn't see it any longer. I laughed and told the cashier what I saw when he waited on me. He stuck his head out the window but it was already out of sight. A few moments later he gave me my order and I drove forward. As I turned around the corner of the building I looked to where the object should be based on it's speed and direction. There was nothing there. Before I pulled back onto the main street I looked all around and up. It had disappeared. Because of the flatness of the area and lack of large trees or tall buildings the only way I could explain it disappearing was if it had crashed behind a home and lost it's air in the short time between when I saw it float past the building and when I pulled up. I listened to the local news that evening to hear if there had been a balloon crash or even a balloon show. Nothing was mentioned. As nutty as this sounds it really happened just as I wrote.

	I was with my boyfriend driving down the highway when I made a split decision to get off for some food at a fast-food restaurant. As I exited the highway, my boyfriend commented on what looked to be the only star in the sky, in both of our opinions. I immediately had a feeling he suspected a ufo for some weird reason, but had no idea what we were about to witness. As I came to the bottom of the ramp, I stopped for a moment and just watched as this flying craft came towards us. It seemed to have no steady path. It had incredibly bright white lights and immediately, in mid-air turned those lights off seconds after I stopped at the bottom of the ramp. As we watched, the craft, which was Absolutely Not an airplane, and didn?t appear to be a helicopter either, it dropped straight down about 250 feet in the air, hovered, and then started to rise again.

	I turned right at the stopligh t(at the bottom of the ramp) and then proceded to my restaurant.  My boyfriend told me within 20 seconds from leaving the bottom of the ramp that it was directly above my car.  It stayed above my car as I drove to the restaurant.  My boyfriend told me he looked straight up at it and it was just spinning fast.  It was only about 4-600 feet in the air above us. It looked in the beginning like it was going to land right before our eyes.  It appeared to have 3 little lights on it, one was red and the other two were yellow or white.  This was too low to be a helicopter or plane.  After placing my order I remarked to my boyfriend that I was going to ask someone if they had or could see this thing too! Just as quick as I said that and I pulled forward it was gone- not a trace in the sky. We had seen it from such a distance, but yet it disappeared in a split second. This all happened in just a few minutes.

Traveling back home by car from Key West (towards Miami) my husband and I saw a strange object in the sky ahead of us. We calculated its size to be anything from 15 feet in length, in a horizontal position.  It looked cylindrical in shape, with 'fins' at one end. It was a bright white color - perhaps reflecting the sun, against a clear blue sky. We didn't see any lights on it. As we drove further along our route, towards the object, we could see that it seemed to be in a static position approximately 500-1000 ft up, directly above what looked like a radio tower. There was no sound or motion observed at all, and eventually we left it behind - above the 'radio tower'. We could not see any tether, but we are left wondering whether this could have been a simple weather balloon or similar man-made device? If so, others may have reported seeing this same object there in the past. Unfortunately, , being at the end of our holiday trip, we had no film left in the camera to photograph it.

 Incidentally, we are both senior citizens, in good health both physically and mentally, and our backgrounds include the arts, sales/business, and health care/medicine. We are both still gainfully employed. We always try to keep an open mind about most things, and are particularly interested in health, nutrition, and holistic medicine.

In the late afternoon of Memorial Day 2006, I was visiting with a friend that resides in Jeffersonville, In located adjacent to Louisville, Ky across the Ohio river.  I reside in Louisville, and frequently visit said friend as we have a 20 plus year friendship.  The day was fairly mundane and customary of the visits- on this particular day we were having a cookout to celebrate the holiday.   My friends brother of which Im also closely acquainted,  had also arrived and was assisting us with preparing the food.

We were standing in a group in the patio area of my friends apartment, when for no particular reason I happened to glance upward facing East.  Immediately I viewed an object which was instantly unusual and atypical to me.  I called it to the attention of my friends.  For the next several minutes we observed this object in silence, then I suggested my friend go retrieve his binoculars.  Roughly 2 minutes later my friend appeared outside again with the binoculars and each of us in turn observed the object more closely through the binoculars.  This had the effect of enhancing the unusual nature of what we were witnessing.

The weather that day was partly cloudy with a storm approaching from the west.  We were each facing east where visibility was clear.  It was approximately 5:30 in the afternoon and the sky was a crisp blue where visible to the east.  A bank of thin clouds were immediately overhead.

The object we were viewing was a very stark black of perfectly square configuration.  The object had no surface features, no protrusions, no reflectivity and no oscillation.  The was no sound accompanying the object.  Upon first viewing the object it was roughly 25 degrees from the horizon and stationary.  As soon as I first viewed the object, it began ascending along a single vector straight upward at a very slow leisurely pace.  The object maintained it's relative configuration, size, speed of ascension, and color value the entire duration of the sighting and ascended until it dissapeared behind the above cloud bank.  With my arm outstretched the object would have been approximately the size of my forefinger nail.   As the object was against the backdrop of the sky there was no frame of reference to accurately determine distance or relative size of the object.   If I were to make a presumption based on my own depth perception of the objects spatial orientation it appeared to be closer rather than further, less than 2 miles away, making it roughly the size of an automobile.

The object was in clear view long enough for a discussion during the sighting on what it clearly was not.  An entire gambit of possible explanations was dismissed as we were all viewing the object.  The object was clearly not an aircraft of conventional configuration, balloon, parasail, garbage bag, insect, bird, toy, kite,  or illusory figment.   This was a tangible, solid object that possessed mass and weight.

I immediately contacted 911 and was instructed to contact New Albany or Jeffersonville police department, of which I did neither as the event was over and the object was no longer visible.   Additionally I contacted Louisville international airport and spoke with the radar operator.  The operator indicated there was nothing unusual in the sky over southern Indiana.

The event left me disturbed and confounded.   I have a background in Psychology and I am fully aware of the many mechanisms within the human mind that can create potential misinterpretations of visual stimuli.

The irony is while observing this object I distinctly recall all of these formal concepts raced through my mind it seemed,  and none of these were satisfactory to me.  Remotely.

It is one thing to read about unexplained aerial phenomenon over the years, but to actually witness something that defies frame of reference or educational background  is quite startling.  I consider myself a fairly learned and educated individual with a working knowledge of meteorology, astronomy, physics, military aircraft, and human perception, yet the object I witnessed defied all of these schools of thought and rationale.  I am the type of person that doesn't enjoy mysteries and despite researching, careful contemplation, review, and even soul-searching, I never discovered an explanation that satisfies what I and my friends witnessed. A square object is not even aerodynamic, to say nothing of the stark black appearance of the object.

I am not prepared to say what I viewed was of extraterrestrial origin, yet at the same time I am prepared to say what I viewed does not belong in the sky  over a major metropolitan area in broad daylight for all the world to see.  There was a strange eerie stillness to the whole event.

To my knowledge no one else viewed this object with the exception of the  three of us, despite our close proximity to Interstate 65 which runs through southern Indiana and Louisville Ky. I would be quite curious if there was anyone else that happened to view this object that day.  To be perfectly honest, I would be relieved if it were infact mundane and simply mis-identified.

At the annual UFO Conference put on by the UFO Watchtower in Hooper, CO several people had the opportunity to witness UFOs.  About 2:00 PM Stan Romanek (one of the featured speakers at the event) was near the parking area outside the presentation building and was excited as he told me about the UFO he had just witnessed and taken some pictures of.  He was really excited that he got pictures of it.  He pointed out a spot above a patch of clouds near where the object was about 4 fingers (at arms length) above the distant mountain horizon in the northwest sky.

He mentioned what he saw to a couple other people earlier and walked across the field to the RV he was staying in about 1:30 PM.  He was going to put the image on his laptop computer and bring it back so we could all see what the picture looked like.  He returned and set the laptop up on a table outside under the shade of a canopy of an RV set up to serve food.  As he got the computer set up I continued to scan the skies, especially in the area he had seen the object.  We were excited to see that he did get a picture of it.  It was white in color and although it was a digital image at a distance you could make out the classic saucer shape with a bubble protrusion on top.  A few of us were taking turns looking at the image because the brightness of reflection of the sky in the monitor made it difficult to see well unless you stood directly in front of it.

While about 5 or 6 people were marveling at the picture Stan had just taken (with a Nikon Coolpix 6 mega pixel digital camera) I saw what appeared to be the same object in the same location off in the distant N/W horizon.  I would guess the distance to be at least 35 miles away based on the distance of the mountain range it appeared to be over.  It was very white and was dramatically accentuated by the darker blue sky background.  It was also about 4 fingers (arms length) above the distant mountaintop to the northwest about the width of my pinkie finger above the white cloud bank below.

I described the location as I pointed to the object for the others to identify also.  They were as excited as I was to realize for themselves how fascinating it was to watch.  You could easily see that the object was not a cloud, balloon or plane.  It stood perfectly still and the distinct sharpness of the edges eliminated it being a cloud as you could compare it to other clouds in the area.

We all watched as the stationery object defied cloud movement and all other rational or logical cross references we could use.  Someone noticed an identical object about a pinkie width directly above the one we were watching.  The one above slowly moved downward toward the original object until it was directly over the other nearly touching it.

After watching the object for a minute or two to eliminate any plausible explanation for what I was witnessing I went to get my camera and took 3 pictures.  The 5 mega pixel Kodak photos were not distinct as the ones Stan took and only showed a white spot with no definition.  At that time I left to tell others in the nearby building attending the conference about what was happening outside.  By the time I returned both objects had left in different directions according to those watching it.

I served in the military in the mid- late 1960s in Naval Air Intelligence and was trained in aircraft identification.  I am confident this was a physical object and not any kind of natural phenomenon.  I have attached the 2 photos I took even though they are very poor quality compared to what we were visibly seeing.

Another odd note is that 6 individuals? cell phones or watches were 1 hour off that morning plus another was 2 hours and another was off by 3 hours.  The cell phone services were provided by at least 3 different services.  No one had any explanation for this oddity.

In the summr of 1989 I had been on my new job for about a year.  I'm in to health food products, and a co-worker told me that there was one near my place of employment. She said that she believed it was a small store.  At 5:00 P.M., I left my job and started looking for the store. I figured that it would be nice to be able to purchase items like vitamins, etc. on my lunch hour. By the time you get off from work and travel to these little stores, they're closed.  I walked down the street slowly, looking on both sides of the avenue, trying to find the store.  Eventually, I came upon a small store that I figured had a good chance of being it.  The building above it was abrownstone that was boarded up.  I steped down the one or two steps and opened the door to the shop.  Almost as soon as I walked in, I had a feeling that this wasn't the best place.  There was a man there.  He was my height 5""6"", skinny, dark, but otherwise normal.  I have a very clear, loud voice, and because of my previous vocal instructions over time, somewhat loud.  I asked the man, whether he had whatever the herbal remedy was that I wanted.  He became very angry and said in a voice that was almost as loud as mine""you got some nerve coming in here with all that attitude.""  I immediately answered him with ""what the hell are you talking about atitude.  Without saying another word, He aimed his finger at my heart and something that I coiuldn't see hit me in the heart.  I have ben know for having a lot ot courage so me being me, I just stood there and stirred at him. Then he said, ""I could have just killed you."" I then realized that I was in more danger than I realized. I also knew what I had accidentally come upon.  There was a conversation that followed where I sought of asked where he was from, but he only said that it was a long way from here.There was great emphysis on long. Every time he moved around the store, you never saw him move to another location, he just appeared at that spot. Some how, I was asleep and while still standing, I felt my feet being kind of numb.  I had been standing in that same spot for a couple of hours. When I finally got up the nerve to say that I was leaving, he said"" we are leaving tomorrow to. That would have been Wednesday. I walked to the door, and as I looked around he said, ""when you get home tonight I want you to say xxxxxxx.  I didn't say it then and I won't say it now.  As far as I am concerned, that could have been some password the he could have used to take me aboard his space ship.  As I placed my hans on the door, his face blurred and changed to what he really looked like.  He was still my height, very dark, but his eyes were large but that skin around the eyes reminded me of a crocodile.  Ther was a thin yellow line running from one corner of the eye to the other. And he laughed out loud. He surely wasn't pretty. I really wanted to ask more questions, but thought better of it.  On Thursday, the day after he said they were leaving, I walked down to that store, near the curb.  I wanted to see if there was anybody there.  Would you believe, the place looked as though no one had ever been there.   It was empty.

 I rode past on the bus ther other day, and the place had been undergoing renovations.

It's now a nice looking brownstone with a store.  I'd like to know who rented it before.  The things that I saw him do, couldn't have been done by anyone other than an alien.  I'm now actually glad that I had the experience.  It told me what I suspected all along, that we are living with these people and cannot tell the difference. When I saw how he just changed his appearance within one or two seconds, I was surprized, to say the least.

 This really happened in 1989.  I was sought of afraid to mention it because I didn't know whether or not I should.  Don't know who you're speaking to these days.

Peter, this is FYI since the sightings don't come first hand.  These are the ones I remember from my year's in service.  Any others weren't worth remembering.  Thanks for the help when I gave my report on the radio.

I noticed that when I sent the last sighting to you, the ""replay"" did not show the breakdown into paragraphs.  Hope you have a way of decoding the message into paragraphs as it was written.  Also, the time of the sighting requires one to place an exact time a time even if the exact time is not known.

I did not check ""I would like to be contacted by an investigator"", but you may call any time you wish.

REPORT:  
 
In late 1960, I was assigned to the 30th Air Transport Squadron operating from McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey.  I had my navigator's wings, but every command had its own types of aircraft, methods, and secrets of navigating, so I was provided with an instructor until I was ready to be checked out by a flight examiner.  We were flying in Douglas C-118s, mostly the 1953 model, but with some 1951 models.  The C-118 is the same as the DC-6B, but with a reinforced floor (higher floor loading) for carrying cargo on occasion.  Usually, we carried passengers.  The 30th Squadron was one of several who comprised a group which was part of the 1611th Air Transport Wing.

The first sighting of interest that we spoke of when I was in the Air Force came from an F-106 pilot who was the next door neighbor of the man who related the details to me.  In chronological order, this is what happened.

On the night of March 12, 1961, two ocean station vessels found an object hovering off the east coast of the U.S.  By way of explanation, an ocean station vessel at that time was a ship which was kept at a particular latitude and longitude off one of our coasts or in mid-ocean.

They acted as picket ships with early warning radar during this cold war period and as rescue vessels if a plane needed to ditch near them.

When two of them off the coast of New Jersey picked up the hovering object on radar, they were able to calculate its precise altitude and geographic location.  This information was fed to NORAD (North American Air Defense) and to the ADC (Air Defense Command) contingent at McGuire AFB where I was stationed.  Consequently, two F-106 interceptors were scrambled.

They climbed to the altitude of the hovering object and closed on it.  As they closed, they both picked up the object on their airborne radar sets and saw it visually as a glowing green ball. As they closed, the object began to move straight upward.  The F-106s followed.

In a very short time, the interceptors were left behind and the object disappeared in the distance.

There was a mandatory form we all had to fill out (an intelligence report) when certain things were witnessed (things such as encounters involving electronic ""warfare"" with Russian trawlers, Soviet ground stations, etc.).  At the debriefing, the 106 pilots were required to fill out and sign this form (one form for each of them).  This process could take a long time, especially after a tiring mission (something I discovered later on).  The debriefing officer kept insisting that (1) their radar sets were malfunctioning, (2) that the lead pilot saw an reflection in his windscreen, and (3) that the second pilot saw the exhaust of the first F-106.  Since, the pilots were honest individuals who hated to be pushed around, they refused to recant what had happened and filled out the forms and signed them correctly.

The base housing at McGuire at that time largely consisted of units in a row with one ""apartment"" wall being the same wall for the adjacent ""apartment"".  A navigator named John Gargus (confidential information) who was part of the 1611th Air Transport Wing lived in one of these apartments.  One of the F-106 pilots lived in one of the two next door to John.  After the 106 pilots were released, the one next door to John (who was friend of John's) came over to complain bitterly about the incident and his subsequent treatment.

On March 13, Neil (my instructor) and I left with John and the rest of the aircrew on a mission to Rhein Main Air Base near Frankfurt, Germany.  We landed at Rhein Main on the 14th.  After we had checked in to our quarters and were cleaning up (about 3:15 PM local time),  I overheard John talking to Neil.  I asked for John to repeat what he was telling Neil and he did so.  The story he told is the one related above.

No one seemed to be particularly amazed at this story, but took it matter of factly.  There was some sympathy for the F-106 pilot that was forced to disclose this sighting.  From this and other indications, I realized that there was danger to one's career should one happen to ever mention  seeing certain things in the sky.  In the years that followed, it was evident that the Air Force ""first line troops"" had an underground that knew about certain supposed visitors while the top brass did all they could to sweep things under the rug.

I have no idea where to find John Gargus at this time and no idea whether or not he would be willing to tell where the F-106 pilot is - and odds are he may not know.  However, I will try to see if I can discover anything without going to excessive trouble.  At that time, John was a first lieutenant assigned to wing headquarters.

The second sighting I would like to mention was related by my flight examiner navigator, then a Captain, later a Major, named Jordan W. Grant.  We called him ""Pappy Grant"" and he was probably in his forties at the time.

On December 5, 1962, I was given a line check from Pappy, again to Rhein Main.

During our two-day crew rest in Germany, we had several meals together and at one of them, Pappy related the following story.

It was during a mission in over the Pacific and Pappy was navigating.  It was daylight and Pappy had the LORAN set on as well as the radar (which was always on when it was working correctly).  Suddenly the display on the LORAN scope and the display on the radar scope shrunk, leaving only a dot in the middle of each scope.  The compasses began to gyrate wildly.

Pappy stuck his head into the cockpit and found the pilots gibbering incoherently and looking fearfully back as best they could from their side windows.  Pappy asked what had happened.  Finally, they calmed down enough to tell him.  One told him that a flaming red ball had just nearly hit them head-on and that he was afraid that it might return.  The second said the same thing but claimed that there were four balls instead of just one.  The ball or balls had been at the same altitude as the airplane and flying straight and level.

Eventually, the radar, the LORAN set, and the compasses returned to normal.

Chances are Pappy is no longer alive.  He had a master's degree in marine biology and worked on his own blueberry farm with his wife between missions.  He would eat two large steaks whenever he could and enjoyed good food perhaps more than he should have.  If you have any suggestions on how to find either John or Pappy, please let me know.  A search on line might help.  Pappy was more than just a flight examiner with a higher rank than most of us.  He was a valuable friend to us all.","Currently a writer",NA,1,"sphere",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1961,1960,1,3,21,"Evening","Northeast",1,0,0,0,0

I took my food into the house and returned with a set of binoculars.  The craft had moved about 10-degrees in just a few minutes and was stationary (in a roughly 15-mph wind).  Viewing through the binoculars revealed a very bright silver sphere at roughly 2,000 feet. I did not have a hard time focusing on it as it was completely stationary (clouds were flowing by it at a good clip).  Anyway after about 5-minutes of viewing the craft seemed to go into a cloud. The odd thing was there seemed to be some sort of other strange shaped object in the cloud (though not at all well defined).  Both disappeared and no further sightings.

51st and Memorial Drive, South West corner behind what would someday be Skaggs/Albertsons but at the time was an open undeveloped field boarding my neighborhood.

  It was very early in the morning, approximately 5AM.  I was awakened by a female presence from my bedroom and I had this desire to get my bicycle out of my parents garage and go riding.

The sun wouldn't be up for another hour.   It was the summer.  It was in the 70's, within a month or two of the June 8th, 1974 Tornadoes which destroyed Tulsa, Oklahoma, my home town.  I was outside riding my bicycle in my neighborhood, just 300 yards from my house.  The sun was just coming up.  There was this very unusual popcorn shrimp like cloud formations in the sky.   Just thousands of clouds which were white and puffy alto cumulus like clouds which were spaced out widely in the shape of curled up popcorn shrimp.   The local media weather personality on Channel 8, Don Woods, commented on how rare this day was because Tulsa had never had this kind of weather clouds before in it's recorded history.  I am to believe that this incident may have been just before June 8th, before the T.V. stations were knocked down by the tornadoes.  I have searched and searched for the exact name of these clouds and their exact date and history has buried it.  I can't find it.  Anyway, I'm riding my bike on dark streets back and forth, back and forth, until the sun rises for one hour when I see these clouds.   Their startling clouds.

 I can barely find information on the June 8th 1974 triple twister storm which almost took my life and my family's life and left us in ruin for the balance of the year of 1974.  It was truly an awful time with not running water, no gas, no electricity, no phone and no T.V.   All we had was KRMG AM radio to inform the community for quite a while.   AM radios and batteries and lots of kerosene burning Coleman products to make light and cook our food.

 As I rode my bike, the sun came over the horizon and you could see all these very strange shaped clouds.   And there were no cars running nor jet aircraft landing.  It was as if Tulsa was frozen.

No noise outside at all, not even birds.  And I heard this one noise growing and growing as if it was coming from an aircraft or something up in the air and I began to point my eyes to the direction of this very unique, unearthly noise.  I would hear where it was coming from and move my eyes to the noise as it moved through the skies above me yet I saw nothing.  It flew right over me I would guess at the altitude of a landing jet aircraft and proceeded off to the east.   I kept peddling my bike eastward following the sound and looking up and continued to see nothing as the sound faded away.  This whole encounter did not take just 3 minutes, it was like 25 minutes.

It moved as slowly as a Goodyear blimp from the sound as the sound moved in the skies as my ears could track that sound yet I saw nothing and it didn't wake anybody up in the neighborhood.

When the sound finally disappeared in the east, I was standing on the ground straddling my bike.

Not 5 minutes passed and the entire neighborhood woke up and came to life.   People went out to get their paper, started mowing lawns, dogs started barking, tire sounds of cars were heard on Memorial drive, all the noise of life returned as if somebody just threw a switch.  It was really weird as a 13 year old I actually recognized this and knew major things were wrong here.....

 And for some reason, I forgot about this sound.  I just shelved it in my mind and never ever thought about it again.  I never spoke with anybody about it.  Never made it a bid deal.

  I also had at the time dreams of being a bird and being able to fly in my own back yard.  I used to dream somebody taught me to flap my wings and I would actually fly around up to 1000 feet high.   And this female person would talk to me then and was like my foster mother if you will.

I was encouraged to fly and remember topping the chimney on my parents house and actually flying just above the cloud cover of the town and hovering there for hours at night.  It was always at night.

It was a female but I never could remember her face.   But she took a liking to me as a child.

And then I never heard anything more from her again.   This whole thing probably spanned just 4 months as I remember.   But I shelved the entire thing and never told anybody.

 I also remembered looking into the neighborhood houses for open windows of known Rock and Roll stereo freaks who might have a stereo playing but all windows were shut that I could see and besides, the sound was from above me and slightly to the south heading west to east in direction as it moved.  It also wasn't the kind of sound which was played back from a recording with hiss or scratch sounds like a record does, it was the REAL THING SOUND.  It had the decibels of a powerful engine or something like that.   There was no stereo which could make a noise that loud which was obviously far up in the air somewhere up there.

 It also gave me the feeling that somebody was looking down on me, the one kid outside with the bicycle chasing this sound and not being able to catch it and I felt this terrible, awful sorrow coming from somewhere as if a family member was either just abandoned or died or perhaps the feeling you get when your best pet dog is killed in a violent way.  A very sorrowful, sad feeling which actually made tears come to my eyes finally as the sound finally went away to the east and was never heard from again.  I had the feeling that I was just abandoned like a mom would say goodbye to here child for the last time never to see him ever again.   There was a sense of concern and fear and I remembered now, at the time I was led to believe I was going to have a very hard and challenging life.

 I was 13 years of age at this time.

 Lost in space had been on T.V. and the sound of that spaceship in that T.V. series was Erie but not similar to this sound.   This sound was not man made it was real.  And so I grew up, and time just buried all of this.  I never heard this sound again and forgot about all this until recently.

 I'm 46 years old now.  I'm driving across country and the AM radio is on.   Coast to Coast AM is playing and George Noory.  He's interviewing Michael Horn.   Michael Horn is supposed to be the U.S. press representative of Billy Meier from Switzerland.  And I listened to this interview they did and somewhere in the middle of it they played the wedding cake ship sound.  I said to myself as soon as 10 seconds of this sound was played that I've heard this before somewhere??? And I began to ask myself which T.V. show or Movie did I hear this sound on before so I could know where these guy's ripped this sound off from.

 I eventually went to the website and downloaded this sound and played it a few times and it all started coming back to me.  I was asking same question back in 1974.  I remembered that morning.  I remembered the weird bicycle ride I took that summer morning.  Asking the question is this sound was coming from a neighbors house, what T.V. show or movie  did they get it from.  Yet I knew it wasn't coming from a neighbors house or some passing car's 8 track.   This is 1974 you see, not even the cassette tape was popular then.  Microwave ovens and cable T.V. were years off.  Color T.V. was just getting popular.  FM stereo existed but not widely used in cars yet.  Cars still typically had noisy AM radio with 8 track players bolted on.    We didn't even have synthesizers in that era to manufacture a noise like this.

 But I heard this damn noise.  I felt those feelings.  I had those dreams in my sleep of flying with my other mom.  I felt some love from this person.

 And I have some post comments to make to this female person, whoever it was.

After having done some years research on Billy Meier and the Pleiadians and finding out that these people frequent all of our media and are somewhat experts on Human current events.

If what I have read and felt are indeed true, then I'm dealing with an emotional being who's not learned to separate herself from her science projects....    And I'm sorry you never had a child.

And while it's sad that you people actually read the contact reports from this very website, maybe you'll read this one and remember what you did back in 74.

 I know it was you and I shake my head and ask the question if you leave that much concern in a 13 year old childs mind how are your possibly going to help mankind?  It was the certain knowledge and admission that this sound was the Wedding Cake Ship.

That the Wedding Cake ship was commissioned at around this time.

 And I'm left with the question, why Tulsa, Oklahoma?  Was it the knowledge we were about to be greased by a large group of Tornadoes?   Was there something special about me? All I'm personally left with is she decided to adopt me as her son for a few months and perhaps study me, I guess...  I dunno....

 But I did hear that Wedding Cake ship sound on that popcorn shrimp cloud day which we have never had again, ever....

On Wednesday, October 24th, I and a coworker had an experience on Highway 33 outside of Roca, NE (about 3 miles west on 33).  My coworker, who has since quit, will not contribute to this report so I will not use his experiences although I would prefer as they are more ""colorful"" than my own. 

A little background here; I am (or at least was) happily married and prefer to stay that way, and my wife will not listen to me and DOES NOT support my reporting this but after researching online I feel I must do this. 

I am a 28 year old who graduated from a very small town in Nebraska, so I do not expect anyone to take me serious that this took place. People who have an education or money would be, but I am just a regular guy I guess, but here it goes anyway. 

I have had a bit of a personality crisis (as well as a whiskey crisis) for the last few days and I?m just trying to get by.  Frankly, I am annoyed that this happened, and 4 nights later I am still annoyed and not enjoying my  life if you don?t mind me speaking my mind.

I was driving a commercial truck used to move frozen food that is sold retail, and there were two of us, one in each truck returning to our ?office?. I was ahead of my coworker, when we turned a bend in the highway, ahead there was a black square in the sky. I don?t know how else to describe it, there were no lights or sounds, just a square floating.  I nearly had a heart attack when I saw it, keep in mind-and this important-that it wasn?t there when I came around the bend, it just appeared. 

It was low and almost on the road and I locked up my brakes.  My truck is heavy and admittedly we speed, so I was all over the road. I came to a stop and got out.  All I saw was this black square. I am not trying to sound dramatic.  But it was simply a black square, moving very slowly-hardly moving-to the south. 

This is when thing get weird, cause my coworker gets out of his truck and his face is white as a sheet, and he says ((deleted))all this for selling ice cream door-to-door.""  

I am staring at this black floaty thing, and then suddenly my coworker is gone. I mean thin air gone. 

Suddenly from the cornfield about 50 yards ahead from the south comes my buddy screaming bloody hell.  His eyes are so big it?s like all I can see are his eyes to this minute, and all I can see to his right is this dark square, and as he is running to me, his arms out wide as if to hug me, and there comes this horn, ya know like compressed air you have on your boat, and I duck. 

My coworker jumps into my truck and shuts and locks the doors, and here I am prying on the door handle screaming like a school girl and I look behind me and see a guy, like a little skinny guy  along the ditch, and this is where I become a drinker, cause the guy is looking at me all menacing like he is coming to kill me and he is skin and bones with a big ass head. 

Jim lets me in and I put in drive and push this International to 120. 

My wife is mad, don?t make trouble for me please, but you all don?t know (or belief) but I do.

My self and two of my cousins were walking along the street heading west. We were going to have pizza. Ahead of us the houses thin out and there was a section of about two city blocks where there were no houses, just grass lots. Beyond that was a small unused strip mall,some fast food and other types of stores. Beyond that was Interstate 57. As we talked we noticed a string of red lights appear above the dark strip mall. We could make out a form that was darker than the night sky.  To me seemed round with the lights ringing the middle. I would say it was about 30-40 feet across.The object started to move very slowly to the north west. I remember we talked about what it could be, One of my cousins said it must be a helicopter to move so slowly and hover like that. About that time the lights went out. a few moments later a small private airplane crossed the sky to the south east. We could plainly hear its motor. That ruled out a helicopter. The object could still be made out as a dark spot in the sky. It moved west until it reached the interstate highway at which it moved lower and went north along the highway. We could plainly see the traffic moving under it. It went north along roadway until just about the exit/overpass at which time it tilted skyward and in a blur was gone. We were shocked and at this point we knew it was nothing we could point a finger at and say ""that was it"" We talked excitedly and ran to the pizza place. We had been there maybe three minutes. Standing in line to place our order when a man in his early 20's came running in. He was hysterical. He asked where the phone was, he had just chased a UFO on the interstate. People in line snickered and we stopped talking about it until we were seated. Obviously he had seen the same thing we had.

Some friends and I were ordering some food at the drive through window of the local fast food restaurant. We were staying at a motel next door and had decided to just walk up to the window instead of going inside. It was already pretty late and we didn?t think they would mind.

I placed my order and walked off to watch the cars go by as my friends placed their orders. I don?t know what made me look up; maybe it was a sense of motion or movement that caught my eye. I looked up and I saw a dark triangle shaped object with three lighter shaded circles at each of the corners. The circles were not really lighter in color but maybe not as black. The object was just within the glow of the street lights being reflected off the street but not quite low enough to be fully illuminated. For some reason it seemed darker than the night sky above it.

It moved at a very slow, deliberate pace as if not in any real hurry. It seemed like it was observing maybe. There was no sound either. It seemed to float or glide without any sound of any kind of propulsion.

Whatever it was doing, it never increased its speed and slowly made its way down the street and disappeared into the dark.

We were in a car, traveling to Fred Meyer's to get some food.  Suddenly a triangle shaped aircraft appeared over the mountains (more like big hills with houses) to our right.  It had 3 lights on the corners (on the bottom), and three on top (but on the same corners), so it appeared to be roughly 1/8 as tall as it was long (But it did look like a solid triangular object).

 It also appeared to be pretty far up, and considering that it moved fairly fast.  It originally came over the hills and west straight, perpendicular to the highway, before making a 90 degree right-turn and following the highway.  After that turn, it slowly veered off to the left again, diverging from the path of the highway.

I wasn't going to report this until I saw that someone else from this exact same city experienced something similar just two months ago. So, I decided to also write a report since there must obviously be something going on here that is unexplained and I would like answers.

 Earlier this morning (Sunday Jan. 20th, 2008) at approximately 5:58 AM I decided to look out of my front door to see if the ground was covered with ice (we had a lot of rain last evening and freezing temperatures overnight), and as I was looking out the front door I noticed something completely strange to my left. It was floating above the tree line across from a field approximately 1/2 mile from my front door. The lights were pulsating from red to orange (similar to flames from a forest fire) as this thing or craft was slowly receding behind the tree line behing the open field.

 It seemed to have three large lights from the side I was seeing. And judging from the neighbors house down the road and the distance this craft was from their home and ours, it had to be atleast the size 4 or 5 homes combined, possibly even larger. A truly amazing site and a camera was the last thing on my mind.

 Anyway, I couldn't believe what I was seeing, so I went to wake my wife up to verify what I was seeing. She quickly awoke when I told her that she had to see something that was going to blow her mind. I was hoping this thing wouldn't be gone before we made it back to the front door. When we both got to the front door it was still there and was now half way down behind the tree line. My wife said "" oh my God, what is that?"". We both looked at it in awe as it descended behind the trees and seemed to have landed.

The area it seemed to have landed in is near a creek in a swampy area. In a place people wouldn't normally go or have good access to. All I could think is why would someone or something be landing there.

 My wife and I stared in the direction for nearly an hour to see if it was going to fly away. She described it as being similar to the sun going down behind the trees due to the brightness it displayed and the red and orange colors, But this definitely wasn't the sun, it was only 5:58 AM and was in the north west during the dark of night. She was only able to see the top half of the object and the lights as it was already landing as I awoke her. We both couldn't believe what we had just seen. This definitely was like nothing I had ever seen, especially this close to our own home. I must mention that I am prior military (U.S. Army Veteran) and I am very observant and have an IQ of 138. This definitely didn't seem like any modern day aircraft that our military would have and even if it were, why would they land in the middle of the swampy creek area here at 5:58 AM on a Sunday morning?  As far as the shape of the craft, it seemed to be an oval shape and had no sound at all as we stepped out of the front door to listen as it was landing. Another thing that was real odd was that this is in a suburban neighborhood with lots of yard animals and none of the dogs were barking at all and the air was dead silent.

 As big as the object was and as bright as the lights were, we were expecting to at least hear the neighborhood dogs barking, but none were.

 After waiting on the front porch of our home for close to an hour with blankets to keep warm, we finaly decided to go back into the house. We were hoping this craft would come back up from the wooded area and would show itself once again while leaving, but it never did. And no, I don't plan on going in that area of the woods and swamp to see it close up either. I will be keeping a guarded eye on that area for the next few nights and even months to see if anything else happens there.

 All I can say about all this is that we're definitely not alone and these things are making themselves known. I'm just wondering why they aren't trying to communicate more clearly if they are superior life forces. It almost feels as though we are like the ants living in the ant farm and they just observe us when they want to. A little food for thought there.

 Anyway, thanks for allowing me to vent about this here, because I surely can't tell me friends about this. I'm not sure how they would take it.

On the day of this incident, a friend and I went to explore a field and empty reservoir in this field. We wanted to come back to it that night, and enjoy the moon and conversation away from town life. We came back with another person that night. We walked to the end of the field for no reason in particular, and noticed 2 orange lights over the trees. They were moving quite slow, sometimes not moving at all. They appeared small, as if they were planes. They would head east away from the ocean. They would circle around and disappear behind the hills. They usually appeared in twos, separated by quite a distance. They would always appear from behind hills or trees. They sometimes appeared from nothingness. They would sometimes turn off the lights, and then appear with light configuration like jet planes. They had up to 7 lights, most commonly 2 headlights with ?wing? lights and up to 3 lights in the back. But they were too low and too fast and silent, and were not jet planes. At times we could see up to 6 in the air. We called our friend and he came with his girlfriend. We watched the triangle and squares and diamond crafts fly around, like bees. They would often change path, and were just observing. It seemed that other crafts would appear in the paths of other crafts. We had a flashlight, and when I flashed patterns on the field one turned its headlight toward us and changed course to fly directly above us. They were triangular in shape when we saw them from below. From the sides, they appeared oblong and very large. They appeared very bright, and I do not think jets or prop planes have these bright of headlights. Our observations were mildly disturbing, and 4 of us were convinced they were UFO?s, but the only girl with us was still skeptical. This was about to change. Over a hedgerow cypress forest, 2 lights, dime sized to us only 1,500 feet away, hovered for maybe 2 minutes. There was a faint glowing aura in the trees below. They moved slowly around, and we could see one turn away and he! ad for t he ocean. The other continued closer to us, within 600 feet, following a drainage ditch it seemed like. It hovered to the highway, and looked at the traffic from about 700 feet up. It then went over the hills and disappeared. We could see it with binoculars, and it had a bright halogen like head light, and a green light on the back with a red light above it. On the back were 2 white lights, with a red light underneath each one. It looked like an observer. The red light blinked very faintly. After this one had left, we didn?t see anymore that night. We left to pick up some food.

I worked as a manager at a popular fast food chain and after closing, I was getting a ride home with another employee. As we drove down the street late at night, we suddenly saw what appeared to be a bright green star. It grew in intensity, made the whole sky seem to glow slightly green, then split in two and shot off in different directions. 

We were both completely silent for about 15 seconds before he asked if I saw that. I confirmed that I did.

It was Mid-October 1990, I was thirteen years old and was on the phone with a friend when my father came in my room and told me that I needed to feed our dog, which stayed outside. It was around 9:00 p.m. I got the dog food and went to do the chore quickly so I could get back on the phone. It was a clear and cool night. While walking to feed the dog I noticed how beautiful the sky and stars were. I bent down to pour the food out into the dog dish as I stood up, I noticed this oval shaped flying object that had green and red lights circling in the middle. There were windows in the craft where I actually seen a green figure with a huge head and big bulging black eyes. This figure is just like what is reported in most alien sightings. This is how I know that I am not crazy. I seen this way before people went Area 51 crazy like they did in the late 90?s. The craft was flying extremely low across a field. After staring at it for about 2-3 minutes, the curiosity left and fear took over because it noticed me and started coming my way. I ran straight toward the house. As I approached the steps I looked back as the craft quickly went backwards out of sight. I was upset and got my parents to walk out to see maybe they could see it. They did not get to, it was gone. I knew what I seen. If you tell people this story they think you are making it up. After almost 18 years, I think about the sighting often and have a lot of questions. This sighting happened in Reidsville, GA. I could understand how people would feel this story is far fetched because if I would not have seen it, believing it  would be difficult, especially since I am almost a 31 year old man.

# of witnesses: 2

Description: Landing of a 3 lighted, fairly large craft with pulsing red to amber lights. No sound at all.

Description by witness narrative: 

I  wasn?t going to report this until I saw that someone else from this exact same city experienced something similar just two months ago. So, I decided to also write a report since there must obviously be something going on here that is unexplained and I would like answers.

Earlier this morning (Sunday Jan. 20th, 2008) at approximately 5:58 AM I decided to look out my front door to see if the ground was covered with ice (we had a lot of rain last evening and freezing temperatures overnight), and as I was looking out the front door I noticed something completely strange to my left.  It was floating above the tree line across from a field approximately ? mile from my front door. The lights were pulsating from red to orange (similar to flames from a forest fire) as this thing or craft was slowly receding behind the tree line behind the open field? ?It seemed to have three large lights from the side I was seeing. And judging from the neighbor?s house down the road and the distance this craft was from their home and ours, it had to be at least the size of 4 or 5 homes combined, possibly even larger. A truly amazing sight and a camera was the last thing on my mind?.

?Anyway, I couldn?t believe what I was seeing, so I went to wake my wife up to verify what I was seeing. She quickly awoke when I told her that she had to see something that was going to blow her mind. I was hoping this thing wouldn?t be gone before we made it back to the front door. When we both got to the front door it was still there and was now half way down behind the tree line. My wife said ?oh my God, what is that?? We both looked at it in awe as it descended behind the trees and seemed to have landed?.

?The area it seemed to have landed in is near a creek in a swampy area.  In a place people wouldn?t  normally go or have good access to. All I could think is why would someone or something be landing there?.

? My wife and I stared in the direction for nearly an hour to see if it was going to fly away. She described it as being similar to the sun going down behind the trees due to the brightness it displayed and the red and orange colors, but this definitely wasn?t the sun, it was only 5:58 AM and was in the north west during the dark of night. She was only able to see the top half of the object and the lights as it was already landing as I awoke her. We both couldn?t believe what we had just seen. This definitely was like nothing I had ever seen, especially this close to our own home.. I must mention that I am prior military (US. Army Veteran) and I am very observant and have an IQ of 138. This definitely didn?t seem like any modern day aircraft that our military would have and even if it were, why would they land in the middle of the swampy creek area at 5:58 AM on a Sunday morning?? ?As far as the shape of the craft, it seemed to be an oval shape and had no sound at all as we stepped out the front door to listen as it was landing. Another thing that was real odd was that this is in a suburban neighborhood with lots of yard animals and none of the dogs were barking at all and the air was dead silent?.

?As big as the object was and as bright as the lights were, we were expecting to at least hear the neighborhood dogs barking, but none were?.

?After waiting on the front porch of our home for close to an hour with blankets to keep warm, we finally decided to go back into the house. We were hoping this craft would come back up from the wooded area and would show itself once again while leaving, but it never did. And no, I don?t plan on going in that area of the woods and swamp to see it close up either. I will be keeping a guarded eye on that area for the next few nights and even months to see if anything else happens there?.

?All I can say about this is that we?re definitely not alone and these things are making themselves known. I?m just wondering why they aren?t trying to communicate more clearly if they are superior life forces. It\ almost feels as though we are like the ants living in the ant farm and they just observe us when they want to. A little food for thought there.?.

?Anyway, thanks for allowing me to vent about this here, because I surely can?t tell me friends(sic) about this. I?m not sure how they would take it?.

END OF ORIGINAL REPORT!  Upon receiving the permission of Mr. Peter Davenport to investigate this sighting report he sent this Field Investigator for MUFON the witness contact information.

I contacted the witness by phone and set up an appointment at his home for January 31st, 2008 at 3PM.

The primary witness is  married with two children, a boy  and a girl . He owns his own business. His wife  works at a local business. Their residence was very clean and modern.  East Dublin, Ga. is a very clean and prosperous appearing town located in Laurens County, Ga. long: w 82.9 and lat: n 32.5.

This FI arrived at the witness? address at 1PM on 1/31/08  and spent the next hour scouting the area of the sighting and getting the lay-out of the community/neighborhood surrounding the residence.

 Moving North passed the residence on the road they live , on the right side of the road at approximately 100 feet distance from witness? driveway is a high-end subdivision  made up of approximately 1 acre parcels with large,modern homes which are located in an open, spacious property with a view across its expanse of approximately ? mile in most directions. The road upon which the witness lives dead ends 1.10 miles into another road that runs in a West to East direction.  100 yards to the East on this road is a Georgia Power Company grid line of tall electrical towers. On the North side of this road the grid can be seen running at the foot of a long ridge (hill) approximately 250 to 300 feet high in a West to Easterly direction. This power line grid crosses over this road in a South Eastern direction where a creek crosses under the roadway at a bridge and the creek and the grid together runs into and through a swampy, mixed forest area of several 100?s of acres. The creek has created a boggy, wet-land area and there are no roads, paths, or other entrances into this location, which is the direction of the witness? sighting from his residence of 1.10 miles south of the creek.

 Heading back South on the witness? road I went to the junction with another Georgia highway and headed East for 3 ? miles. This road lead me to a power substation in 2 miles from the resident?s road. I also noticed the other side of the ridge and swampy wet-land with several tree farms and cotton fields for the 3 ? miles. Back at the residence, directly in front of it is a tree farm . This appeared to have a road that runs around the South border of the subdivision that may give access to the power-grid approximately 1 mile away that crosses both of the other roads in the area. However this land is posted with a locked gate with no contact information given on signs. Witness does not know who owns this property.

 Leaving the neighborhood I drove back into East Dublin business district and decided to have lunch at a very small, one room restaurant . I enquired of the owner if he had heard of any UFO sightings. He had not.

 I arrived at the witness? residence at 3PM. He was warm and friendly but was still plenty excited about what he and his wife had witnessed the morning of 1/20/08 and began immediately showing me the area and recapping the event. Inside the home I conducted an interview and at first brought up the issue of the time of the sighting at 05:58 AM mentioned several times in the original report, inquiring  as to what he was doing up at that time of morning after a cold, rainy, stormy night, on a day most would ?sleep in?. The witness stated he arose to check for ?snow? as the local weather provider had said it was a possibility that night and he wanted to show it to the family.

 This FI having checked the weather report, etc. before my interview, indicating according to the U.S. Naval Observatory Astronomical Department as follows: For the East Dublin area 1/20/08 @ 04:21 AM EST- winds had been out of the NW with gusts up to 20 MPH. There had been rain over the area for several hours: humidity averaged 81 % .  A severe weather system had moved across Georgia the evening of 1/19/08 and on into 1/20/08. Temperature averaged around 47* F. No snow recorded in the area.

Sunrise 1/20/08 was @ 7:32AM EST. The Moon was waxing  Gibeous with a (95% disk surface showing/ illuminated and was 2 days before full which set at the ?exact? time of 05:58 AM that morning 1/20/08(Thanks to MUFON ASD GA. MARK AUSMUS for exact moon charts) Charts on file. Witness said the sky was clear at the time of the sighting.

 Please note that the lack of animal activity (barking of dogs) that the witness originally reported does not seem to this FI to be in anyway connected to the sighting as most critters, especially family yard dogs would be bedded down after such a weather system that lasted around 12 hours  and 2 hours before sunrise.

 Nothing appears unusual of this time frame(at this time) and the witness remembers seeing the exact time of 05:58 AM on the DVD player near the front door from which the sighting took place, which he showed me.

The witness had viewed the object as he looked out of the decorative glass, front door panel, noticed the lights and opened the door.

 Recapping( again) the sighting as recorded in the original report, I had the witness go over the statement about the size estimate . I discovered that what he actually saw were 3 large, bright red/orange lights encapsulated inside a half ?dome? shape, rounded part to the top, and the 3 lights were inside, tapered back from the bottom to the top as if they were  3 panels of light. The panels of light appeared ?fire like? the sun, rather than pulsating. Estimating the size of the object was based on a neighbors house approximately ? mile North on his road. I had him do a measure at arms length exercise and we determined the object to be 1 ? inches to 2 inches at arms length, making the object 100 to 175 feet in length along its bottom at 1 mile distance.

The entire period of the actual event was 7 to 8 minutes.

 Next the witness took me outside to show the exact location ( again) where he saw the object and where his wife joined him on the porch. The direction was North, North East, not NNW as originally reported. It was NNE across the open area over the subdivision at approximately 3/4/ to 1 mile distance according to my compass readings and previous drive through observations. If the object had been floating down behind the ridge line off the other road north of the location, it would not have lit up the trees, like the witness stated to this FI, and it did light up trees located closer to a small pond located on the North East side of the subdivision. It appeared to come down behind the silhouette of one specific, large pine tree near the pond about ? mile away but the distance was probably closer to a ?  to 1 mile away in the swamp land. The witness stated that the object maneuvered ?blimp like?, moving very slowly and drifting down from about an 80 degree angle above the large pine tree and there was sky line well below the object estimated at about 100 to 150 feet above the large pine tree. Again, I wish to emphasize, as this FI viewed the exact angle of the objects dissent, it would have had to go down in front of the ridge line located on  the  other road to the north , not behind it. Again, this ridge is 1.10 miles from the residence and an astronomical object would have went down behind the ridge.

That would put the object going down into the swamp off the northern border road.

 I next spoke to the second witness, the wife, by phone at her place of business and her description was as the original report, but reiterated that ?it looked like the Sun going down at Sunset?.

I asked if she had noticed anything unusual sense the sighting. She stated that their house lights had been surging up and down over that day and a few days following. At this phone interview (on speaker phone) her husband recalled with her that the automatic, dawn to dusk, mercury vapor light in the driveway had gone out as well during that time and had not come back on. This driveway light has sense been repaired and both bulb and sensor had to be replaced. The witness also remembered at this time that he had been having all the rechargeable batteries in their cell phones, remote keyboard to his business computer and the children?s electronic toys in his home office being drained of their charges. He would charge them up and next day they would be uncharged. This FI after returning to Savannah discovered that my brand new camera?s batteries were completely drained and I had put new ones in that morning before leaving for East Dublin. Coincidence? Maybe! Witness had also noticed an intermiten humming sensation/noise  in his and his wife?s ears for 3 weeks after the sighting.

I had the witness file a formal complaint with the Georgia Power Company and at first the customer service representative said that they are not able to look up previous  power problems. Instead they did a new report on the fact that witness was experiencing humming noise and ?possible power surges sense the 19th-20th through the end of January 08. No mention was made of the battery drainage to Georgia Power company. A Ga. Power technician was dispatched to the residence that day. The witness inquired if they could explain the humming sensations and the power fluctuations, or any other problems for that time period.  The Technician?s log book indicated that 2 power sub-stations went out between January 20th and 21st, in the area. He unlocked the house?s power meter and did a few tests inside the meter ands stated it was working fine. The humming noise was not detected and the technician could only say that what had been happening must have been caused by the 2 downed sub-stations . The Technician could give no explaination for the substations failures. At this writing the only problem electrically , seems to be the continual drain of freshly charged batteries in the home. This FI nor the witness can figure this out at this time.

 This FI first speculated that the witnesses may have seen the ?Moon set? as it did in fact set at exactly the same moment the object seemed to land in the swamp. However, the Moon set in a wooded area directly? behind? the residence and was about 120 degrees in the opposite direction in the West North Westerly location at the time of the sighting.

The witness stated that the object never rose up after 1 hour . After approximately 30 minutes of waiting for the object to rise , a meteor, which the witness described as normal except that it was very short in duration with only a very short trajectory of about 1 to 2 inches at arms length appearing. They speculated that they felt it was connected in some way with the object. This FI does not.

 As the witness? children arrived from school on the day of the interview/investigation, he introduced me to them and I interviewed them briefly. They had not seen anything, but knew all about the details. The  daughter had had a ?nightmare? about seeing the lights similar to what her parent?s had described and had drawn a picture (on file) of the object. She slept with her parent?s that night.

This FI does not believe this was a ?recall? experience by the child but simply that this incident has impacted this family in a stressful and negative way.

 The witness claims to have a high IQ and so does his  son. The witness has been troubled over the fact that he cannot reconcile what he saw with what he knows to be normal and logical, He has stated to this FI that it affected him as he has become protective and concerned for the families safety more than usual.

This FI believes  the daughter has seen and heard her parent?s attempts to explain the incident and became fearful.  I told the witness to consider playing down the incident to help his daughter overcome her initial fears. He agreed.

 This FI has 35 years experience as a professional clinical counselor and 27 years as a Christian Pastor and I can say with some certain knowledge that the witnesses (husband & wife) have experienced something that has disturbed their normal life in a dramatic way and this disturbance has spilled over to their children. I have checked back once per week with the witness as of this writing and they are still trying to figure out what they saw.

 UFO TOOLS website gives this case with the evidence available at a 57.5% reliability, strangeness 14.29%, info quality 10%, certainty 00.82% Valle classification is FB1 possibly FB2 considering the electrical circumstantial evidence.

The probability of the object being a plasma ball over  the power grid would be highly likely except for the fact that it was first seen moving 100 to 150 feet above the tree line that hides the grid line from line of sight from the witness? front porch. Along with the appearance of being a ?dome? or half a circle/sphere with lighted panels ,this probability is slim .

FYI/ The witness mentioned the reason he made the report was because of another sighting in East Dublin 2 months prior. This incident also was reported to NUFORC on 11/26/2007. The report is similar at first examination and I can see why this witness of 1/20/08 was prompted to file his report.

It was unfortunate that this FI was unable to gain access to the swampy area where the object went down to check for traces of its presence. However, due to the overall evidence of the circumstances and the insistence of the witness to remain anonymous, and the consistency of the testimonies and the adverse affect it had on the them and their children, I conclude at this time that this case should be classified ?unknown?. However, this case will remain open for this FI and contact with these witnesses will continue until I am personally satisfied they have some closure.

This FI arrived at the witness? address at 1PM on 1/31/08  and spent the next hour scouting the area of the sighting and getting the lay-out of the community/neighborhood surrounding the residence.

 Moving West past the residence on the road they live , on the right side of the road at approximately 100 feet distance from witness's driveway is a high-end subdivision  made up of approximately 1 acre parcels with large ,modern homes which are located in an open, spacious property with a view across its expanse of approximately ? mile in most directions. The road upon which the witness lives dead ends 1.10 miles into another road that runs in a South to North direction.  100 yards to the North on this road is a Georgia Power Company grid line of tall electrical towers. On the South side of this road the grid can be seen running at the foot of a long ridge (hill) approximately 250 to 300 feet high in a South to North direction. This power line grid crosses over this road in a  Eastern direction where a creek crosses under the roadway at a bridge and the creek and the grid together runs into and through a swampy, mixed forest area of several 100?s of acres. The creek has created a boggy, wet-land area and there are no roads, paths, or other entrances into this location, which is the direction of the witness? sighting from his residence of 1.10 miles from of the creek.

 Heading back East on the witness? road I went to the junction with another Georgia highway and headed North for 3 ? miles. This road led me to a power substation in 2 miles from the resident?s road. I also noticed the other side of the ridge and swampy wet-land with several tree farms and cotton fields for the 3 ? miles.

Back at the residence, directly in front of it is a tree farm . This appeared to have a road that runs around the North border of the subdivision but aerial maps indicate that it does not run far enough around to give access to the presumed landing area and falls short at least  ? of a mile from it, ending in the forest  behind the subdivision. Another road West of residence of witness does give access through a home owner?s property, but the witness is reluctant for them to be contacted at this time.

 Leaving the neighborhood I drove back into East Dublin business district and decided to have lunch at a very small, one room restaurant . I enquired of the owner if he had heard of any UFO sightings. He had not.

 I arrived at the witness? residence at 3PM. He was warm and friendly but was still plenty excited about what he and his wife had witnessed the morning of 1/20/08 and began immediately showing me the area and recapping the event. Inside the home I conducted an interview and at first brought up the issue of the time of the sighting at 05:58 AM mentioned several times in the original report, inquiring  as to what he was doing up at that time of morning after a cold, rainy, stormy night, on a day most would ""sleep in."" The witness stated he arose to check for ""snow"" as the local weather provider had said it was a possibility that night and he wanted to show it to the family.

 This FI having checked the weather report, etc. before my interview, indicating according to the U.S. Naval Observatory Astronomical Department as follows: For the East Dublin area 1/20/08 @ 04:21 AM EST- winds had been out of the NW with gusts up to 20 MPH. There had been rain/sleet over the area for several hours: humidity averaged 81 % .  A severe weather system with lots of lighting activity had moved across Georgia the evening of 1/19/08 and on into 1/20/08. Temperature averaged around 47* F. No snow recorded in the area. But witness indicated there was ice everywhere 1/20/08 Sunrise 1/20/08 was @ 7:32AM/ EST. The Moon was waxing  Gibeous with a (95% disk surface showing/ illuminated and was 2 days before full which set at the ""exact"" time of 05:58 AM that morning 1/20/08(Thanks to MUFON ASD GA. MARK AUSMUS for exact moon charts) Charts on file. Witness said the sky was clear at the time of the sighting.

 Please note that the lack of animal activity (barking of dogs) that the witness originally reported as unusual does not seem to this FI to be in anyway connected to the sighting as most family yard dogs would be bedded down after such a weather system that lasted around 12 hours  and 2 hours before sunrise.

 Nothing appears unusual of this time frame(at this time) and the witness remembers seeing the exact time of 05:58 AM on the DVD player near the front door from which the sighting took place, which he showed me.

The witness had viewed the object as he looked out of the decorative glass, front door panel, noticed the lights and opened the door.

 Recapping ( again) the sighting as recorded in the original report to NUFORC, I had the witness go over the statement about the size estimate . I discovered that what he actually saw were 3 large, bright red/orange lights encapsulated inside a half ""dome"" shape, rounded part to the top, and the 3 lights were inside, tapered back from the bottom to the top as if they were  3 panels of light. The panels of light appeared ""fire like"" the sun, rather than pulsating. Estimating the size of the object by the witness was based on a neighbors house approximately ? mile West on his road. I had him do a measure at arms length exercise and we determined the object to be 1 ? inches to 2 inches at arms length. This FI using www.ufotools.com their website calculations estimated the size at a ground distance of approx. 5000ft.(1524 m) at an angle of elevation 10 degress based on the terrain lay-out from the witness? front porch at eye level. The estimated length of the object at the base of the ?  dome was approx.93.624 ft.(28 m). The altitude estimate was 882 ft (269m). FYI/ this FI is comfortable with the distant from the witness calculation of 93 ft. due to the fact the object could have been as close as ? mile and as far as 1 mile due to the angle in which it was viewed across various landscape/terrain. There was no way to get an exact measurement from either side of the objects landing area. One being a neighbor?s yard that the witness didn?t want me to contact and the inaccessible swamp on the  other .

The entire time period of the actual event was 7 to 8 minutes.

Google maps of the location will follow at a later date.

 Next the witness took me outside to show the exact location ( again) where he saw the object and where his wife joined him on the porch. The direction was North, North West,  as originally reported. It was NNW across the open area over the subdivision at approximately 3/4/ to 1 mile (approx. 5000ft) distance according to my compass readings and previous drive through observations. If the object had been floating down behind the ridge line off the other road north of the location, it would not have lit up the trees, like the witness stated to this FI, and it did light up trees located closer to a small pond located on the North West side of the subdivision. It appeared to come down behind the silhouette of one specific, large pine tree near the pond about ? mile away but the distance  of the object was probably closer to a 3/4  to 1 mile away in the swamp land. The witness stated that the object maneuvered ""blimp like,"" moving very slowly and drifting down from about an 80 degree flat , right to left angle above the large pine tree and there was sky line well below the object estimated at about 100 to 150 feet above the large pine tree. Again, I wish to emphasize, as this FI viewed the exact angle of the object?s dissent seen by the witness, it would have had to go down in front of the ridge line located on  the  other road to the West , not behind it. Again, this ridge is  approx. 1.5 miles from the residence and an astronomical object would have went down behind the ridge.

That would put the object going down into the swamp off the Western border road.

I next spoke to the second witness, the wife, by phone at her place of business and her description was as the original report, but reiterated that ""It looked like the Sun going down at Sunset.""

I asked if she had noticed anything unusual since the sighting. She stated that their house lights had been surging up and down over that day and a few days following. At this phone interview (on speaker phone) her husband recalled with her that the automatic, dawn to dusk, mercury vapor light in the driveway had gone out as well during that time and had not come back on. This driveway light has sense been repaired and both bulb and sensor had to be replaced. The witness also remembered at this time that he had been having all the rechargeable batteries in their cell phones, remote keyboard to his business computer and the children?s electronic toys in his home office being drained of their charges. He would charge them up and next day they would be discharged. This FI after returning to Savannah discovered that my brand new camera?s batteries were completely drained and I had put new ones in that morning before leaving for East Dublin. Coincidence? Maybe! Witness had also noticed an  intermittent  humming sensation/noise  in his and his wife?s ears for 3 weeks after the sighting.

I had the witness file a formal complaint with the Georgia Power Company and at first the customer service representative said that they are not able to look up  previous  power problems. Instead they did a new report on the fact that witness was experiencing humming noise and ""possible power surges sense the 19th-20th through the end of January 08. No mention was made of the battery drainage to Georgia Power Company. A Ga. Power technician was dispatched to the residence that day. The witness inquired if they could explain the humming sensations and the power fluctuations, or any other problems for that time period.  The Technician?s log book indicated that 2 power sub-stations went out between January 20th and 21st, in the area. He unlocked the house?s power meter and did a few tests inside the meter ands stated it was working fine. The humming noise was not detected and the technician could only say that what had been happening must have been caused by the 2 downed sub-stations . The  GP Technician could give no explaination for the substations failures. At this writing the only problem electrically , seems to be the continual drain of freshly charged batteries in the home. This FI nor the witness can figure this out at this time.

 This FI first speculated that the witnesses may have seen the ""Moon set"" as it did in fact set at exactly the same moment the object seemed to land in the swamp. However, the Moon set in a wooded area directly ""behind"" the residence and was about 90 degrees in the opposite direction in the West South Westerly location at the time of the sighting.

The witness stated that the object never rose up after 1 hour . After approximately 30 minutes of waiting for the object to rise , a meteor, which the witness described as normal except that it was very short in duration with only a very short trajectory of about 1 to 2 inches at arms length appearing. They speculated that they felt it was connected in some way with the object. This FI does not.

 As the witness? children arrived from school on the day of the interview/investigation, he introduced me to them and I interviewed them briefly. They had not seen anything, but knew all about the details. The  daughter had had a ""nightmare"" about seeing the lights similar to what her parent?s had described and had drawn a picture (on file) of the object. She slept with her parent?s that night.

This FI does not believe this was a ""recall"" experience by the child but simply that this incident has impacted this family in a stressful and negative way.

 The witness claims to have a high IQ and so does his  son. The witness has been troubled over the fact that he cannot reconcile what he saw with what he knows to be normal and logical, He has stated to this FI that it affected him as he has become protective and concerned for the families safety more than usual.

This FI believes  the daughter has seen and heard her parent?s attempts to explain the incident and became fearful.  I told the witness to consider playing down the incident to help his daughter overcome her initial fears. He agreed.

 This FI has 35 years experience as a professional clinical counselor and 27 years as a Christian Pastor and I can say with some certain knowledge that the witnesses (husband & wife) have experienced something that has disturbed their normal life in a dramatic way and this disturbance has spilled over to their children. I have checked back once per week with the witness as of this writing and they are still trying to figure out what they saw.

 UFO TOOLS website gives this case with the evidence available at a 57.5% reliability, strangeness 14.29%, info quality 10%, certainty 00.82% Valle classification is FB1 possibly FB2 considering the electrical circumstantial evidence.

The probability of the object being a plasma ball  over  the power grid would be highly likely except for the fact that it was first seen moving 100 to 150 feet above the tree line that hides the grid line from line of sight from the witness? front porch. Along with the appearance of being a ""dome or half a circle/sphere with lighted panels , this probability is slim . This FI contacted FI Brion Trainor/ a retired electrical engineer and team member of MUFONGA/ Coastal Georgia and he advised that due to the altitude the object was first seen and it?s coloration , that indeed, a plasma ball was very unlikely.

This FI also personally spoke with all 3 departments of Law Enforcement in Laurens County. East Dublin PD, Dublin PD and Laurens County Sheriff?s Department. None have received any UFO or unusual  aeriel  phenomenon reports as far back as memory serves them. I spoke either to the Chiefs or their Ranking officers and they were very cooperative and want to be contacted in the future regarding any such report and will contact this FI should they receive reports of this nature in their respected departments.

Also this FI has contacted a newspaper reporter to look into any media for that area that may have received reports for the sighting?s time frame of 1/20/08. Any information forth coming will be posted as received.

FYI/ The witness mentioned the reason he made the report was because of another sighting in East Dublin 2 months prior. This incident also was reported to NUFORC on 11/26/2007. The report is similar at first examination and I can see why this witness of 1/20/08 was prompted to file his report.

It was unfortunate that this FI was unable to gain access to the swampy area where the object went down to check for traces of its presence. However, due to the overall evidence of the circumstances and the insistence of the witness to remain anonymous, and the consistency of the testimonies and the adverse affect it had on the them and their children, I conclude at this time that this case should be classified ""unknown."" However, this case will remain open for this FI and contact with these witnesses will continue until I am personally satisfied they have some closure.

I was on the Golden State Freeway (I-5) in Los Angeles, CA heading northbound at approximately 1:40 a.m. on Saturday, 03 May 2008.  The temperature was 59 degrees Fahrenheit; clear skies; 58% humidity; visibility 10 miles (weather.com).  At the 101/I-5 junction in Downtown Los Angeles, I noticed a bright light near the Downtown LA skyline.  As I connected to the 101 freeway junction heading toward the light, I noticed that the light was in fact two (2) lights pointing down.  At first, I believed it to be a police helicopter; however, it appeared to be ?locked? in the same spot, too steady to be hovering.  The almost-golden colored lights were large and close together; reminiscent of heating lights used to keep food warm at a buffet restaurant.  Noticing that there were no vehicles behind me nor ahead of me, I proceeded to slow down to 30 miles per hour (I was initially traveling at 65 mph); at which point I was observing the object above my vehicle slightly to the left, allowing me to see it without the roof of my vehicle obstructing my view.  The object appeared to be at about 700-800 feet in mid-air.

 The shape of the object as viewed from directly underneath resembled the shape of a human eye; almost that of a football.  The lights were pointing down and were definitely not police helicopter lights (of which there is only one per craft; usually unstable and blue-white/halogen type).  Combined, the two lights took up an estimated 70% of the shape in which they were contained.

 The object did not produce any visual/audible means of propulsion.  Its surface did not display any flashing lights, such as those of a police helicopter (flashing blue and red strobes on the sides) or any conventional aircraft.  The surface was dark-metallic.  Thin, fine, vertical and horizontal could barely be seen across its dark surface.  The top or ?side? of the object was not visible, since it was viewed from underneath.

 The area in which it was hovering in is assumed to be restricted airspace for airplanes; both private and commercial due to its proximity to the skyscrapers of the downtown district (less than a mile).  The nearest airport, Los Angeles International is approximately 15 miles southeast of Downtown LA.  Commercial and private airplane routes approaching the Los Angeles Metropolitan area head westbound almost directly above the 105 Freeway, which connects North Orange County/South Los Angeles County to LA International Airport.  This busy and well-known airplane route is approximately 10 miles south of Downtown LA.  It is also viewable 24 hours a day.  Goodyear blimps are known to fly in the area since Dodger Stadium is nearby; however, blimps are not known to display large, exceedingly bright lights.  The object observed was definitely not a blimp; it did not glide or appear to exhibit slight movement.  Dodger Stadium was not hosting any events that evening.

 After reviewing a map of the area, I estimate the object?s position to have been directly above Santa Fe Avenue & 7th Street (near the 7th Street bridge over the LA River) in Downtown LA.

 As I was observing the object from my vehicle (window down, traveling at 30 mph); I glanced ahead quickly to make sure my vehicle was on track before I glanced back to observe the object again.  This went on for about 45 seconds.  As I glanced at the road quickly (about 1 second), I looked back up and the object was gone.  The area of sight in which I had the object in was large enough for me to track a helicopter or an airplane even at high speeds.  As I circled the Downtown LA area via the 101 junction ramp (first northbound, then northwest bound); I scanned the area for the object; however, it was no longer present.

I recently saw a UFO in the last few months near the coast from Daly City at approximately 11:30 pm.  I had been walking to the gas station to buy some food and I stopped to light a cigarette.  Something caught my attention and I looked up to see a chevron shaped object flying north.  The object had several orangish/yellowish lights emanating from the bottom of the craft.  I was quite stunned to say the least.  

The craft seemed to be only a few miles away though I'm not sure of it's altitude, but it was very low.  It's wingspan was one of the more unusual aspects of the sighting as it seemed to be 1 1/2 times the length of a typical commercial jet airliner.  I had headphones in my ears at the time, so I took them out to see if I could hear anything.  It was absolutely silent.  It seemed to be gliding through the air.  I continued to stand and stare for approximately 10 seconds until it flew out of sight.

Thank you for your time.

I must make it quite clear, I never saw any UFO, Alien Life Form, or Supernatural Technology. The connection I have made was in fact a sense.

To begin my story I must start back on the day of May 18th, 2008. It was around 8:30 A.M. on a Sunday and I was suddenly awakened which was unusual because I usually sleep in until noon. Upon waking up, I can?t describe what happened, but I felt something out of place in my house, I got up, and found that my dog who normally slept in a separate room, had been outside my room scratching at the door. This troubled me, so I went back into my room, grab what I determined to be the heaviest, blunt object in my room, (which at the time happened to be my Guitar Hero Gibson) and proceeded down my stairs leading my dog by the collar. I decided to look outside of my house and with dog and guitar in hand, walked outside. When I got outside, my dog immediately took off running, and did not come back for six days.

Out side, I found nothing, and proceeded back into my house, feeling hungry and not in the mood to make myself food; I decided to go to McDonalds and to look for my dog on the way. I did not feel normal until I had left about 20 yards from my house, where I did indeed see my dog, but he would not come when I called him.

All this, albeit out of the ordinary, was nothing to what I would discover in the weeks to come. When I had gone to McDonalds, eaten my food, and come home, I found throughout the day that I was no longer hungry. I had also discovered that my athletic ability, which was already significant, had dramatically increased; my times in the mile dropped from 5.03 to 4.27, and continue to go down, despite my being in the off season for track, and no longer practicing as hard. In the past week alone, I have grown 1/16th of an inch, and in total over the month that followed this event, have grown about an Inch and ?. I only now need to eat one meal a day, and my Vocabulary, Math skills, and Memory have vastly improved, and I dare say they maybe on par with others who have achieved doctorate degrees.

I have noticed similar changes with my dog, which is 16 years old, and has the agility of a puppy. I searched my property and found nothing; similar occurrences have happened with my neighbors, only effects are less impressive than my own. All doctor check outs have found nothing unusual. I will continue to monitor my process as time continues.

The only thing I saw was one very large bright light, the light was as strong as a  halogen light, no noise coming from the UFO.  The bright light was the shape of a perfect shape of a oval.

Report of UFO Siting 3/25/79   

For many years now I have wanted to report this incident which occurred on highway one in Big Sur, California in March 1979 around 8pm. 

Myself and a friend named Jimmy were hiking in the mountains around Big Sur all day and were tired and wanting a place to stay for the night. We stopped at one of the only motels along the road called Lucia in an area which was otherwise quite wild, and asked for a room but for various reasons were not able to stay there so began hiking south on highway 1 to the nearest campground. It was dark and we were very tired but there were no cars and we were walking so we had no choice but to continue. We left the motel (there was a gas station there too) and when we got far enough away from there that there were no more lights visible from the road we had the ocean to our right and the mountains coming right off the road to the left. We noted that any plane or ship passing the area could be heard more clearly as it echoed off the mountains. As we walked we looked out over the ocean and noted a silent triangular amber glowing craft hoovering above the ocean and casting a very large circle of light that appeared like a search light of some sort. We immediately realized that it was not from Earth. As we watched it began a lateral ascent, parallel with the shore and it dropped something amber glowing into the ocean. At that point it began leaving a phosphorescent trail of light resembling a jet stream behind it and then a few seconds later it dropped another glowing object into the ocean and continued to move slowly upward in a linear rise while still trailing the phosphorescent light. It was moving slowly and appeared to be about 1/2-1 mile out on the ocean.  Abruptly, it turned left and shot into space. My friend through up his arms and yelled ?Wait! Take me with you!? at which point from a tiny yellow star in the night sky it sent back two phosphorescent beams of light that started out as superimposed triangles which came straight at us where we were standing and eventually stop! ped as a formation hoovering over the water near shore and reflecting in the ocean below us. We both agreed that the formation resembled a vertebrae if you were looking down a spinal cord. It had a black hole in the middle of it and 3 spines coming off of it like a vertebrae. That light stayed in the air for about 10 min. before disappating. The jetstreams were there even longer. We were entirely energized by the experience which has forever changed my view of the world. I had reported the incident to the local paper in Santa Cruz, California the day after it happened to see if anyone else had reported such a siting and it was published in the paper which I didn't realize until I was sitting several days later on the beach covered with poison oak from the hike we did there and I was approached by a guy on the beach who asked me where I got the  poison oak. I told him Big Sur and he told me about the article. He said he had lived at he campground where we slept that night and that there were all sorts of strange lights coming from behind the mountains there but when they would try to approach them, they would meet with force fields that would make it impossible for them to get closer. He felt certain also that there were very strange things going on there and wasn't surprised to hear our story.

 I have this incident documented in a journal which is why the dates are so clear but the memory is as clear as though I saw it a minute ago. I have never heard of another encounter like this one. It definitely felt as though they knew we were there and that the light show at the end was for us. It was utterly spectacular. With all recent crop circles coming around the world, I have become very interested in becoming a part of the movement to understand and/or communicate with whatever is doing this. I feel that they are studying us like we study animal life on our own planet. We are primitive to them and they are being careful not to come on too strong, just giving us beautiful crop art and occasional sitings of their otherwise invisible craft. I heard recently that we have learned how to make things invisible and that this was learned through alien technology. I want to know more about this. How involved are you with the crop circle phenomena as it relates to the UFO sitings? Is there any way I can help with this? Please contact me.

((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax?  PD))","WHILE ME AND MY NEIGHBOR FRIENDS WERE JUST SHOOTING THE BULL AND WERE HANGING OUT WE SAW SOME EXITING UFO.

On Tuesday, November 22, 2005 at 7.40 P.M. I was at a nearby neighbors house with some friends we were out in the backyard on the patio. We were grilling barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken, and steaks on the outdoor grills out in the backyard. We looked up and saw 3 circle UFOS. On the inside of the bottom they had red, yellow, and green lights then red, yellow, and purple lights then they were a roquefort blue (what I mean by a roquefort blue they looked like roquefort and blue cheese salad dressing the lights on the inside of the bottom looked like blue cheese salad dressing) they were still roquefort blue then on the inside of the bottom they had red and orange lights mainly red lights then again red, yellow, and green lights and emitted orange beams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Then 3 triangler UFOS showed up they were purple lighted with red dots on the corners and emitted pink beams. Then the 3 circle UFOS had red, yellow, and pink lights on the inside of the bottom then red, yellow and purple lights then red, yellow and green lights. Then as we were still grilling our food barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken, and steaks on the outdoor grills out in the back yard. The 3 circle UFOS on the inside of the bottom one of them had red, yellow, and green lights the other one red, yellow, and purple lights and the one red, yellow, and pink lights and the 3 triangler UFOS were had roquefort blue lights with red dots on the corners.                                                                                                                                                                  
They all hovered over the treetops in the backyard as we were grilling our food barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken, and steaks on the outdoor grills in the backyard and we were drinking COKES AND DR! . PEPPER S as we watched the UFOS hover over the backyard. Then all 3 circle UFOS on the inside of the bottom had red, yellow, and oranger lights then red, yellow, and pink lights then all blue lights on the inside of the bottom then all 3 circle UFOS on the inside of the bottom had red, yellow, and green lights then red, yellow, and purple lights then red and orange lights mainly red lights then again on the inside of the bottom red, yellow, and purple lights then red, yellow, and green lights and emitted orange beams then the 3 triangler UFOS were yellow lighted wit red dots on the corners. and emitted purple beams. Then all 3 circle UFOS and the triangler UFOS were all white lighted. The 3 circle UFOS on the inside of the bottom were all white lighted and the 3 triangler UFOS were all white lighted with no dots on the corners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Then all 6 UFOS the 3 circle UFOS and the 3 triangler UFOS all disappeared and we saw them no more they were going towards the ocean to folley beach I guess they crashed out in the ocean. We saw all of this as we were grilling our food barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken, and steaks on the outdoor grills out in the backyard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Then as we were still grilling our food on the outdoor grills out in the backyard 2 huge cone UFOS showed up the were red on top and yellow on bottom then red on top and purple on bottom then they disappeard they disappeard as fast as they came going towards the ocean and probally crashed in the ocean. Then 2 rectangler UFOS showed up they were blue lighted and then red lighted and emitted! purple and yellow beams. Then 2 diamond UFOS showed up they were a gold color. Then as we were still grilling barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken, and steaks on the outdoor grills in the backyard our food a huge chest UFO showed up it had colors of red, yellow, green, purple, blue, orange, roquefort blue, pink, white, black, and gray on it. And it hovered all over the backyard and emitted orange and roquefort blue beams and then disappeared going. All the UFOS cone, rectangler, diamond, and chest UFO were going towards folley beach I guess they all crashed out in the ocean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Then a circle UFO showed up on the inside of the bottom it had red, yellow, and purple lights and emitted orange beams the red, yellow, and green lights and emitted orange beams then on the inside of the bottom all blue lights then red and orange lights mainly red lights then again red, yellow and green lights and emitted orange beams. Then it was all white lighted on the inside of the bottom it had all white lights and disappeard it probally crashed out in the ocean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Then 3 more triangler UFOS showed up they were all pink lighted with red dots on the corners and emitted blue and purple beams then they were blue lighted with red dots on the corners and made a whistling sound and disappeard going to folley beach to crash in the ocean. Then 2 more triangler UFOS showed up they were green lighted with yellow dots on the corners they made a whistling sound then they were all white lighted with no dots on the corners then they disappeard going towards the ocean to! folley beach I guess they crashed out in the ocean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Then we were all done grilling our food the barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken, and steaks we grilled on the outdoor grills out in the backyard as we were watching all these UFOS we saw that night. We saw no more UFOS and we took our food in the grilled on the outdoor grills out in the backyard and got ready to eat it. It was really fun to be with my neighbor friends being together and seeing the UFOS we saw it was a very clear night outside and we saw no more UFOS. It was really an exiting experience to see all the UFOS we saw when we were all in the backyard grilling food and we were all together. We just couldn't believe all the UFOS we saw when we were all together.

I was riding in the backseat of a friend?s vehicle (2 in front, 3 in the rear) traveling north on Pioneer Blvd, specifically to go to McDonald?s. We turned west onto the small street on the south side of the McDonald?s. I recall, very vividly, the object was  a matte black disc with small orange ?flames? around its edge, coming from the west, from say Lakewood or Long Beach (one would expect to see the Lakewood Sheriff station?s helicopter on a similar path) with silence. It was around late dusk and I recall remembering the event later and the fact that we seemed to have returned to my friend?s home minus any McDonald's food, no need to discuss the object, and hearing about John Lennon?s murder that evening , which helped me date the event. I make no abduction claims at all, just the sighting, but feel a distinct loss of time from the moment the object was passing over and being back in the TV den at my friend?s house. The street and parking lot, hence the restaurant, was busy when the sighting occurred.

On October 30, 2008 I was driving up into Palos Verdes, CA, on Palos Verdes Blvd. coming from Redondo Beach, CA at approximately 7:50 PM to pick up some food I ordered. When I got up into the beginning area of Palos Verdes just passing the shopping center on my left I saw a circular object, straight ahead and slightly to my right that had a tube ring of light that wrapped around its perimeter.

The best way to describe this light was if you were to take a straight tube fluorescent bulb and bend it to wrap around into a circle. This was around the perimeter of the object and was glowing powerfully, with a slight blue hue to it. There was also a square shaped lighting tube that was off to one side of the object that was the same color and intersected with the round shaped tube of light but was much smaller in overall size in comparison. The second I had caught view of the object it had made a very quick, smooth flight pattern that I would say was a 60-70 degree angle straight upward in the sky but still in my view. The instant I saw this I couldn?t believe what I was seeing because it was so close. I could easily say it was less than 1000 yards away at its farthest point during my sighting. As I saw the object make that quick flight pattern, I was continuing to drive straight when I glanced to my right to see a couple that was off the side of the road, standing beside their car, already trying to take pictures of the craft. I thought, ?my god they are seeing it too and who knows for how long before me.?  	 After stopping at a stop sign immediately after and continuing to drive forward I see the craft lowering itself from the point it had stopped from the previous flight pattern. I then pull over the side of the rode where there are houses lined on the street. My eyes are staying focused on the object the whole time. I?m staring at this craft object through my windshield off to my right which is slowly lowering itself while making a flight pattern quite strange. I get out of my car trying not to loose even a second of looking at the object. The craft is swaying back and forth from right to left, to left to right. Then it begins to simply lower straight down very slowly and smooth until it is out of vision, below the elevated plateau I?m standing on. The area it was flying over and eventually lowering itself was over the ocean as Palos Verdes is a town with several layers of elevated plateaus and oceanside cliffs.

I then quickly get back in my car to turn around to see if the couple I saw was still there but they weren?t. I?m not sure if they would have seen the lower flight pattern it took  because from their position you can?t see over the ocean and there are trees that possibly blocked their vision from their angle of view. I then try to drive down to a lower area to see if the craft was still hanging around beyond where I could see. I got down very close to the ocean, cliffside, but I saw nothing. The object was gone.

I was completely baffled and couldn?t believe what I had seen. The fact that it was so close and could see it so clearly felt unreal to me. I tried to rationalize during and after the sighting what it could have been. There was only one thing I could come up with other than it being some ?other worldly? craft. I thought maybe some talented guys had built a circular, remote controlled craft and were flying it. I then thought that this was not likely true because the lighting of the craft was simply too magnificent and the craft likely too large. That powerfully glowing tube of light around the perimeter was a light like I?ve never seen before. The couple that was taking pictures must have been awed enough to stop and take pictures. Also, that beginning flight pattern of the craft shooting straight upward at a 60-70 degree angle was too fast. Conclusions I came to were as follows:  - This was a ?flying craft? of some sort that was being ?controlled? somehow.

- The object was obviously circular shaped - I have NEVER seen anything like this - The size of the object was estimated to be about the size of a car or larger considering the relation to the landscape and how close I it was to me.

- The craft made no sound that I could here.

I will never forget what I saw. I would love more than anything to know exactly what it was. I feel strange that I saw this so close to me. It was not just some point of light in the distance. I don?t know what to do with my experience as it was so ?baffling? and feel incredibly unsettled about it. The thing I?m most intrigued about was the lighting. I?m not a 100% believer in UFOs and this lighting was like nothing I?ve ever personally heard reported in peoples sightings.","Natural Medicine practitioner and owner of herbal medicine company",0,1,"circle",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2008,2000,4,10,19,"Evening","West",1,0,1,0,0

It was sometime in August 2000.  I am a drummer and had just packed up my gear and was heading home.  We had played at a place called ?Rosie?s? in Harrington.  I lived in Wilbur Washington. I have not drank nor done drugs since May 28th, 1998.  I have a full time day job, music is my hobby.

It was about 2:30am and I was traveling toward Hiway 20 ((sic.  Route 2)) on a back road from Harrington that comes out by the power transformer station (I guess that?s what it is) onto Hiway 20 west of the Davenport Refuse Transfer Station.  I think the back road is called Rocklyn Road.

I was in my Ford van which had a big windshield.  I glanced out the driver side window and noticed a huge jet black triangle shaped object outlined against the clear night sky.  It had one small red light in the very center.  This red light did not blink.  This object was moving very slow towards Spokane, Washington.  I pulled over to get a better look.  Even though it was dark out, I could distinctly see this object.  It was huge.  About 300 feet long, maybe 200 feet across the back.  The sides went straight up about 40 feet.  I rolled down my window (I did not get out of the van because I was pretty freaked out by now) and it made absolutely no sound.  I sat and watched as it slowly passed in front of my van.  It was about 200-300 feet off the ground.  It took about 15 minutes to pass in front of me if that tells you how slow it was moving.

As it passed my van I saw 5 very big square lights across the back of it.  They spanned the full width across the back as well as went almost from the top to bottom of the object.  I am absolutely sure there were five lights because there was a dark line between each of them.  These lights were intensely bright.  Even though they were bright, they didn?t seem to give off light outside the object itself.  They didn?t seem to light anything up.  I thought to myself, ""Llights that bright should throw some light onto the ground,""  but they didn?t.  

I watched as it silently disappeared from my view.  My heart was pounding and I was scared to death.  The next day I told some friends.  They immediately told me I was seeing things.  I know what I saw.  I have no reason to make up story like this.  I don?t care if anybody believes me or not.  I know what I saw.  I will never forget it.  I was going to send this report in several years ago, but could never get myself to push the send button.  Seeing  that you are now located at Davenport, I thought if nothing else you should know.




((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))

Hi Peter.
 
It's hard to pinpoint where I actually was that night because of the darkness.  I was probably 5-6 miles out of Harrington heading toward hiway 20.  ((sic.  Route 2))   I know I had passed where there is a Y in the road.   For the life of me I can't remember how long it was untill I came upon one of the old farm houses after I watched it.  Like I said I was very freaked out by then.  We usually played every other weekend at Rosies.  We always played the first and third weekend of the month.  My best guess would be August 19, 2000.  Rosies has closed since then but I could talk to to the other band members and see if they remember the exact date.
 
I kept running it through my mind the rest of the way home and do not remember much of the surroundings after that.  I kept asking myself things like ""could it have been a helecopter?""  Then I would remind myself just how big this thing was and how it made no noise.  So then I thought maybe a balloon.  Again, it was so big and so quiet with absolutely no blinking warning lights, just the small red light on the bottom in the center.  I ruled out balloon.  Maybe a big plane from fairchild?  It would have fallen out of the sky it was moving so slow. 
 
I have always had this missconception that UFO's were round, saucer shaped objects.  That UFO's darted about then hovered, then darted about some more.  This did not fit that category at all. In my wildest dreams I would never have thought of them as being triangle shaped.  I always thought of them as being lit up with multicolored lights.  Again, only the small red light and the 5 sqaure lights across the back.  This object was totally black.  No lights on the sides.  I thought they would make humming or whirring sounds.  There was complete silence.
 
I kept questioning myself about the 5 lights across the back.  They did not fit the norm for lights that bright.  If you were to look at 2 bright headlights that are 2-3 feet apart, you would see two distinct bright points of light.  The light from those two headlights would join at a distance and you would probably not be able to see a distinct gap between them unless you were standing right next to them. From a distance they would blend together.  The gaps between the 5 bright lights on this object were very distinct.  Even at a distance.  The light formed definite edges that were perfectly straight.  I mentioned in my letter to you that they were square.  Actually they were more rectangular.  Taller than they were wide.
 
I am 51 years old and have never in my life seen anything that even remotely resembled what I saw that night.  It defied all logic.  The only thing that could move that slow and stay in the air would be a balloon.  This was not a balloon.  I can not tell you exactly how big it was because I had no reference points.  In the darkness I could not see buildings or trees, just the outline of the hills.  I can tell you that my Ford Van was a 1989 E250 Custom van.  It had a big front windshield and that at one point this object completely filled it.  This object was probably 400-600 feet directly in front of me and 200-300 feet off the ground at that moment.  It was very, very big.
 
This expierience has changed the way I think. I don't take things for granted anymore.  I don't believe that just because the Theory of Relativity states we can not travel  faster than the speed of light, we can't travel faster the speed of light.  I am full of ""What If's and Why's""  What if we simply do not have a calculation that would prove that theory wrong?  What if a life form millions of years older than ourselves had the capability to travel through space at speeds we can't begin to imagine?  Only 500 years ago people would have said you were crazy to think it possible to talk to someone  5000 miles away instantly in real time.  Why do scientist's and engineers continue to develop ways to travel faster if it's not possible to travel faster than the speed of light?  Even at the speed of light things are simply so far away it would do us no good.  I believe they are hoping the Theory of Reletivity is also wrong. The universe is huge. Just because we can't do it, does not mean another  much older inteligent life form can't. 
 
As humans I believe now that we are self centered and very, very small in the grand scheme of things. I believe that we have conditioned ourselves to think if we can't do it, it can't be done.  I believe if we can imagine it, eventually it will be done.  I also believe something, a life form or entity, whatever, just beat us to it.
 
As I stated, I don't care if anybody believes me.  I know what I saw and nobady will ever convince me otherwise.  I know in my heart that the object I saw that night, was NOT from this planet.  As for my credibility... take a drive to Wilbur, go into Sandy's family foods.  I worked there 10 years as a shift supervisor, ask them.  Everybody in Wilbur knows me.  I am not a publicity seeker and have nothing to gain by making up a story such as this.  I have palyed music proffesionally for over 30 years and have had all the publicity a person would ever want.  My wife and I are very private people, almost to point of being hermits.  I just wanted you to know what I had seen in your area.  I will draw you a picture of what I saw if you would like and attach it to an email.

We were walking home just after midnight from grabbing some food and I saw a very bright orange light.  And I turned to my boyfriend and pointed it out to him.  Him being so skeptical, I thought he was going to dismiss what I was seeing, but he looked up and said, ""what is that?"".  We both agreed it was not a plane or like anything we have ever seen before.   I am pretty positive it wasnt a plane because planes have red or white lights flashing and are always flying over head as we live near 2 major aiports; and seeing so many, this was in no way a plane.  The light was very bright, large and orange in color, wierd in shape (fireball-ish?), like nothing I've seen before. As we stared we noticed that the orange light was very bright and large for being a distance away. It was heading Northwest to Southeast, towards us. The first one stopped, stood still or hovered for more than a few seconds and then headed west. There was a second one behind it, just as bright orange as the first. It was coming from the same direction. It stopped and was hovering. It pulsed as did the first one when it was hovering, almost to the point of dissapperance. It did a small square flight pattern(looked very unatural), and headed west(was out of site pretty quickly once heading west-within 3-4 seconds). The duration was about 2 min and there was absolutely no sound whatsoever associated w/ the objects. My boyfriend is very skeptical, but he said it was like nothing he has ever seen before. The color was just such a bright rich orange color and the flight pattern was very akward. I have no idea what it was, I just know it was a first that I have seen something like this.","Operations-Hedge Fund",2,2,"fireball",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2009,2000,1,1,0,"Night","West",1,0,0,0,0

I was on the fourth floor of Valley Fair mall in the early morning and was watching the usual government chemtrail's killing us on a daily basis, that's when I noticed a small orb or sphere that could maybe fit a single person in it. It was about 200 to 300 yards away I have more than perfect 20/20 vision I can see perfect far and close. I noticed the chemtrail coming out of the back of the plane when the orb appeared and did three full circles around the chemtrail itself and then flew to the very end of the chemtrail and back to the very front of the chemtrail right behind the plane. After that it quickly broke away from the chemtrail and flew towards Valley Fair mall about maybe 50 to 100 yards closer. It then did a sudden sharp turn and seemed to slowly and leisurely fly toward the Mount Hamilton area and disappeared. The orb was silver and smooth I could not see any widows, lights, markings, or contrails coming from it.

Yes there were indeed lights in the sky last night. My husband, I and two boys had to run to Brownwood last night from Bangs to get something to eat at a local fast food chain. My husband waited in the car while the boys and I ran inside to place a order. When we came out to the car, my husband said look there are lights in the sky, it looks like a UFO. I said yea right..He said no really, look over there. I looked up and noticed the most amazing thing. The lights appeared and vanished. Then further away, they appeared and vanished again. I was totally shocked. My boys noticed the lights as well. My husband said that while we were inside the fast food chain, he had saw the lights first appear over Walmart, and it did the same pattern 3 times while we were inside. The appearing and then vanishing on 3 different occasions. I could not believe what I was seeing, because I am normally a very skeptical person, and I saw it with my own eyes. The first time I noticed the lights they were between Home Depot and Walmart, and the second time I saw them they were over the Home Depot store. We tried to drive back behind the store in the direction that the lights were headed, but did not see them again...My son tried to record the lights on his cell phone, but the guard lights around Home Depot was putting a glare on his phone. I just wanted to respond to this, because I know that I saw them, and I am so glad someone came forward to talk about this. I had told my husband last night, to contact someone, but he said no one would believe the story without pictures. I am convinced there was something going on last night.

My daughter was driving us to a drive-in fast food chain for dinner after we were moving her into an apartment on the east / northeast side of Louisville, Kentucky.

I looked to my right from the passenger seat and viewed what i thought a balloon someone had just let loose. The sun had set and the sky was almost dark but still had a slight glow to the sky. The balloon object; no lights,  was flying away from my position like a knuckle ball at about the 2:00 o'clock position, but the wind was blowing into my face from the north. Than without a noise, the balloon object went straight up about 12:00 o'clock position, dove straight down to the left, came right at us over another fast food place and grew to about 10'-14' in diameter.

I told my daughter to look at the object when i pointed over the buildings horizon. She saw the tear dropped balloon looking object and within a second it darted up and out to the left and was gone in 1 sec. It shrank in size as if traveling at a very very high rate of speed. Again no noise.

If it were a balloon, how could the balloon travel seem to go against the wind about 1/4 mile and hover perfectly still, move again very quickly, hover, and take off like it was shot out of cannon?

My dates are not exact, I apologize for that, but I can narrow it down to a 3 year window when my oldest daughter was 12-15 years old, she will be 23 this year. This sighting occured between approximately 6-7 pm, in broad daylight, as I was stopped at the stoplight on Hwy 50 (in front of Wal Mart and across the Hwy from East Central College), several cars in front of me, several behind me. I was Eastbound headed toward I-44, and while stopped at the light, I noticed the cars stopped Westbound, looking at something to my left. I looked to my left, I remember having to turn my head quite far - practically over my left shoulder, and hovering approximately 20 ft over the trees was a massive object. The exact location at the time had a large barn and silo on it, but is now a strip mall of shops - directly west (to the left if you are facing the front of it) of wal mart.

The object appeared to be 20+ feet high, 50 to 60 feet wide, and it was matte mettalic looking, grey/silver in color. Solid in appearance, with no distinguishable lights or windows. The object appeared to be motionless, and made no audible sound that we could hear. The best way to give a visual is this: Take a stainless steel dogs food/water bowl, and turn it upside down. This hovering object was wider at the top, slightly narrower at the bottom.

As I recall, it took several seconds for my brain to process what I was seeing, as it wasn't necessarily scary looking, it was more of a ""what the ****?"" reaction, more alarmed than frightened. I turned to look at my daughter in the front passenger seat - she was leaning forward and towards me, looking out my driver side window at the object, with her mouth hanging open. I remember saying ""you see it too?"", to which she replied with a nod of her head indicating ""Yes"". I had the presence of mind to glance around at the other vehicles, the traffic light had turned green and no one moved, we were all looking at the object. I looked back at the object and stared at it for what seemed like maybe 1 minute more, and I promise as God is my witness, it ""disappeared"".  My daughter's interpretation of it is the same. One second it was there, and the next, gone. No dramatic flight at high speed was witnessed, just the analogy that it seemed to vanish in the blink of an eye.

The craziest thing of all, looking back on it now, is that there had to be at least 6 cars that I noticed, whose occupants were looking at the same thing we were, and none of us acknowledged to each other what we had just seen. I checked the local newspapers for months after the incident, hoping for some validation, but could find none. My husband said that if I wouldn't report it out of fear of being labeled a psycho-nutcase, what made me think anyone else would report it? He had a point. Anyway, I plan on checking back here from time to time, to see if anyone else comes forward.

I would like to point out that I see that there IS another report on here that sounds like a family saw the same type of object in almost the exact location, except their experience occured in 2004. I held my breath when I saw ""Union"" and ""Wal Mart""! I hope more people ""google"" their experience, as I just did, and find this site. After all of these years, reading about the other Union Wal Mart sighting report gives me the validation that I have been searching for, for many years. THANK YOU!!

I was sitting on the couch watching food network at 8:00pm on a Thursday night, I looked towards my neighbor?s house through my first floor window.  I was too bright and low to be a star and there was many lights grouped together I thought that was weird.  Then I had noticed it had started to rise like it was almost hovering over my neighbor?s house.  I had noted to my mom there was something like a plane in the sky she didn?t seem to care so I checked it out myself.

At first I ran to the window and watched it move slowly over the trees until I couldn?t see it any more.  At this point I ran outside to my porch to get a better look.  It flew lower than an average plane and was quite quiet.  It had the high drone like that of a jet, but again it wasn?t loud my mom noted that she couldn?t hear it while she was inside.  I have helicopters that come over my house that transport people from hospital to hospital and they fly pretty low but not that low and are considerably noisy.

As I watched it come over my house I noted that its bottom was in the shape of a diamond, and there were four white lights, one in each corner.  The light at the tail end was flashing a white while there was two smaller lights on either side.  Once it was more in front of me it looked liked the top of it was like a balloon, it was like the jiffy pop popcorn the kind that you put on the stove and watch it puff up.

It took around two minutes to pass from my neighbor?s house till it was out of my side.  It moved to the North West, West coming from the North East.","Student",1,1,"diamond",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2009,2000,1,2,20,"Evening","Northeast",1,0,0,0,0

At 1st I thought it was a plane until I noticed a similar set of lights underneath at an angle.  They appeared to hover and then go back and forth.  This was strange and no typical of a plane.  

I took my new G1 phone and tried to take a picturng fore.  It was dificult since not best camera. After taking several pictures, I spent some time looking  for the phone case.  

When I realized it was getting late, I decided not to go to the store,but get something to eat.But the place I wanted to go on the other side of the shopping center was closed so it mus thave been after 9 by then. I got back into my car and headed in other direction on route 1 to go to a fast food  place.  

I went to drive in window got my stuff and started heading back in western direction on US 1 south to 95 s toward my development.  It was now at least 20-25 minutes since I first saw the lights.  When I pulled in my devlopement Hopewell, NJ, the lights appeared closer. (Apparently, the sighting in the shopping center was at greater distance and the object(s) were actually closer to my home.) 

When I pulled in my driveway, I again took pictures.  When I looked at them I coulnt see any thing on the shopping center photos due to the distance.  But 2 taken from my front yard show a bomber range or v-shaped object.

On Saturday, April 18th 2009, at about 23:50 the previous day,me and three other friends decided we were hungry.  We decided to go to the local Sonic fast food restaurant and get something to eat. We got there at 00:00, and the employees told us that they were closed for the night. Well, one of my friends knew one of the employees.  So we decided to wait for her to clock out. She came out shortly after, at 00:03.

We were all standing in the parking lot by the highway and talking.  I heard a noise of something that sounded like a distant airplane. Not too distant, but one that sounded like it might be close. I looked directly up, waited a second for my eyes to adjust to the darkness of the sky.  When they finally focused I saw what was dimmer than the brightest star (not including our sun) moving around at a great speed. It was quite small, this could have been because it was quite high in the sky, higher than most airplanes it seemed.  It seemed to be somewhat triangular in shape.  I watched it for a second, and it quickly started making sharp turns left and right, while still going at that same constant speed. It didn?t look like it was getting any closer. The first thing I thought was it was a bug flying around, but there was no way it would be that visible at this time of night.

I told everyone and two of my other friends saw it, even one with glasses on.  The other friend, and the person we were waiting for to get off work didn?t see it.  The employee thought that we were smoking something that night, but that was defenetaly not the case.  I watched it for a good while, almost a minute, as it make incredible turns at such a high speed.  This thing could not have been man made. If it were, not many people know about it.

I finally looked away for one second to ask how my friend and the employee could not see the UFO. And when I looked back it zoomed off.  I didn?t see if it went off somewhere else or if it just went straight up and left the Earth?s atmosphere.  And just as fast as it was gone, so was the quiet noise it was making while it was flying directly above us.  I kept looking around hoping to find it, and I couldn?t. My other two friends that witnessed it also could not find it.

i was in my 3rd year of residency at that time. while reading for a test up in the resident's room around 11:30 am i looked up at the window, and saw a gray colored pipe-like object(cigar shaped) at about 2000 to 2500 feet from the 12th floor of the hospital where i was. this was approximately over a key foods supermarket or a little more distant from the site. it was stationary and did not look like a balloon. it must have been about the length of three fighters end to end from that distance, as far as i can surmise, but slender. i could make out small angular projections around the right one-third of the object taking my right side as a reference. i did not see any transparent areas or lights. i could hear no sound. since i was reading for a test, i could not give any more attention to this stationary object, unfortunately. i looked down to read a few lines and when i looked up in about 10 to 15 seconds or so(due to curiosity as to what it was) it was no longer there! in my opinion it wasn't a balloon, or a conventional aircraft. i recounted it excitedly to my wife when i got back in the evening. i have not forgotten the brief sighting after all these years, and wrote about it briefly to some organization working with texas division of mufon, after a few years, and got an e-mail saying that it would be relayed to mufon head in texas or something like that. i did not have any further contacts after that and did not know to report it to national center for ufo reporting at that time. some of the pictures that i have seen of cigar shaped objects in ufo documentaries look very much like what i saw. it is very much in my memory bank.

I was pulling into the parking lot of my school with a friend. We had just gotten ourselves food and within five minutes of parking I look to the left of us in the sky. The object at first seemed to be a star, it was dusk so I generally tend to look out at the sky. I notice this increidbyl bright ""star"". I tell my friend to look at it and he too thinks its abnormally bright. The object then begins to dim to the point where we can barely see its there, then immediately it gets bright again.

I would say this happened for about 5 minutes or so when to the left another one appears and begins to do the same thing. Now a lot of people said to me that it was a helicopter or a satellite. I have never seen a helicopter flash so brightly and then another just appear, and satellites move across the sky very fast. Anyways the two pulse for about a minute then completely disappear. Since then I hav'nt seen anything like it or heard of anything like it.

The very low lying storm clouds were up against this part of the Moosic Mountain and the Orange Ball glowed through the light gray dense type atmosphere descending floating downwardly like a parachute.

My first thought was that it was an approaching plane going into the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre International Airport after clearing the Omni Guidance Tower atop Archbald's Salem Road Mountain Top [elev 2200'], but that the Orange Ball was  under 2000' elevation too low for normally approaching aircraft! I approached me from the East as I awaited it to change course to the South West, the norm, as it never did I suddenly realized it was something different! The clock was 9:14 Luppini time, only found in Jessup, PA.

After stopping for the Stop sign, I traveled about 600 feet and pulled off the road just as another car passed me. I was across from an inspection station garage.

I got out of the car as the Orange Ball was descending toward the ball park's high tension power lines that cut right through the middle of the complex three fields plus.

I could hear an electronic type crackling noise very similar to a continuous mosquito zapper as it approached closer in the near still quiet! A sliver in the clouds opened up leaving me with a clear overview! The Orange Ball was headed toward the top of the high tension electrical lines for sure! My immediate view was now looking straight up under it as if it were an ultra-lite type aircraft.

It was stepping downwardly by first floating forward and slightly upwardly in a jerking type motion going out about 50 feet or so with four or five jerks then dropping down sharply at a very steep slope rapidly coming to a stop (similar to a mountain climber descending a steep incline) It then repeated this over and over again step by step coming down slow but surely and cautiously! I seemed to be aware of my presence as may have been the reason it was so cautious. I observed this for about 8 to 10 downward steps now having descended about 800 feet and still coming down! I immediately rushed back into the car to dig out an old 35 mm camera in a box in the back seat and tried to get a shot using the camera setting in place as it was dark and I had no light! While doing this I missed the low point of the Orange Ball as it was already stepping upwardly reversing steps and I only got one shot because as I rewound the   sudden down pour of rain was unbelievable.

The clouds closed up and in upon the Orange Ball as I dove back into the car all wetalong with the camera! It should be noted that when first sighted the size appeared to be about half the)size of a car (elev 2000')and about the size of a car at its lowest point(elev 500').

It's apperance was multi colored 1) black nose, 2) then dark red behind the black, 3) then red behind the dark red, 4) then dark orange behind the red, 5) then  bright orange behind the dark orange, 6) then bright white light behind the bright orange.

The Orange Ball made no noise with exeption to the electrical crackling and zapping as it moved very slowly in a floating like motion! I think it was gathering the lose EMFs from atop the high tension electrical power lines like maybe rechargin itself! Last fourth of July two groups both before and after the fire works display observed the Orange Ball! Over the last 40 or so years many have reported white blob type sightings usually under 200 feet.

It acted like a timmed animal when being fed some food off the back porch as it was so-so cautious as it knew it could not come in contact the electrical power lines and unable to see clearly in the low lyng rain clouds, but!probably needed to recharge or die! If only I had my binoculars as at its lowest point (400' elev) I could have really seened the detail.

I then went down Hill Street to the Convient Mart to see if the local Cops were on their coffee break but no one was around! I then proceeded to Frank's in Simpson for a late dinner another place were some type of UFOs come and go up the Lackawanna River Basin toward the headwaters in Arart, PA, their  apparant area of interest when traveling through! The total time of this sighting was about 5 minutes.

I saw three translucent inter-dimensional beings out my window three times in 2 weeks   I was sitting on my recliner in my living room.  I was watching my Television and I noticed something in the trees.  I looked through my big glass window that looks onto the back of the apartment building. I saw three aliens or some kind of beings in my trees.  At least I thought they were in the trees. The tree line is about 10 feet my window.  They were about 4  feet off the ground. I was scared to death, I could not move, I just froze with fear.  There were three of them. They were sitting side by side. At least I think they were sitting, hard to tell because they were translucent. I could see right through them, seeing the leaves move behind them.  Like in the movie ?Predator? they were kind of see through but the outline of them was visible. They were on a platform.  They had very long arms and the width of their bodies were about 6.  Their height was maybe 1 foot, hard to tell since I was not sure if they were sitting or standing.  This was about 10.am around the first week of July, of 2009 in Milwaukee Wisconsin.  I am in an apartment complex that is two stories? high and 10 apartments wide.  Mostly very nice Mexican people live here.  I am from Georgia.  I mention that in case this becomes significant since there are so many sightings of  UFO?s in Mexico.

In no way were these Grays aliens that people talk about.  The face was cone shaped. I could not really make out eyes or any features.  Obviously they were cloaked or thought they were invisible, I do not know.  They stared at me the whole time, never looking around, just right at me for about 4 minutes.  

Finally I got the nerve to stand up slowly and make my way to the front door. I knew the window was open; I wanted to close it because I was afraid they would come in and abduct me. Or do experiments as we hear about what happens to people.  As I had my back to them for only a second, I turned to look back but they had gone. I then went too quickly to my neighbor?s apartment. She asked me if I had seen a ghost. I said just something very weird. I would not tell her for being afraid of her thinking I was crazy. I was so afraid I told no body. Not even my boyfriend who was out of town for the next two weeks. I was there alone.

I want to let you know. I am a 48 year old woman from Georgia. I do not do drugs, I do drink a beer here and there but I had not had any beer for about a week. I have never hallucinated or imagined anything in my whole life. I am not on any prescription drugs and have never been on them. I was really seeing this and wish I had never had. So when Mark came home from working in Canada I did not tell him even though I was still scared. A couple mornings after he was home he woke me to ask if I have ever seen anything weird out the back window.  I said yes, why are you asking me? He was scared, I could tell as he started to tell me that he saw three beings out the back window in the trees that he could see through. It was about 5:30 as we slept in the living room all night since it is cooler then than our bedroom. We have had placed our mattress on the floor near the front door. He said there were three of them side by side with cone faces, long arms and almost he could make out! eyes or holes where there would be eyes. He described them exactly as I had seen them and also they were on a platform. He said the platform was a milky color but still translucent. He could see the outline and see the leaves right through them. He said their heads were moving up and down, to the right to the left looking at the back of out apartment building. He was sure they did not see him since he was so far from the window near the front door on the mattress which is on the floor. When I am in my recliner I am only about 4 feet from the window. He said they were there for about 4 minutes also then they disappeared. When I asked him to point right where he saw them, it was interesting because they were on the right side of our window but when I saw them they were on the left side. Remember now both times were in the morning and same description. He said they were doing something with their hands, maybe working controls? I don?t know, I am just scared out of my mind the! y will come back again. I was happy I could share this bizarre! happeni ng in out lives.

So about two days after Mark had seen them I was in my recliner watching Television. It was around 9 a.m in the morning. I saw movement in the trees again and this time there was only one of the beings. I saw him for about only about 1 minute or minute and a half or so. This time he was in the middle of the window about the same height in the trees.

His cone shaped face and long hanging arms, looking right at me. I was very scared and had a look of fear on my face. Mark was in the room and when he saw my face he saw I was scared but when he turned his head to look it disappeared.

Now I have been analyzing this highly unusual event. I am scared all time. I am in fear they will take mark or myself to where to do what? Why appear behind an old run down apartment building in virtually the same place area in the trees? This has reoccurred three times in the morning hours. From about a minute and a half to about 4 minutes they stay to study mark or I? To take readings of the Earth, say maybe they are measuring the Earths magnetic field, gasses in atmosphere? Are they planning an attack on mankind? Do they want to become our friends? Learn our language? Are they just as curious about us as we are of them? Do they want to reproduce with our species? Do they want to use us as food? So many things run through our heads, WHY WHY HERE? Why not appear at the White House, a museum, a school, a park or in a science laboratory? Why behind an old apartment building at OUR WINDOW? Are the other people in the apartments seeing them also? I am not ready to ask around. I want to move out of here as quickly as I can but for financial reasons I don?t see that happening anytime soon. Maybe they will never appear again and my nerves can calm down.

	My girlfriend Mary is vey excited about this. She wants to see them very badly so she can take photos or video tape them to show the world. She says this is very important for the world to see that beings are showing up here repeatedly. She says they probably are not from another world but from another dimension. That maybe their laboratory in their dimension is situated right there at all times but the veil from our dimensions are opening up. They are not really in the trees at all but in their time and a different dimension. They could be opening and closing them. They are showing up as almost invisible, is that because they are scared that we will shoot them? They know enough that this is a common reaction among humans, Shoot first ask questions later. Do they even know we see them at all? Mary says we can roll up a ball of yarn with a long string on the end. When they appear throw it at them, it might go into their place and we might see just a string hanging in mid air! when they closed the veil. The yarn will not show harmful intent because we could put a note on it saying :Become our friends, Talk to us, we know your there. We could put a little present inside the ball of yarn.

She wants to bring in a high tech video camera, digital camera, regular camera, infrared camera, aura camera and a meter she has that can pick up very low frequencies that turns it into voice.

This happened nearly 20 years ago but is forever fresh in my mind.

June 21st 1992 - Southern End of Conesus Lake near Joy Rd. in western NY - USA It was a beautiful summer day filled with waterskiing and fishing with my college sweetheart.We cooked out on the grill at about 7:30pm EST and dinner was ready at about 8pm. Just as our meal was ready to eat, it very suddenly began to rain very hard, like someone had flipped a switch. It had been hot and sunny just previously.

We quickly grabbed the food off the grill to avoid getting too wet and ate indoors.

About 9pm we sat in my car while parked in the driveway to have an after dinner cigarette, as that I had promised not to smoke in my father?s cottage.

I was seated in the driver?s seat and she was in the passenger seat. The front door of the house was located about 3 feet directly off the passenger door of the car. The front door had 3.5?x2.5? glass pane window with curtains.Very suddenly, the rain just stopped.It was suddenly deafenly quiet compared to the rain pounding very hard on the hood of my car. I had the strange ?sensation? that something had just fallen from the sky nearby. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

About 10 seconds later, when I turned my head to the right to face her and comment on the strange weather I saw the creature in the window of the house. It was inside the house holding the curtain back making eye contact with me.

It was huge. It was crouching yet its head was still only inches from the 9? ceiling of the room. I estimate that it must have been over 15? tall when standing erect.  It?s hand holding the curtain back was as large as the window.  It?s  skin was black and shiny but not wet or slimy. It was very muscular and predatory looking. It had a snout about 6-9? long and had pointed incisor like teeth throughout its entire mouth. It?s eyes were very human looking and seemed to denote a  very focused look of sentience and/or intelligence. My mouth dropped and I froze. It seemed that even with the two doors between us we were already much too close (about 3-5 feet away) for safety sake.  It was clearly some kind of predator of great physical power. I didn?t make a sound. This went on for about 30 seconds. I was making direct eye contact with it. When my college sweetheart  finally turned to see what I was staring at, her immediate reaction was to turn back toward me and start punching m! e in the arm screaming ?just drive away!? over and over again.

This shocked me back to my senses. I started the car and peeled out of the driveway immediately. As I drove away I saw it running down the road in pursuit of us, but it seemed to ?phase? in and out? almost like a bad TV reception. She saw it too. I drove very recklessly to put some distance between us. It worked but even so I continued to ?feel? like we were being watched. We talked about what we saw but didn?t know what it was or what to make of it. We were too scared to return back to the cottage that evening. I dropped her off at her parent?s house and then drove to Geneseo NY. I still ?felt? like I was being watched. I ran into a friend walking down the street and told him the story. He wanted to see it. I reluctantly drove him there. When we got there he too could ?feel? the ?vibration? and was now too scared to go inside the house. I however felt that I hadn?t come for nothing and also wanted to turn off the lights and lock the doors of the cottage. When we went inside! the ?vibration? was much stronger and we both found it difficult to breathe.  I felt like I was being stalked. After about 5 minutes we left. I still ?felt? like I was being watched. For about a week I still ?felt? like I was being watched. Even at times even threatened. I was very scared. I felt like I was being followed. I finally couldn?t take it anymore, instead of being afraid ? I got mad! I wanted to challenge it, wanted to physically fight it. That?s when it stopped and I never saw it again.

 I still remember it like it was yesterday, even though for a long time had not a clue as to what it might have been. I just knew it wasn?t of this world. That?s all I knew.

About a year ago I saw a sketch drawing on the internet and it was exactly what I saw.  It was from a conspiracy site dealing with Annunaki/Nephilim ideas.

CITY: OSLO, NORWAY   Late October 2008  Me and my x girlfriend were sitting in the living room and it was  late.

It was silent in the room and we intended to go to bed.

Suddenly the Television turnes one by itself and it became ""sandstorm"" on the screen.

The room was filled with strange electronic sounds and with others sounds.

The reverb told me that it came from a huge hall, like hundred soccer fields! I could hear it was that big, because some strange sounds came from as it was on the ""floor"" and the sounds where like when spit is released in the mouth!! I have heard those electronic sounds once before, and it was on a radio program that clamed it was the way the stomach sound when it has got food and work with the food.!!  The sounds where extremely loud, but also extremely clear, with an amazing sound quality.. I can tell because I have been working with music and sound studios.

The sounds came from everywhere and not the best surround system in the world could make a surround like that. And the stereo in the living room could NEVER have made such a sound. Beside it had grounding problems so I would have heard the humming.

BUT: Somewhere higher up in this huge room we then heard a voice. (male I guess) It sounded very demanding, and it spoke very slowly. But who can tell how many bits it came from the sinking and rising voice pr. Second?! The voice were very deep, and I can not explain, BUT the voice could never come from a human being!!  If I would guess it was a large entity , more than 7 foot tall !!  I would have kept it for my self, if I had been alone.

I would have sayd that it was something in my brain, and nothing real. But two persons heard the same, and two persons can`t have the same hallucination!!  These ten seconds is for me my second  ""meeting"" with UFOs and ETs.  In my childhood my mother and father and five children saw five UFOs. It became headlines in local news, because other people had seen them as well, and UFO Norway took reports.  When they disappeared the speed was outstanding, and that?s an understatement! This was around the mid 60s.  I now know that they were hanging over a certain mountain, because they were scrutinizing the NATO northern flanks radar facility in North Cape. I have heard that they are very interested in radars.

At about 10:52 PM in Downtown Petersburg, Illinois I and 3 other witnesses all saw the same UFO flying overhead.  It covered about 50 degrees of the sky in no more than 10 seconds.  It was triangular in shape with an orange glowing light on each point of the triangle.  It had absolutely no sound as it passed through the sky.  During the time it was flying overhead my friends and I were able to determine that it was nothing man made.

It passed overhead from a direction of Northwest and flew southeast until we couldn?t see it due to light pollution of fast food signs.  The lights at first made me think that it was a collection of birds, but upon realizing that they were all too uniformly spaced to be anything of the sort.  It was amazing how fast it was flying because right after we looked a plane and it appeared to be going at least 10 times faster than the plane.

The size in comparison to the moon was about 3 moons in the area of a triangle.  The area between the three lights blocked out the stars behind it.  It was like nothing I have ever seen in my life.

I am a Marine veteran and I have decided to tell my story about a sighting that I experienced while working on security forces after the attack on 9/11.  My job in the Marines was TMO 3112. After the attacks on our nation I was detached from my unit and attached to PMO security forces.  I worked the graveyard shift from 1700-0600.  I was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar, San Diego, CA.   The evening of my sighting I was placed on duty, alone, to guard a gate on the flight-line.  I can?t remember the exact gate number, I believe it was 15, but I do know that it was at the north end where the c-130s were parked.  I had been on Security forces for awhile and I had a routine way of keeping myself alert and awake.  It is a severely punishable offence to fall asleep on post. I would take caffeine pills throughout the night and practice drill movements if I felt myself getting tired.

On this particular evening I was very alert.  It was particularly cold that night, and being alone on post made me very aware of my surroundings.  The small shack that was my post was not heated, so I would frequently leave the shack and walk the small perimeter of the flight-line that was my post.   On the last of these walks I left my shack and began walking the flight-line.  Something above caught my eye.  As I reverted my gaze upward, I was astonished to see small, bright, circular, orb hovering about 200 yards above the flight-deck.  The object was no bigger than the circumference of my body. I am a female and I stand at about 65 inches.  In a flash, it shot down and hovered inches above the flight deck. It hovered there for a few moments, and then just as quickly as it came down, it shot back up into the night sky, and was gone.

I was unsure of how to go about reporting it.  I logged the sighting in my log book and radioed it in to my command post.  I was almost immediately relieved of my duty at that post, by a Staff NCO.  I was told that I was tired and needed to go home and get some rest, and to report back for duty the following evening.  Now that I have fully performed my contract with the Marine Corps I feel that it is time to tell people other than close friends and family.

I did not see little green men, or a flying saucer.  I saw what I believe was an unmanned recording device.  I have no reason to lie about what I saw and know that what I saw was real, and I hope that with this report maybe another Marine who was guarding another post on the flight-line that night will come forward.

My friend?s father was giving me a ride and it was around 9:20 pm when my friend?s mother (also in car) noticed an unknown lighted object in the sky towards west.  There were 5 people in the car including me, and we all saw the unknown object in the sky.  It was shaped like a flying saucer with blinking lights around it. It was hovering still for the 20 seconds that we got to see it.  I knew it was not an airplane because near it was an airplane and it was much smaller and the lights were different, the ufo looked bigger and closer.  We lost view of it because we were driving. We reached the house, which was not that far from the place we sighted it.  When we got out of the car to take a look it was not there anymore.  My friend?s mother went in the house and drew a picture of what she saw and it matched what we all saw.  The next day I told my food friend about my sighting and she told me that her friend also saw an unidentified flying object last night.  Her frien! d?s description matched mine and we both saw it at around the same time.  It was very noticeable and I?m pretty sure there must be a good amount of people who saw it.","retail sales",5,1,"disk",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2009,2000,4,12,21,"Evening","West",1,0,0,0,0

I was driving my truck from Brundidge to Montgomery on US-231 after delivering a load of frozen food to the Walmart DC. I observed five lights in the sky in front of me.  They were arranged left to right, two close together, one single, two close together.  The spacing of the three sets was about the distance from your index finger to your little finger when held at arms length in front of you.  The lights moved together slowly from west to east (left to right), as though they were attached to one object.  I could see there was a mass there, but being night time I couldn't see what it was clearly, despite the full moon overhead.  It just seemed to be a darker area in the sky where the lights were.  The lights moved slowly and disappeared behind some trees to my right, just off the roadway.  They appeared to be at a lower altitude because of how quickly they went behind the trees.  Then I lost sight of them.

I am a licensed pilot (Airline Transport Pilot license) and know what an airplane looks like.  With these lights there was no red flashing beacon, no flashing strobes, no colored navigation lights.  I thought maybe it was some high altitude jets going by, but again, no strobe lights.  They stayed perfectly seperated too.  Maybe a plane from the local airport, but it was moving slowly and steadily, and at an altitude that I could only guess was below 5000'.  I thought once maybe it was a relection on my windshield, but when I moved my head around the lights didn't change position.  I couldn't hear any sound, but then again in my Peterbilt there is quite a bit of noise.","Driver/Pilot",1,1,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2009,2000,4,12,20,"Evening","South",1,0,1,0,0

Hello, I have seen objects several times in my life. I will list below the year and what was going on at that time.

1985  My 1st sighting, I was in 6th grade, we just came home from food shopping, it was late, my dads friend stopped by, I went into the backyard to help with the groceries, while talking to my dads friend, I noticed lights above me, when I looked up, I saw a large, round craft that was encircled with lights, it moved so slow, I stood there watching it, as it was barely above my home, I asked my dads friend ?What is that? he stated ?I don?t know?. We watched it moved towards my garage, then past the alley, then disappeared out of sight. It was so strange, I never spoke of it. This sighting was in Upland, CA   1989 I was 16, while driving to pick up my friend who lived in Ontario, CA, I noticed an object moving quickly through the sky, it was cylinder in shape. What caught my eye, is that while flying, the craft seemed to be flipping, or turning, it was so strange, that I found myself watching it, suddenly just disappeared. This was in the evening, it was dark out.

Summer 2000 While driving through Phoenix, AZ, it was late, I was on my way to California from Texas, the sky was changing colors rapidly which caught me and my brother?s eye. It was about dusk, when the first craft appeared out of clouds it came, suddenly there were 2, then next thing we knew, there were 5. We started to talk about the crafts and it was like they heard us. The crafts were round, and almost in formation style, when one craft lifts looked like they were signaling to the others, then the others started to signal back. The next thing we knew we were being followed by the crafts, I know it sounds strange, but they stayed with us till we reached our destination. I was so scared I even stopped at some gas station to call my husband, and mom to tell them I was being followed and didn?t know what to do, of course they didn?t believe me, needless to say, I never pulled over to sleep that night, and drove straight through to California. During the time I was driving ! they would put a light on us, then back away, they would hide behind building then pop out of know where, then they drive along side our car. I had never been so scared, and it really sucked no one believed us.

 March 2009 My daughter actually seen this one, she states she was in her room, when she heard a noise, she walked to the window to see 2 crafts, one was hovering above the other. The other one was in our backyard, hovering, she states it was round with lights all around it. She states after a few minutes, it finally started moving towards the front of the house, she came running downstairs saying ?I just seen a UFO it going to the front? so we all ran out to the front porch, but we did not see anything. This was in the evening after dusk, in Piqua,

Sometime during 1981 I had a dream that has not left my memory.  I now believe it was not a dream but an abduction experience.  This occurred in Huntsville, Alabama at night. I have three memories: I was placed in a seat that looked like plastic similar to fast food restaurants.  It was curved and had a high back that protruded above my head.  I was not belted in the seat but I was stuck there and could not move.  My eyes were open but unable to move so I could only see in front of me.  There was a man sitting across from me in a same type of seat, and he was not moving either.  I could see more seating behind him but with the design I could not see anyone sitting.

The second memory I woke up and was on a table in the middle of a room.   I was laying with my head in the south and my feet in the north.  My eyes could not look around, but I could see part of the ceiling and part of the wall on my right.  It appeared to look rounded and somewhat reminded me of commercial office partitions, grey/silver and flat.  I did not know where I was, then my head rolled to the left and I saw a woman walking up a small ramp to a door that I heard open with a ""swish"" sound, like a hatchback car when you open it.  I could see a little of the hall way and it appeared to curve slightly.

The woman was wearing a red bodysuit and seemed to be physically fit.  I saw her head was different, it was larger in the back like it was deformed and her hair was blonde and extremely thin like a chemo patient that is losing most of their hair.  She was on the west side of the room and to the left of me.

She had to know I was looking at her from behind because after the door opened she quickly turned and looked at me.  I saw her in the front view before she knocked me back out apparently with her mind, she did not say anything.  Her body seemed human but I have never seen a face similar to her.

She had a bigger forehead and bigger eyes than a human, her nose was extremely small, almost no cartilage and reminds me of Michael Jacksons small nose.  Her mouth was small too with very thin lips.

The last memory I was in a different seat facing west looking at black windows.  I saw the seat I had been in and it was emply, I still could not look around but I saw a door to the north behind the seat I was in in the first memory.  I was next to the wall and remember the rectangle rounded windows.

Unfortunately, I was in my car driving at the time and as I result was unable to witness the conclusion of the event. I was traveling east on Bethany Home Rd around 19th Ave.  I was headed to the Christown shopping center area to get drive through Taco Bell (bad for me, I know), when I saw a white object in the eastern sky.

The object was bouncing upward and looked like a plastic bag caught in an updraft, which is what I thought it was at first, but then it just stopped and seemed to hover.  I had to make a turn into the parking lot and I lost track of the object.  I parked and got out to try and reacquire it, but no luck.

I got back into the car and drove to the drive through.  After I got there and ordered, and another car pulled in behind me so I couldn't back out, I saw the object again.  This time it was closer to being overhead, slightly north and east of my position. I have to take my eye off it to pull forward.  Once I stopped, I look for the object once again.  Now I see 2 objects, the new one further west of the original. I pull forward again.  Now when I look at the objects, the new one has changed color to red.

The objects are moving, but so slow I could hardly tell.  The white object seems to be moving closer to the red object.  The white object starts to circle around the red object counter clockwise, all the while closing the distance between them. I have to look away to pay for my food.  I look up very briefly after taking my food and see the white object moving away from the red one.  I sped out of the drive through to a parking space; I get out and look for the objects once again.  They are nowhere to be found at this point.

I would like to know if anyone else saw this and if anyone knows what these objects were.","Accounting",1,2,"unknown",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2010,2010,1,3,13,"Afternoon","West",1,0,0,0,0

I was a sleeping elementary school age child, in my own room and in my own bed in Tampa, FL when suddenly, there was light in my room,except the room had no overhead light and I hadn't turned on the light next to my bed. This bedside lamp was the only normal source of light in this room. It was off but there was still much light. This had never happened before.

I had a fast impression of someone being next to my bed. I saw, momentarily, what I perceived to be blue jeans on a man's lower body then, with the light still on, but no one next to me,there was suddenly a lot of noise and commotion.

In the next instant, ""The Sound of Music"" record played very loudly, presumably from the little portable record player in our living room. My room shared a common wall with the living room. When it went on, I sat bolt upright in bed. My first thought was that someone was there to murder us but I dismissed that idea with the thought that murderers probably didn't make all of this commotion-a killer would be quiet.

The music was turned up so loudly that I couldn't believe that my siblings would do something this unusual and dangerous, knowing how violent our parents were. Whichever child was doing this was risking a horrible beating FOR SURE.

I touched my bedroom wall with my hand to prove to myself that I was awake. The wall was solid and normal and I could see and feel the paint. I believed I was awake and I laid back down, in terror. Someone was present and making a tremendous amount of ruckus. I was shaking.

Then there was a staticy feeling in the air. The room was now dark, the music stopped.

I went into shock when I then saw 4 grotestue, blue, wrinkled troll-looking beings in what looked to me to be blue overalls. They were lined up in front of my closet. I thought they looked like drums because they were as stout as they were tall. They weren't tall like a human, they were maybe 3 1/2 - 4 feet tall9maybe smaller) and so wide they were like squares.I must presume that the light must have been back on for me to see them so clearly, to be able to make out color but I didn't think about the light. I was rapidly processing that these were real aliens and this event was really happening, then I was paralyzed.

I felt like every molecule in my body was being pulled through the soles of my feet. I fought with all of my will but could not stop the paralysis or the pulling, which was happening very fast. I was totally and completely terrified.

The next thing I can remember is being on a grate-type bridge walkway that went into a building or something large. I had the thought that ""this is definately happening to me and no one, not even my mother, will ever be able to help me. I wondered if they were going to keep me.

Then, things get confusing in my own ability to be sure of the order of any of the following things that happened.

In the place with all the grating, someone was somehow, maybe telepathically telling me that there was a problem somewhere. I was shown a darkened room with giant preying mantises just walking around. I think there was a window or something between me and them because they didn't seem to notice or care about me in any way.

Then I was shown a cloaked being in the same room I was in, who I automatically presumed was an old what-ever-she-was because she was very wrinkled and seemed very weak. I was shown this from a perspective of first being behind ""her"", to her right. I saw the dark cloak then the being who was at my side walked me up to look at her face. He told me more about the problem these beings had but its vaque to me. My impression was that whatever the problem was it had led to her appearance and weakness.

I remember being in a smaller craft, seeing the stars go by very fast through a window, feeling very alone, and once again realizing that this was real. I definately thought then that I was the only human in this craft. They didn't treat me like a child. There was no comfort offerred, no food, no water, no blanket and no one to help me. It was all matter-fact, like in this transport the beings were just performing a normal routine thing.

Again, I'm not sure of the order of events as I only have snippets of scenes in my memory.

I remeber walking, with no resistence and not much fear, concern or even interest now. I just went along willingly. I don't know who was with me at this point but my best recollection is of someone short.

We passed two human-looking beings to our left. There was a little girl with dark brown or black hair just kind of standing to the left of a large glass cylinder. A human man with dark hair was in the large cylinder. It looked like a large test tube. They didn't take any significant notice of me and oddly I now realize, I didn't make any effort to communicate with them. We never made eye contact. I never even tried to.

As we kept walking, he(?), the being, now on my right, continued telling me I don't remember what-until he had me look down at small horizontal portals or screens that showed different military things including an arial view of a large rocket with smoke and ""things"" flying around it. My impression was ""war"" I felt sadness and I definately said or thought loudly ""If you know all this, show me how I'm going to die"" and he did. He showed me a larger vertical screen and I watched myself, as an adult woman with long dark hair walking alone into a high floor of a ski chalet. There was a large picture window and I looked out upon a beautiful scene below of trees and lots of snow.

Now, at this point, I feel more like I'm living it rather than watching it. I walked toward the main living room type area. Maybe 8, 10 people were in the living room, most sitting on sofas and some just milling about. I remember thinking that there should be no problem here because I knew most or all of the people. I started to walk to a sofa to sit down and a man just came up behind me and slit my throat. It felt like a true event happening in real time. I felt like I was blacking out, dying, and my last thought in this scenario was ""I can't believe this could happen. I know all of these people. Why isn't someone helping me? Was this a plot they were all in together?"".

Then I was back, standing in front of this vertical scene, with the being who had no emotion about my death scene. None. I asked so he showed me. It was just a matter of future history, nothing personal on his part in any way.

From there, things are very ""fuzzy"".

I felt like I was lying down, in a different place, kind of flooating, then on(?) a white table, with doctors around me and the table, mostly to the left side of me. I felt euphoric-a feeling I would now liken to a narcotic only more exaggerated.

One of the doctors said my name!  I felt something like a metal rocket-shaped 'thing' being inserted. I was somehow okay with this!  The next memory is of me in a small spaceship, traveling in my parent's yard to my bedroom window.

The being piloting, to my left, was very blond and looked almost like a human male adult but my sense was that he was not human. His skin was too white-opague and his demeanor was like ""nothing"". There only seemed to be room for the two of us in this craft but I could see all around us. I think he telepathically mentioned ants and aloe vera as we flew over some. I'm not sure if I really remember the aloe vera-ant thing or if I conflabbed it.

We were very low to the ground. We neared my window and I thought ""Oh, we're going in my window"" but we did not.

Still in the small craft, I remeber vividly that I felt very raw (emotionally, not physically), invaded, disappointed, very saddened. Something had been taken from me, from my body. I felt a sad emptiness and the being imparted to me ""Its done. There's nothing you can do about it"" My regret seemed to surprise or confuse this being. Maybe even irritation would describe his affect. This was the only millisecond of ""feeling"" that I received from him. ""Disturbance of the norm""  I heard two whistling, spinning noises, I felt cold, I felt a little spinning then I SAW my own bedcovers UNDER me as I flew into place in my own bed.

I don't recall waking up that morning but I obviously did and just went about the morning like it was a normal day.

I remembered later in the same day that this had happened. I was walking from my elementary school lunchroom, in line with my classmates, headed back to class when I remembered. I knew the word schizophrenic and knew if I told my mother she would take me to a psychiatrist and that would be what they would say.

I knew it had really happened but believed I was the only person in all of history that this had happened to or would happen to.

I made my mind up on that sidewalk that day that for my own protection, I could never tell a living soul.

I have no idea if this was one event or numerous events that my mind has spliced together. I only remember the paralysis and sucking through the feet feeling happening one other time. I was even more terified the second time and totally determined not to go again. With all my will and strenghth, I moved my right little finger and the paralysis was broken.

I've never had the feeling again, never been taken anywhere and have had no conscious awareness of any aliens anywhere since then.

The most important thing I can tell you is that when I returned home from school that day and went to use our restroom, I had a straight red line from my naval to my pubis. It was shocking to me but also forced me to admit the reality of this whole thing to myself. The red line looked like a perfect surgical incision had been made and closed but there were no suture marks, no staples, no apparent source of closure. The red line was perfectly straight and is visible to this day. It has become a thin brown line visible from about 3 inches from my naval down to the top of the pubis. I definately welcome inspection of this ""scar"" by medical researchers. No doctor or boyfriend has ever noticed or commented on it.

Later, maybe 5 or 10 years later when I first read of animal mutalations, I had chills and anxiety. I felt certain this was the work of the beings who took me.

I was a straight A student but a compartmentalized nervous wreck from then until recently. I could not become truly emotionally connected to anyone and I lived in complete terror that something like this would happen to my own daughters.

When they came to take me the second time, I felt I was marked in some way or how would they know to take ME again?  Since in the death scenario I had long dark hair and was an adult - once I became an adult I dyed my hair blond, kept it short and knew I would never live in or go to places with ski chalets and snow.

Now 54, I find myself in Colorado because I need to live near my oldest daughter who lives here. She is my primary care giver and I truly need her help - so I'm here. I have a devastating terminal disease.

Prior to this disease I now have, I lived only in hot places -FL and NV I was so determined to not live out the death scene.

I have neuromyelitis optica and I am now blind. My immune system is shredding my nervous system one cranial nerve at a time. This began in the 80's.It is a very rare disease and one of the few conditions that causes both blindness and paralysis in the patient, then leads to death by the failure of the intercoastal muscles.

 I hated the beings my whole life. I hated that they took an innocent, already traumatized child without even asking the child. It was a violent kidnapping in my opinion.

Now that I am aware of so many stories similar to mine, I'm calmer in one respect(I'm not the ONLY one) but now, I'm very concerned for all humankind. What is going on?!  I have been diagnosed with PTSD from chilhood abuse and adult onset PTSD from going blind. A more correct diagnosis would have been lifelong PAS, I have no doubt.

To clarify one of answers regarding number of craft seen-I said 3. I may have seen one from the outside, in my yard, during the same event but everything else was inside a craft. I count them as 1-the grating & preying mantises, the little girl, the death scene and the medical stuff 2-the craft in which I was flown rapidly by a military type ""crew"" and 3- the tiny ship from which the blond took me across the yard and into my room.

I had a horrible childhood in every possible way because of the on-going anxiety and terror from this event, the constant beatings from my adoptive parents and a year of molestation by my 5th grade teacher.

I became a life-long loner.

In the 90s, I told one friend and both of my daughters of the event. All three said they believed me, which makes it possible for me to tell you now.

I also told a boyfriend who was a paramedic and is now a nurse in a infant and children's trauma ward in LV. He did not believe my story was real but does believe that I believe it. He believes that this is a cover story created by my mind because I cannot accept that I was raped as a child. He doesn't believe in UFOs and thinks we are alone in this vast universe.

I was NOT raped as a child. Beaten by parents, molested by a teacher but there was no rape event.

I can't really care if anyone believes me or not. It doesn't change any of what happened.

I feel like my whole life was stolen from me. I've not had one day since the event that I felt normal or that I fit in anywhere. There is some relief in knowing that people, lots of people worldwide, now know of these kinds of abductions and that there is at least investigation being done now.

I used to pray that one day there would be a registry or someway to tell legitimate researchers and scientists what happened to me in the hope of one day really understanding why they picked me.

Because I believe it neccessary for my good mental health to forgive them, I do, to a point, but I still hate the little, blue drum-like ones who took me with absolutely no regard for me, my terror, my youth.

I like to think that if they ever came along now that I wouln't be frightened of them. I think I would be bold and demand some answers this time.

I worry about, but also look forward to some kind of event where all the abductees are made known to the world so people will know that this really happened to lots of us and perhaps, is still happening to some people, especially children.

I believe I saw 6 different kinds of aliens : 1-the horrible little blue drum-like ones who took me, 2-the preying mantises,3- the ""crew"" of the shuttle 4-the ""explainer"" who walked me past the two humans and showed me the ""war"" pictures and my own alleged death. 5- the doctors and 6-the very white man who took me home through my ceiling.

Very oddly, I have no direct recall of any of the ""greys"" with the big eyes, claimed by so many abductees but I also can't tell you what the""crew"" or the ""explainer"" or the doctors looked like at all. I don't know why I can't remember something this important, but in 40+ years I've never remembered their faces.

I was adopted at birth from McDill AFB and have speculated that the doctor who knew my name might have been a human military doctor.

In 1979 I had to have an emergency surgical procedure (a right oophorectomy) because my right ovary had become gangrenous from ""torsion of the tube"". No eggs were visible in this ovary upon removal nor upon follow-up microscopic examination. No doctor was able to explain this or determine where my eggs were,  or if there had ever been any in that ovary.

I had a normal pregnancy in 1980 and gave birth to my second daughter. She has extra vertebrae in her neck and was born with eyes so almond-shaped I worried for a time that she might be mongoloid. She is not.

In 1983, following the 1979 removal of my right ovary and a 1982 surgical procedure to eliminate some of the remaining left fallopian tube to insure contraception, and with my partner having had a vasectomy, I was told that I was pregnant again. I lost the baby and all the attending physician would tell me is that the baby was not normal. I was not shown the baby.

In 2008, following 7 years of total menopause and having no partner for 8 months, as my boyfriend had died, I was again told I was pregnant. I was 52 years old. I was hospitalized for 3 days and all 12 blood pregnancy tests came back positive, as well as all urine tests. The hospital lab was in a bit of an uproar about ""the old, blind pregnant lady with no partner"". I was released into the care of my family practioner who administered a blood pregnancy test in her office two weeks later. It came back negative.

(The emergency room doctor seemed extremely interested in the fact that I had torsion of the tube in my 20s but he never elaborated. He just seemed very excited and interested in this fact. So much so that I wondered then and I wonder now, WHY was this of so much interest to him? As his name is on the medical record as the admitting doctor, I hope one day someone will ask him why this was a big deal to him. No other medical professional has ever raised an eyebrow when I mention it, yet he was incredulous and focused on it at length. He then performed an ultrasound and determined that my womb was empty. He admitted me, baffled).

Because I had chemotherapy in 2007-09 for this neuromyelitis optica, my doctor believes I was experiencing endocrine changes. I think this is likely correct as I have had no other encounters since the 60s of which I am aware.

Truthfully, I think the neuromyelitis is a result of both the chil abuse and the abduction. I think it was all too much for my nervous system. I see a very qualified neuro-opthomologist who has no idea at all why I have this disease.

I've never had the courage to tell any medical professional treating me or any mental health professional of the abduction because I believe they will label me ""insane"".

I'm not.

I have been troubled and anxious for 40+ years. I have attempted suicide too many times to count (okay, 5). The most recent event, in 2008, was a compulsive act that I felt was not entirely of my own accord.

Suddenly, one afternoon, I wanted very much to put a screwdriver through my left wrist, which makes absolutely no sense to me. I did not do that but with almost an uncontrollable intensity, I took an over-dose of Wellbutrin and Prozac. Somehow, I took just the right combination for the drugs to balance each other out and though I spent the night in intensive care, I had almost no effect from the 15 pills or more that I ingested. No nausea, no vomiting, no convulsions, not even a hiccough. I can't believe how out of control of myself I felt while taking the over-dose. It was a manic event that still doesn't make sense to me. Never have I heard of ""death by screwdriver"" and I'm no handyman. Usually, I don't even own a screwdriver and have never at any other time thought about a screwdriver in any odd way like this.

I am a mother. If I were really going to intentionally kill myself there is no doubt that I would leave lengthy letters of explanation for my adult daughters. I would make logical plans, I would give away treasured momentos, I would say good-bye to those I love, yet, I didn't do any of this. I just felt  this over-whelming impulse to put a screwdriver through my own wrist. Instead, I took lots of pills very quickly. I remember counting 12, 13, 14...like they were M&Ms, instead of strong medications.

I was a medical professional myself (an EMT and medical writer) and NEVER would I do this.

And yet, I did.

The other 4 attempts prior were clustered from 2001 to 2004 and were also compulsive acts. No planning, just action that seemed to be out of me instead of from me. I tried to jump off a mountain (my daughter decked me to keep me from doing this), I ran out into traffic (everyone stopped), I went to a desolate location in an attempt to die from exposure and starvation (this was clearly going to take a long time and be painful) and I asked someone I didn't know to get heroin for me so I could over-dose. I took twice the amount they said would be dangerous and waited. All I got was a headache.

Obviously, I'm not very good at suicide.

I don't think I will ever try again because now, if I felt the compulsion, I would resist totally.

Enough of my life has been taken from me by others.

Once I made the connection that the US military was probably involved in this, which was only recently, I began to feel much stronger but also even more angry. What do I think? I think I was taken by aliens but that the doctor who knew my name was human and that both were somehow benefitting from whatever they did to me. I truly think I was selected because I was an adoptee from an AFB and was already traumatized.

Obviously, all of the medical information I am recounting is verifiable through medical and hospital records, which I'm happy to provide to any legitimate researcher. I welcome the opportunity to have truth serum administered and would agree to be hypnotized by a medical professional. In both scenarios I would ask that a video recording be made of the entire questioning procedure and I would want a trained UFO researcher present in both cases.

Its taken my whole life to put these snippets together. I remembered some of it that day but was an adult before I realized why I always had to have a rectangular white dining table. I could almost remember but not quite, then one day in Sarasota, FL, following the purchase of my 3rd or 4th white rectangular table, I remembered. I was on one. I think it possibly emitted white light. How else would I know it was white if I was lying on it? I don't remember anyone removing my clothing, nor do I know how my clothing was returned to my body.

Unlike the other stories I've been reading on the Internet, I was not shown any babies or told anything about hybrids. I wasn't asked to touch or hold anything or anyone.

I now think they took eggs from my right ovary and I think they left the fallopian tube and ovary malpositioned which resulted in the torsion. It might have been intentional because the gangrene certainly made it impossible for doctors to tell what had happened to my right ovary and eggs.

I believe they take children because we are closer to their size.

Even now as I write this, I feel sick to my stomach and sweaty.

I would give most anything to know the whole truth of what happened to me - and apparently others- and WHY.

Finally, let me say that I am a professional writer and have been virtually my whole adult life. If I were going to make up a story, I promise you, it would make a lot more sense than this. I WISH I was making it up.

Though it happened to me, it remains almost too incredible for me to believe but the scar is still there.

Before she passed in 2003, my mother and I spoke of the scar. All she really said was ""yeah, you have had that for a long time."" I don't know why she said this because NEVER did I show it to her or tell her about it in any way. She never commented if and when she really ever saw it, yet she acted like ""yeah, aliens, no big deal."" No surprise, no questions.

I thank you with my whole heart for providing this forum to people like myself who have kept this horrible secret inside ourselves for our whole lives. I hope someone will contact me and help me sort it out.

Due to the blindness, phone contact is the best way to reach me. I would accept a collect call but I only have a cell phone and they don't permit collect calls. I can't read my own e-mail and must have others read it for me. I would prefer not to have to talk about it with anyone except a valid researcher.

Thank you very much - and if you are connected to the military in any way DO NOT contact me. And I better not have any MIBs hanging around once I submit this to you. I am so NOT even kidding. If I am contacted by ANYONE except a UFO researcher, I WILL DENY that I wrote this and swear that it never happened.

If you are truly valid UFO researchers, I hope you will know by content that this DID happen. Please give me a chance to provide the little proof that I have (the scar).

My uncle, father and I were in the keys at my Uncles trailer for a fishing trip Saturday March 20th 2010.  After a great day of fishing we headed to the house to unload clean up and cook some fish.

At around 9:00pm my father was frying some fish outside and my uncle and I were preparing some food in the house.  My father opens the outside door and calls us out to go outside quick! We run outside and he points to the sky.

We were facing North and we saw at first 4 amber (lighter flame orange) orbs moving in towards land coming from the east (ocean side).  They were about airplane altitude but I would say just a bit lower in altitude.

They were moving very slowly but at a semi constant speed but almost evenly spaced apart traveling in a straight line playing follow the leader sort of speak.  There was absolutely no sound!  No red or green lights which is mandatory for aircrafts, and the sky was clear of any cloud cover.  We could see all the stars out that night.

As the first orb got to about mid sky, it gave off a soft pulse effect and zoomed out of our atmosphere at an incredible speed, almost instantaneously turning into a distant white star, then after a second it was absolutely GONE!  It did not break the horizon like any regular aircraft, this thing broke out of our atmosphere! The following 2 followed suit, doing exactly what the first one did in the exact point in the sky traveling in the same direction.  By the time the forth one was reaching the spot in the sky where the others had gone, 3 more same looking orbs popped out from the same direction from where the other 4 originated from.

This time the first one after about 10 seconds of moving slowly following the same path as the others, decided to zoom out to the point of looking like a white star and came back as the orange orb really fast!  After, the 6th orb decided to do a little dancing zig zag side to side a couple of times then got back in line.  They all followed the same direction and broke out through the atmosphere 1 by 1.  Truly was an amazing experience.  Ive tried to think of all the things it could have been and I only have one answer??UFO?s.  Our neighbor was present during the event with us.

My Uncle got his camera but its not an amazing camera and could not get a good picture of the spectacle. But the event will forever be imprinted in my head.

I went out to put food out on the side of the house for a stray dog we were attempting to rescue.  The neighbors were not keen on the dog as he was a pitbull therefore I put the food out in the wee a.m. hours.  As I was coming back in the house/front door, a light caught my eye to the NW horizon over the cul de sac.  I stopped with my jaw dropped and just stood there to take it in.  I said to myself I am witnessing a close up view of a UFO so I better take this in as I knews it was most likely a once in a life time exp.  It was VERY close, very large and actually just sitting, as parked in the sky. It was actaully quite beautiful, one large craft-appeared to be 3 stories and I know this will sound weird, but it was like somoene had taken the top tier of an office building and parked it in the sky..it had windows...much like you see when you look up at a highrise office building.  It was all lite up with bright white lights-penetrating...as I said quite beauti! ful to take in.  It just sat there and did not move, the back drop was nothing but the black sky...it looked so close that I was tempted to walk towards it to the culdesac to get closer, that is when as I was standing at my front door got a bit spooked and thought I should go in.  I wanted to wake a neighbor to witness but it was the middle of the night thru the week, school-work, and I thought to go upstairs and get my camera, but the batteries are always weak and thought it will be gone when I return...so I went inside, looked out the window and it was still sitting there...then I went back to bed....stupid!!! So wish I had stayed to see it move, but as I mentioned I had taken it in , in great detail, no one to share it with and didn't want to stay outside any longer by myself.  I didn't tell any neighbors lest they think I was crazy, and really my prioirty at the time was attempting to rescue the dog (which was a succuss a few days later).  I did share the sighting with ! my immediate family and my best friend and then just filed it ! away as I have never known who to report it to that was reputable and where I could remain annonymus...so it is almost exactly a year later and on my mind I googled and found your site.  I hope this is a reputable site.  I can tell you I have watched, googled many sighting shows etc. since my siting and I have yet to run across anything that was as large and close with such a clear view of what I witnessed.  I would love to be able to share more details of my sighting to the appropriate personnel.  It was quite amazing, astonishing and etched in my momeory.  Oh, one other note...a couple of days later I drove behind our neighborhood to where I thought approx. it was sitting in the sky, 1/4 of a mile no more and it was over desolate wetlands...nothing around where it would have been in the sky....thought that was interesting.  Thank you.

Last night sometime between 23:00 and 0:00 on 6/11/10 I went upstairs and just happened to see two yellow lights that appeared to be stationary on Duncan road near our horse pasture.  I thought someone was messing with the horses so I ran downstairs and grabbed a powerful flashlight and went outside and pointed the light down Duncan road.  Nothing was there, there was no sound, absolutely nothing was visible or could be heard. I scanned the flashlight beam all around and the horses were resting and did not appear disturbed.  I forgot about it.  Shortly after that I heard a crash on the porch and a chair with cat food on it was turned over with no sign of an animal.  This could have been a raccoon or something.  My wife works late and got home about 00:30 after midnight and I told her about the chair, but did not mention the lights.

Today on 6/12 my wife and I were coming home from eating lunch and she mentioned she saw four lights red and yellow on Mile Creek road where Love Care road intersects.  This is no more than a mile from our house. She said the lights moved rapidly off to one side and were gone.

My Boyfriend, and I, were outside grilling some food on the 4th of July 2010.  It was approximately 9:25 pm or so when I sat down at the table and I was watching the neighbors down the block blowing off some fireworks in the distance.  I got up and walked to the back of the yard so I could see if I could see any other fireworks going off.  As I looked over the front of my house, I seen this object coming toward me. It was orange in appearance, and was almost like glowing, like an aura around it or something. It made no noise what so ever.  It was almost silent, but looked almost like it was spinning the body part of it, but was just moving forward.  It was the strangest thing!  I started freaking out, and yelled for my boyfriend.   As he came over it was now almost right over the front of our house. It wasn?t very high in the sky maybe a couple hundred feet above our trees.  He ran into the house, and tried to grab the camera, but by the time he came back it was alre! ady over our neighbors house, and hidden by their trees.

I kept watching in the sky, turning in circles hoping I would see it again.  Maybe 2  minutes later another one appeared in the same direction the first one appeared to of come from.  This one was way up high still in the sky coming down from the clouds.  It seemed to stay up in the clouds as it moved along heading toward my direction kind of diagonal though along my fence line.  An airplane was coming in the sky toward it I believe it was maybe like 9:28-9:30 pm or so by now not sure. As the airplane headed toward this unidentified object it went back up in the sky, and the lights seem to disappear, or go off.  The aircraft then was over the spot where this craft was, and went passed it. I thought it was gone but then it came down out of the clouds but behind my house in the sky.  This time the craft came down and had it?s lights out and seemed to be a bit bigger than the other one that went over my house.  I could clearly see this space craft because of the street lights behind m! y house in the court. It was clearly a flying saucer, disk shaped.  It was grey, silverfish looking,  and was flying quietly. It was moving very slowly like hovering, or scoping things out.  Then it began to speed up and looked like it was coming down.  It was flying like it was looking for a place to land, or  something . It disappeared on the other side of the block past the trees where I couldn?t see.

I didn?t report this to Local police department. I know how people get treated, when they report these things to police departments, and say they see UFO?s. I know what I saw, and it wasn?t no airplane, fireworks, none of that. I got a good clear view of these objects, and I am positive about what I seen.

There has to be others here in town that seen this. I don?t know if anyone else might of reported this here in town. They didn?t say anything about it in the local papers, but that isn?t surprising where we live.

It was july 4th evening appox 10pm.  I had been invited to my friends new home for a few drinks and some food.  There were seven people there in total.  We were sitting on the back porch enjoying the nice night.  At approx. 11:30pm I noticed two redish orange lights off in the distance to the north of our location headed in a south east direction. Im not positive on their elevation but they were as low as a small prop plane would fly.  The two lights were flying side by side at first. One of the objects seemed to speed up ahead of the other. It slowed down just in front of the other then continued in this formation till they were out of my line of sight.  I told the others to ""look at those lights!""  My friend scott looked but blew it off as nothing.  Then as has happened to me before everyone commented on how i was seeing things.  But i know scott saw the same thing i did.  Again, at approx.  11:45 pm a second redish orange light at the same elevation and heading in the same direction as the previous two objects came into sight.  This one was moving slowly at first but seemed to gain speed as it traveled.  This one was by itself.  It traveled in a south east direction and like the other two disappeared out of my sight behind a tree line. I did not mention this object to my friends due to the fact that they refuse to believe even the things they see i guess.

We walked I would guess 3 miles then us 4 including myself saw two ""balls of fire"" in the air about 30 yards off the road we were walking on. They did not appear to be large, maybe the size of a basketball. They moved quickly in all kinds of directions. Not sure how to explain it.

I work night shift at the Clarian Arnett Hospital as a nursing assistant. I was on my way back from getting food on my break around 2:10 am, and saw a floating object directly over the intersection in front of the hospital. It was just over the traffic lights. I stopped (at a green light) to see what it was but cannot wrap my head around what I saw.

It was grayish blue, there were no streetlights just car headlights, it is very dark around the hospital, and I estimate it as being the size of a large dog. To me it looked like some sort of creature, floating silently and slowly straight up. No drifting or blowing in the wind. It had what looked like a very large head with the rest of the body which did appear to have 4 appendiges about the same size as the head, and it appeared to be almost upside down. it didnt move, just floated up as if being lifted from the sky. I turned around and went back, and it was gone.

I parked in the back of the hospital parking lot and a man with a little boy were walking out to the road pointing and looking where the object had been. I walked up to him and asked if they saw it too and if they knew what it was. He said that he did, he was able to see it from up close to the hospital. But he didn?t know what it was either. It was gone. I don?t know hoe it could have disappeared so fast or whether anyone else in the cars saw it.

Looking out the windows that night I noticed the moon was large, and there was a very large very bright light that stayed in the same proximity to the moon the entire night. And could see many tiny and very far away green lights appearing and disappearing and streaking the sky above. 2 of the RN?s I work with also witnessed this. The next 2 nights I?ve seen nothing and the moon is gone. I am baffled and terrified.","Nursing Assistant (CNA)",3,1,"other",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2010,2010,3,8,2,"Night","Midwest",1,0,0,1,0

I am a chef that was working at the Food and Wine festival in Beverly Hills today.  At around 5 pm I happened to look up at the sky when I noticed two lights flying horizontal from one another.  They were very bright and obviously not helicopters as they were flying at too high an altitude and not planes as it was still daylight and I could not see the normal outline of a plane.  Behind the first set of lights I observed an identical set of lights flying the same pattern.  The objects also appeared to have a slight wobble to their flight path which was unlike anything I have ever seen in the sky.  Also my co-worker standing next to me he noticed it appeared the lights had sort of a energy field surrounding them.  When the lights reached the middle of the sky at least 6-8 new lights began to appear and the lights began to form different formations in the sky.  The changing of formations lasted between 10-15 min and then the lights vanished.

NOT REPORTED AS A SIGHTING.

This is submitted as an FYI:  Happened to notice the curious link or ""coincidence' between the UUO/UFO sightings off the North Carolina coast in the general vicinity of an undersea anomaly [or anomalies] linked here:
 http://www.googleearthanomalies.com/Anomalies/tabid/56/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/31/Topographic-Anomalies-NC-Area.aspx  

There should be an ISOLATED reporting category dedicated to OFF SHORE sightings and the possible link with Military activity there [which is usually extensive].  Having retired from the US Navy I can attest that there always has been a lot of Air Ops/Submarine Ops/NATO Exercise situations there.  Also - STILL classified are many log entries depicting ""unknown anomalies"" both entering and exiting the waters all along the Outer Banks area.

IF there IS a special military involvement in that area [above] it would indicate more than a casual interest in surrounding ""anomalies"" --- OR ... these are archeological structures that fall under strict MILITARY EYES ONLY ... with US and other foreign Nuclear Subs 'mapping' the terrain.

Personally I believe all of these are related ... that aside from the Puerto Rican Trench -- there are enough indications of undersea BASES .. perhaps of EITHER E.T. or Military [perhaps joint].

The same situation also appears off the West Coast in the vicinity of Catalina Island .. where there also lay a trench of UNUSUAL formation.  Sightings have been around this area as well [numerous].

UUOs are just as numerous .... but SERIOUS attention needs to be made to see if these UUOs are, indeed, linked to undersea anomalies.  And that bases like the US Navy's AUTEC (Atlantic Underwater Testing and Evaluation Center), perhaps have a TWO-FOLD role.

On January 28th 1986 I viewed the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on TV on a rare day off from commissioning a local power plant. After about an hour of watching it over and over again on TV, I was called-in to work.  I left around 1pm from Whiteville, NC to travel to Elizabethtown, NC.  I travelled Red Hill Road, a less used route, as I wanted to avoid lunch traffic in town.   Just a couple of miles from Clarkton, NC I started to pass through a wooded swamp area that had been heavily logged.

From my right I caught a glimpse of something large through the open areas and remaining trees heading from my right to left (North to South). I slowed down as I was expecting to see some large Military aircraft travelling way to low or thought it could be a passenger jet about to crash.

When it appeared in front of me over the open road I was shocked to see a craft that was metallic brown, cigar shaped, with either windows or squares and a ziz-zag pattern around them. The craft had no wings and there was no sound and was travelling too slowly for any aircraft I knew of to stay airborne.   I know this because this was not a distant sighting. The craft was right in front of me maybe 500 to 1000 yards away and I got the best and only view I have ever had of an unknown craft as it passed in front of me heading south.

I had spent six years in the Navy and had been discharged only about 6 months prior. I had seen the Russian bear, migs, most of our jets and aircraft in Grenada, Lebanon, and all over the world.

Later my wife and a friend brought food to the power plant for me.  When they arrived they were all excited about seeing dancing lights in the sky, the kind that dance around then join into one before travelling off at an astonishing speed. They witnessed this in the same area in the swamp on Red Hill Road just after sunset that day.

It?s been 24 years since that sighting, and I don?t feel as uneasy talking about it now.","Power Plant Operator/Mechanic",1,1,"cigar",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1986,1980,1,1,13,"Afternoon","South",1,0,0,0,0

On 9/14/10 at approximately 845 pm I went to the back yard of my residence to feed my dog.  As I walked to get his bowl to give him food I observed a bright red light in the south west sky in the Williamston area close to I-85, that looked to be several thousand feet up,  and thought it looked odd to be so bright.  The ball of light  was the size of a golfball and later marble in relation to a star.  As I continued to look at the light it then dropped within a second to just above the tree level and hovered,  I then ran back to my back door and yelled for my wife to come look so that I would know that I was seeing the same thing.  She then looked and only saw the object hovering and commented on how bright it was.  As myself and her were watching it the light then emitted another light below it which was bright orange in color.  The lighted object then began to dance from left to right up and down! My wife became frightened after she realized the same thing I! apparently did and knew that the way it was moving could not have been a helicopter or airplane due to the speed and movements it was doing.  The object then dropped lower below the tree line into a heavily wooded area and I could then see what looked like several bright headlights shining through the trees.  As that happened I could then tell it appeared to be within a mile of my house.  I then called my neighbor and another and asked for them to come outside and see what we were seeing.  As all seven of us were watching it, the object then lifted back up very rapidly several hundred feet and disappeared.  It then reappeared across the sky for a few moments and ?danced? as it did earlier for five to six minutes.  It then disappeared for the second time.  We watched for almost two hours to see if it came back, but it did not.  It was officially the weirdest thing I had ever seen!  I did contact our local news agency and asked if they received any calls asking about the obj! ect we all saw and they stated they did receive more than a fe! w.

I was exiting a food store at Warm Springs and Sunset Rd. on the south-west corner.  I looked up because something in the periphery of my vision appeared.  I saw an intense green fireball traveling west to east at a very high rate of speed.  I could not guess the altitude; it was about the size of my small fingernail.  It appeared like it came over some houses to the west and then into the vicinity of the parking lot, where it blinked out, just before it disappeared a bright orange spark came shooting off of it.  There appeared to be a hazy orange aura surrounding the fireball, which was in the shape of a square more than a ball. There was a small trail of the green material following it that disappeared when the object blinked out.

There was no sound, no smoke given off, no evidence after it disappeared.  There were no aircraft in the area at all.

The exact date might be a bit different i forget what years i worked for the company i could find out when exactly what year it was but i was working as a bat specialist and traveling out to a job on the highway late at night, in mid-summer, in a truch with a hatchback with the guy i worked for ben when to the left of the vehicle while we were listening to some books on tape i saw a yellow orb, it was moving forward in a bowling motion like pendulem back and forth. I thought i was halucinating then checked my eyes and looked again and it was still there penduluming back and forth moving forward west like we were but slower, i said to ben ""look a ufo a ufo a yellow ball like thing in the sky look"" but he refused and was the one driving and i persisted ""look look their is a yellow orb in the sky moving back and forth moving forward"" but he refused to look he didn't really think much of my opinions. I never really thought to report it for what can they do and w! e out drove it  and it wasn't able to be seen, i forsure saw for quite a few minutes this yellow orb and have fathomed my own opinion on it. I was just watching a show on ufo's and thought a real report as to how this one was moving or whatever could help since they were going through reports. I can or could take a lie detector on seeing this thing mutiple ones actually and this was the only time while traveling or ever that i saw one, and i really saw it, under just the classification a yellow orb, it was to me looking like a orb like i fathomed a being being in it but it radiated light like it wasn't a craft. It was an orb of like energy, i fathomed that a being could be in it some how super powered and uses like an energy orb to protect it in space, or possibly a supernaturally powered being that is supernaturally activated. Like seriously the powers like flying beings experince in dreams your telling me none ever became supernaturally powered since the dinosaures. My pr! icipal is that to gain the superpowers you have in your dreams! like fl ying you have to be who you are in your dreams, the same ways not thinking about food or drinking since if we talk stricly good and evil it is evil to harm or kill an innocent being and we subconciously recognise that since plants are innocent beings especially seed that get eaten that is evil to eat a baby being. But in anycase you can tell i am making my way to the truly good line of life and not harming any of the innocent plants or animals, and i feel i may have been contacted with how slow it was going for a reason, who ever they are with how much death of innocent beings there is i have an idea we will be hearing from them, they may be really holy beings that don't eat anything at all and just take water and why they appear as orbs of light is they have gone fusion like the sun with the water in them some type of special fusion from being really holy, and who knows what type of being it could be , maybe one from a group a species that became immortalized and supernatur! ally powered enough to travel space flying and some stayed behind. ANyways as for profacies i feel the days are upon us and we will be hearing more from them, there will be leaders that stand up agist evil strickly like how the baby plant is an innocent baby and it is evil to kill it and stand up for all life and posiibly become supernaturally powered. oh i forgot i did have one other contact. i was at my house and one night i saw this white light jumping from tree to tree and heard abnormal sounds coming from the woods, there are woods off the back of my house at n6c 1x3 and it made a weird eching sound and it looked at one second like a white light body of this baby human that may be wild but looked like a ball baby sized of white light and it scared me it seemed very fast and the weird sound scared me and i can take a lie detector on either of these occurances, it dissapeared and i th saw the light reappear deeper in the woods, i was scared for i know its wrong to smoke ! and i thought it might be a being like made some of the shallo! w crater s on the moon that are wide for such shallowness from fushion meditation and i was smoking and i could heard the leaves move and then their was a creak from the fence like something was bhinde it , and it had been moving between treees in front of me, and that dissapearing move i thought it might have locked on to it's reappearpoint and was going to attack me for harming the one year old plants leaves when i should be holy for the planet then it made a sound and did the dissapppearing move and i heard another sound from behind the fence  and i pretty much ran in but as far as sky ufo's that yellow orb thing was the only time but this white light being or glowing being i saw a few times. i think it might be a holy protector of the planet i think that came to contact me to help my life. i saw it a few differernt days, it was white like lightening enery. I wasn't even thinking of that i had comppletely forgot, but i was thinking it some enlightened animal and it wasn't a sky uf! o but i am not lieing and i wrote this just like this you got the second on me remembering it's been like a year or more since then so i dunno how i forgot but i was thinking of just that sky ufo i had seen anyways if this helps you then good.

In my peripheral vision, I saw a left to right moving light (west to east). I thought immediately it was a satellite because there was an absence of sound.  I am always curious about moving objects in the night sky so when I was finished moving the squeegee down the mirror, I focused on the object.  Much to my surprise, it wasn?t one object; it was 3 spheres of light moving together in a triangle pattern.

I studied the objects and atmospheric conditions carefully.  I estimate they were 1500-2000 feet high, moving at about 100-200MPH.  The night sky was cloudless with winds blowing from the NW at about 15-20MPH. I estimate these spheres of light to be approximately 75-100 ft in diameter.  Let me emphasis, these objects were not points of light that you might see from a specific light source, such as the strobe lights on an airplane.  These were spheres of muted white light, 75-100 ft in diameter each. After 6 seconds, I was preparing to take a video with my iphone.  At 7 seconds, the objects vanished in a way that looked similar to the way people disappeared when in the ""transporter"" on the TV series ""Star Trek,"" not instantly, but over a period of about a second or so.

Let me just mention as background information: my father was a career Air Force NCO.  I grew up on Air Force Bases and around airplanes. I have observed airplanes both civilian and military all of my life (I am now 58 years old).  I have observed satellites since I was a kid.  I know what they look like and their predictable behavior.  This observation was unlike any in my past.  The soundless, formation flying objects were unlike any airplane(s) or satellites I have ever seen.  The fact that they were flying over one of the largest food warehouses on the east coast may just be coincidence, but maybe not.

I am not a Cooke but when I shared my observations with others that night, I was treated by some like I was.  I have never reported anything like this before.  This observation has shaken me because I cannot explain it and I am reporting it in hopes that somehow the information can be beneficial.","Truck Driver",0,3,"formation",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2011,2010,2,4,3,"Night","Northeast",1,0,0,0,0

On Saturday night, July 2, 2011, at approximately 8:00 or 8:15 p.m. I was driving back to my mother's from picking up some fast food. I was staying with her over the 4th of July weekend.  I saw 3 reddish-orange orbs.  They were very large.  

At first I thought they were from cell phone towers, so I did not think too much of them. As I mentioned, they were very large and they were not blinking as cell phone towers normally do.  

So I thought I'd pull over on the side of the road in her neighborhood and see if they moved.  To my surprise, they were moving very slowly across the sky.  The lights were sort of oval in shape.  The center was primarily reddish orange but there was a whitish or lighter color outside of the orange color.  There was no noise whatsoever.  

I watched them for approximately 3 minutes as they moved across the sky.  A car pulled in the neighborhood, so I needed to move my car.  When I finally reached my mother's house I couldn't find them again.

I have a keen interest in UFO's and sightings, and I tried to think of everything I could to explain what I saw.  The lights did not behave like traditional air craft lights.  They were much to big and they were not blinking.  Plus, I believe that aircraft would've moved faster across the sky.  They were not lights from a cell phone tower or from a satellite or star.  I'm telling you, these lights were very large.  

I wasn't going to report this until I spoke with my father today.  He said that he saw something similar last night in his area of town.  Apparently, he was watching some fireworks with his wife and neighbors and they saw them as well.  He said he even said, ""Hey, do you see that?"" to his neighbor about them. 

That's when I knew this was a significant event and that I needed to say something.  Be it extraterrestrial, military, or some other phenomenon, something out of the ordinary was going on that night.","Veterinary Assistant",1,3,"orb",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2011,2010,3,7,20,"Evening","South",1,0,0,0,0

Dear Mr. Davenport, I submitted my Sighting Description late last night and I am sorry, I made many grammatical errors. I went through my paper and have corrected them all.

Hello My name is ((name deleted)) and I observed for approximately 10 seconds, in great clarity, in extremely close proximity, a  very, very large chevron shaped unidentified flying object that flew completely from one horizon towards my position, virtually  directly over my head, to the opposite horizon until I could no longer see it, on August 3rd, 2011 in Key Largo Florida at  approximately 11pm at night.

My Background:  I was born in May of 1964 and raised in the Metro Detroit area.  I graduated from Western Michigan University in 1990.  I left the  Metro Detroit area and moved to Kansas City in September of 1996, and then finally re-located to Cape Coral, Florida in  September of 2000 where I reside today.  My occupation was in the restaurant/hospitality industry for most of my life and left that  behind when I became self-employed in March of 2004 as a Realtor in SW Florida.

As a young man growing up during the Apollo era, I have always had an interest in aviation, space flight, the planets, the moon  and the stars.  I became so interested in astronomy at a young age that my parents gave me a telescope for Christmas when I  was 9 years old.  I still have a 900mm telescope today, although it doesn't get used all that often anymore. At any rate, I have  observed the Moon and its mesmerizing  countless craters countless times.  I have visited Mars, Jupiter, Saturn with my telescope as well and their observable moons and gazed at the Horse Head Nebula, many stars and variety of other celestial objects.

Needless to say, I enjoy starring out into space and contemplating all of the greatest questions that confound mankind.  I am  always amazed that I am not seeing a picture of the present stars, but rather looking at a picture of the past stars, and of course its endless beauty.  In addition, through the years I have read books on astronomy, aviation and expanded my knowledge through  college academic's in calculus, physics and astronomy.

I am an aviation buff as previously mentioned, I have attended many aviation shows over the years and I can say that I am  probably more familiar with civilian and military aircraft than the average Joe on the street.  My son has been to 10 shows with me,  and he is now 12 years of age.  I have seen just about every type of current military aircraft that civilians are allowed to see, on the ground up close, as well as performing maneuvers for the crowd over the tarmac.

To finish the context of my background that is important for you to understand regarding how and why I was privileged enough to  witness this event, I must tell you a story of my past. One evening about 16 or 17 years ago I was laying in the grass at a rest  area with my then wife, outside the city of Detroit, to avoid the city lights. We were there, late night picnicking to observe a  meteor shower that we had discovered was happening, from a radio news broadcast we had heard a couple of days earlier. We  watched many shooting stars that evening, and noticed a bunch of small moving stars. We realized those slow moving stars were  not stars at all, they were satellites. Unexpectedly, I had found a new hobby that night, starring at the sky, in one direction for  long periods of time, then finding and watching satellites cross the sky. I thought that was so cool, to see something so small, so  far away, flying at 17, 500 miles per hour! It just brought me a little closer to outer space!  So, over the years while camping or at the beach, on the darkest of nights when the stars were at their brightest, my son and I  have laid on the ground and looked for satellites together many times. This night, last Wednesday, August the 3rd 2011 was not  our first time satellite gazing.

The Event:  My son Julian and I went to Key Largo, Florida on Tuesday August 2nd, 2011 for a two and a half day get-a-way, to celebrate the  end of his summer vacation. 7th grade was starting that follow Monday, so we had planned on doing some snorkeling and fishing.

Basically just goofing around and relaxing really.  So, on Tuesday morning we left for the ((name deleted)) Inn located at 97xxx   Hwy, MM 97.8 Bayside, Key Largo, FL 33037  Phone: (305) ((deleted))FAX: (305) ((deleted)). We arrived in the early afternoon,  check into the hotel and met up with some old friends. Then we proceeded to have a fun evening talking, walking on the small  dock and beach at the hotel and eventually went out to dinner that evening.

On Wednesday, August 3rd, 2011, we got up in the morning and went to the beach again. I ended up doing most of the real  snorkeling and attempted to do some spear fishing. ((name deleted)) spent most of that morning and afternoon tooling around the real  shallow waters close to the beach with just his goggles on.  Later in the afternoon I met a lady, a guest of the hotel, who was  drinking a beer in the hotel beach waters relaxing.  She talked about this and that, and went on and on, but the two things I  remembered from our short conversation was that she was from northern Florida, and the night before, Tuesday (when we were  out to dinner) she and her husband had been shark fishing off of the little dock at the hotel, and they had done pretty well  catching a few nice sized sharks.  Well, I knew at that moment that Julian and I would be doing some shark fishing that night. It  sounded fun, it was convenient and - well - I wanted to catch a shark too!   That night at about 10:15pm, Julian and I headed to the dock with 2 fishing rods fitted with metal leaders, a fishing tackle box, 4  cans of dog food for shark chum and a box of thawed squid for bait. When we arrived at the Dock there were other people their.

The lady from northern part of Florida (she was already fishing) and her son, a new female guest of Latino origin, and another  child I believed to be her son. So in total, there were 3 adults and 3 children. It was a beautiful evening almost completely clear  with a sporadic cloud now and again, but virtually clear. The two ladies were chit chatting away about this and that, the 2 other  boys were playing behind me. I wasn't really paying close attention to any of them at this time, as ((name deleted)) and I were setting our  gear down and getting ready to fish. Julian and I prepared our fishing rods. I went ahead and opened the cans of dog food and  threw the food into the water to bring the sharks closer to the shore. I then baited both fishing rods, each with one full squid and I cast the baits out into the Gulf of Mexico.  At that point, I asked Julian if he wanted to look for satellites and he said sure. So, Julian  and I laid down on the dock to begin looking, starring into the heavans...  NOTE: The docks shape is square and approximately 40'  X 40' and its orientation is such that if you were sitting at the end of the dock, on the edge, with your feet in the water, looking  straight out, you would be facing just about dead NW.  This is where I had cast our fishing rods out into the water. So when we  laid down on our backs, our feet were facing dead NW, with our heads pointed just about due SE.

Starring up at the zenith of the sky only after a few minutes, we spotted a tiny red dot, a satellite emitting this faint light, like a  faint star, but crossing the night sky.  As we watched it cross the sky, suddenly one of our fishing rods exploded with the fishing  line running out of the real at a very fast rate! We both jumped up to our feet, I pulled the rod out of it's holder and handed it to  my son.  The 2 other boys came running up to us to watch, and the 2 ladies were there already chit chatting away, now standing  next to us watching the fishing battle. Julian was wrestling with a fiend from the deep and he was loving it.  I had to take the rod  from him a few times to ensure the fish wouldn't wrap himself around a buoy and dock a couple of times, but ((name)) did most of  the work and pulled up to the dock a 4.5 foot Lemon shark. We tried to land the shark as the lady from northern Florida said she  wanted to keep it, but while I was trying to take the hook out of it's mouth and not get bitten at the same time, the shark shook  it's head and jumped off the hook. It fell into the gulf waters and swam off. I asked my son to grab another squid from the box, and I re-baited the fishing rod and cast the bait back out into the Gulf of Mexico.

The shark having swam off and the excitement over for the moment, ((name deleted)) began to hangout with the 2 other boys on the dock  behind me playing and talking. The were walking around the dock, then off the dock to the beach and back again to the dock  etc. The ladies still standing 5 feet away from me off to my right, went back into their conversation chit chatting away... I laid  down on the dock, back into my satellite hunting position.  My feet again pointing about due NW and my head about due SE.  The  lady from northern Florida still fishing as well. I starred straight up into the sky looking for movement in the stars, looking for  another satellite to show my son.

As the ladies were talking, the Latino lady mentioned something about God and the stars and heavan and then mentioned  something about the North Star, at that juncture I interjected in their conversation and I pointed out to them, how you could find  the North Star by looking at the two stars on the end of the cup of the Big Dipper.  I told them to find the Big Dipper, and then the  2 stars at the end of the cup and showed them how they pointed like an arrow to the North Star...  They didn't seem impressed,  So I laid back down on the dock looking straight up, looking and looking for another satellite to show Julian and his new friends...

This went on for about 30 minutes with no luck spotting another satellite.

I then caught movement out of the corner of my left eyes' peripheral vision.  Still lying flat on my back, I simply turned my head to  the left (looking just about due SW) and to my amazement I clearly saw a large, and I mean large, flat black object approaching  me, us, quickly.  If I had to judge the objects altitude at the moment I first saw it, it was about 15 degrees above the horizon (or  about a fist and a half at arms length).  The objects physical width was about a fists width across.  It was approaching fast, that's  why I noticed it. It blocked out the star light as it was moving.  Although I had been looking straight up all of this time, my eyes  were wide open and in-tune to the ambient light, so it was easy to see. I leaped to my feet (my entire body has goose bumps as I  am writing this - remembering) - I leaped to my feet, pointed directly at it and started yelling ""look, look, look, look, look, look,  look, at that!!! look, look, look, look, look, look, look, at that!!!"" I was yelling, keeping my finger pointed straight at the craft as it  approached, so that everybody who had not been looking up, could focus on it, could find what it was I was seeing approaching  us in the sky.

 It was moving quickly, straight, straight towards us, heading to be almost perfectly above us.... I wasn't paying attention to  anyone else so I really don't know what everybody elses locations were around me... all I could do was stare as it approached  very quickly, and I am yelling to everyone, I see it has lights underneath it. Not a lot of lights, maybe 5 or 6, white lights not too  big, kind of small actually, not flashing, but on - constant and white, they kind of look like the stars, running along the center line  of what I see, as it approaches - clear as if it were in day light - to be a chevron craft, huge, as it passes above me - it's size, its  wing span (for lack of a better definition) was... if you held your hands up to the sky and spread them apart 3 feet apart.  The  wings are perfectly symmetrical, the width from the leading edge to the lee ward edge was a fists width, the ends were square or  45 degree angles, they were not rounded like a boomerang.  It looks like a perfect chevron, with lights running across the center  line of the craft equidistant from each other.

 It's was huge - it's the size of a cruise ship in Key West. The real creepy part - it doesn't make a sound - I can't even hear wind  running over the body of it. I'm thinking ""it's not silent, it's more than silent - nothing - no sound - Just me yelling as it's passing  over head - almost as if it were suppressing the sound - as it passes above us I start say ""Do you see that?  What is it? Oh my God  what is that.....Do you see that!""  It's moving away - never slowing, never buffeting, no lights blinking - no sound - it's past me  moving away - NO EXHAUST... It has no exhaust, no sound... I'm yelling - ""look there"", pointing at it, never taking my eyes off of  it, as I hear the boys come running up. It's approaching a cloud to the NE... I'm yelling at the boys to look hard before it  disappears ""look, look...it's going above that cloud, look at the other side of the cloud maybe you will see it when it comes out the  other side...."" and it was gone.

It never slowed - it never turned - it passed almost directly above us, just so it's right wing tip was at the sky's zenith above me  and it's left wing tip directly away from me to the NW. It was flying on a course following the island from the SW to the NE.

After the experience, the Latino lady left quickly, I never saw her again a long with the boy that was with her. The other boy, the  northern Florida lady's son couldn't stop talking about it, what he saw, over and over again. I was dumb founded. I just shook my  head head and could not understand what I had just seen. The feeling reminds me of when I was told my older brother had died. I  didn't go into shock like frozen or start crying, I just was amazed, dazed. I ask everyone did you see that?... and everyone said  yes, but there answers washed over me - I went into shock by going about my business.... I checked the fishing lines, lit a  cigarette and laid down on the dock, looking at the sky. I ask Julian if he had seen it and he said he yes he had...

I started thinking ""was it a B-2 bomber? Could a B-2 bomber be flying that low? Why would a B-2 bomber being flying that low?? I  know B-2's are REALLY quiet, but could one fly that low and be SILENT?? No, it wasn't a B-2, when it flew over head it was a  chevron shape, didn't have the ""bat"" look with the B-2's ""W"" shaped tail end. There were no red and green navigation lights, just  the white lights across the center line or the entire mid line of the chevron shape...my mind was spinning... I went to our hotel  room, made a rum and coke and went back out to the dock. 15 - 20 minutes had passed. I laid back down on the dock, looking at  the sky, by the fishing rods smoking a cigarette. I asked the northern Florida lady, ""did you see that thing?"" that's all I could say...

I couldn't even have an intelligent conversation about it, I had to have been in shock now that I look back. I didn't even have the  sense to ask for the northern Florida ladies phone number. Why? I'm an intelligent person??  Around midnight Julian and I packed it up and went back to our hotel room and we went to sleep. The next morning we had to  drive back to Cape Coral. I had some work to do with a client on Friday, and I wanted to make sure Julian was all set for Monday  morning school. On the ride home I called and told one of my best friends and told him what happened and what I had seen. He  fully believed me, but after I hung up with him, I thought I best be careful who I talk to about this...

Friday, I had to talk to someone and get some answers, so I called the Monroe Sheriffs department, and I told them the basic  story. I asked if anyone had reported seeing an unusual object in the sky around 11pm last Wednesday night flying up the  coastline of Key Largo. The lady officer I spoke with actually took the time to ask around and check if any reports had been filed (I  didn't expect to get that much consideration with the story I had just given her) and she said no, but perhaps I should call  Homestead Air Force Base and see if the were conducting some sort of operations. So I did.

I called Homestead Air Force Base and kind of gave the gentleman on the phone the short version like ""I think I saw something  like a B-2 bomber flying low over Key Largo last Wednesday night..."" He said quite plainly and politely that Homestead did not  have any B-2's stationed there. I asked him ""would a B-2 be flying that low over the Island in any event?"" He said that he really  didn't know. So, I called the Key West Naval Air Station to see if they had tracked anything on radar that night. I ended up getting  a message machine in their ""public relations"" department. I left a message asking for someone to contact me, and that I had few  important questions to ask, but no one returned my call... So I told 3 more people over the coarse of the last 5 days. My cousin,  and 2 people at work. I then decided I need to call somebody who knows more about this stuff.

I contacted MUFON, and their investigator is out of town. Ann Castle, emailed me and said she would try to be in touch with me  next Monday. That's when I got back on line and found THE NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER. I recognized Mr. Davenport's  name from previous TV shows and articles I have read and decided to leave a message explaining what happened last week. and  there it is...

One of the things I keep thinking about over and over was how the object moved and looked as if it were a computer enhanced  image, almost like it was an image projected onto the sky because it was so perfect. It was like watching a space ship in a movie  theater, moving perfectly soundless, never fluttering, never buffeting, moving quickly - steadily, straight, soundless, moving  almost god like. OR, I guess you could say it looked like a ship in space, how once they are moving in a direction, they continue in  that direction unless acted on by another force. That's kind of the way it make me feel every time I reveiw the film in my head.

Seemed like nothing was pushing or pulling it, it was just momentum. Maybe that's why there wasn't any sound? Airplanes and  jets tend to dip a wing, make the air move, make some sort of sound... Every time I think of it, I get the goose bumps because  although it was completely absorbing, fantasinating and I feel privileged to have been in the right place at the right time - it was  still really very eerie...

One conclusion I have come to: If I was not looking up, I would have never had known it was there. No sound what so ever. It  would have passed right over all of our heads as we looked out on the water and never had a clue. Amazing. I have watched  every aviation program, every UFO program, every Big Foot Program etc...that has ever been broadcast on TV since I was a child.

I have always wanted to see a UFO. I have looked at the skies looking for a UFO's for years and years. I never thought I would  really see one. I cetainly never thought to be caught purely by surprize and have one fly so close to me, over head, and to be so  immense. I truely am privileged. It was the most awesome sight I have ever seen next to seeing my son being born!  In conclusion, all I can think is that I hope it's one of ours, because if it is - we have some bad-ass flying machines up there! If it  isn't one of ours, one can only speculate to the possibilities and implications... Thanks for taking the time to read this.

In the 1970's, I was about 15 yrs old, living north of Dayton in an area called Huber Heights, just several miles south of I-70. It was a crisp, cold, clear fall night. I walked out the back door to feed my dog, hurrying because it was cold and I didn't have a jacket.  I was maybe 20 feet from the house when something made me stop. (I'm getting shivers just remembering this) I looked up in the sky and almost overhead, hovering in total silence, was a large saucer shaped craft.  It seemed close enough to reach out and touch, but of course it really wasn't. It had trapazoidal shaped white lights? Or windows of light?, that rotated around the craft, from left to right, skipping every other panel. The trapazoids were narrower at the top, wider at the bottom.

I just stood there staring at it in total shock I guess, for who knows how long. I remember screaming, dropping the dog food and running for the house.

When I started running, it started moving, heading west at an extremely high rate of speed. Remember, I lived near Wright-Pat, had been to the Dayton Air Show, had seen fighter planes and the blue angels. I knew what a plane looked like in the sky. I had never seen anything moving at the speed this thing attained.

By the time I could get my father and air force uncle to the door, maybe a span of 20-30 seconds, it was nearly out of sight on the horizon. My uncle said he had never seen anything move so fast.

I have always wondered if anyone else saw anything in the sky that night in Ohio.

Later in life, I learned about Roswell, aliens, UFO's, and watched shows about Hanger 18 at Wright-Pat. I've wondered if this was reverse technology in action.

On 8-10-2011 I was in a fast food restraunt eating my meal when I observed an object approximatly two miles away.  At first I thought it was a stray balloon floating because it appeared as a dark circular object. The object approached on a course from the south west heading to the north east, eventually going straight above my vehicle.  As it approached I noticed that it did not act as a balloon would, like dancing in wind currents or rotating on it's axis.  This object stayed on a steady course and did not vary it's speed, alitude or direction.  There was a breeze at the time that I figured to be appx. five m.p.h going from the west to the east, that I thought would make a balloon go off course.

Hey I was watching tv a reality show called ""the great food truck race - episode rocky mountain highs and lows - s02e03"" and at about 2min: 3 sec I saw something weird.

It appears to be some object moving across the sky and great speeds and eventually disappearing into the horizon.  My wife thinks it's just a bird flying downward (huh?) but based on how its motion and perspective matches that of the horizon (with the jiggle of the moving camera) it appears to be in the distance.  It kinda looks like a rain drop moving down a glass at first, but not really as it dissapears very smoothly.

And I saw airplane lights but did not pay much attention.  I wondered why the plane was flying over the field. It was rush hour traffic. We picked up the food and headed back to Henderson.  I thought my daughter was going to take the highway home again, but she did not.  She went on the highway for a while than took a country road that had no traffic on it.  She slowed down her driving and was talking a lot to me. I had a strange feeling,  So I leaned forward in the car and looked up and saw lights above her car.

The craft was huge and boomrang shape and had 5 large round lights under it. and not flashing lights like our aircraft or a beam.

WAY DOWN YONDER IN THE CUCUMBER PATCH   Excitement loomed over the ((name deleted)) farm one spring when dad landed a contract with the local pickle factory in town.  Eagerly the ground was tilled with the team of work horses, Duke and Babe, pulling the one bottom plow through the fertile ground. I believe dad had set aside about 10 acres of which we planted all into cucumbers.  I may be wrong about the number of acres but I do know it was a huge amount. After turning the soil, a harrow was hitched behind the horses and dad went round and round, back and forth, over and over the field until the soil was loosened sufficiently for planting.  Each seed was placed carefully in mounds of soil by hand until the entire field was sowed.  I?m sure silent prayers were also uttered to the heavenly Father that he would bless this endeavor.  Anxiously we awaited the first sign of sprouts to poke their green heads from their graves.  The weather was perfect.  Gentle rain from heaven sprinkled at the opportune time.  Delightedly, one morning as ! we gazed out over the terrain, we saw a miracle had taken place overnight. God had awoken those seeds and the field was covered with pale green sprouts everywhere.  Each day we could see the progress of their growth as they grew larger and larger.  Along with the planted cucumber seeds there also grew tares in the field.  Dutifully, we shouldered our garden hoes each day to attack the formidable foe.  Countless hours were spent on our knees carefully pulling weeds from around the delicate and precious vegetation.  The promise of wages when the cucumbers were sold kept us at task.  

After weeks of heavy toil, the plants began to blossom and beautiful yellow flowers blanketed the landscape.  Shortly thereafter the blooms began to wither and tiny stubs appeared where the flowers had been. Every morning we hurried to the patch to see how quickly they grew. The day finally arrived when dad said, ?start picking.?  How exciting it was. Now we were going to benefit from the fruits of our la! bors and bring them to market. Visions of $$$$$ danced in my head. I w as going to be rich!!!! It was a tedious task.  They needed to be picked every day.  They could only be a certain size, not bigger or smaller.  Every day they needed to be brought to the pickle factory in town.  I began to be weary of this job, but I continued to labor knowing I would soon have some money of my own.

One day tiring of pick, pick, picking pickles, I laid down on my back between the rows, put my hands behind my head and rested for awhile.  As I gazed up at the cloudless, clear blue sky, my eyes were attracted to something directly above.  The sun was glinting off an object that was silver in color. It looked like a donut in the sky because I could see the blue sky through the hole in the middle. I lay there and watched for a very long time and it kind of frightened me because I had not seen anything like it before. Prior to this, in my life, I had not ever seen anything in the skies other than clouds and birds. It would be years later when I saw an airplane for the first time. I am unable to place a size or put a distance to this object but I recall that it stayed stationary for perhaps a half hour and then suddenly it was gone. What was it? UFO? Dad returned from town one day and proudly offered his closed fist to me. Holding my hand, he placed a $10.00 bill into it. Wow!!! $10.00!!! All my own!!! All my hard labor over the summer was worth it. Now I could buy whatever I wanted and there was more to come. The harvest was about half over when dad returned from selling the days harvest. With a long face he told us the pickle factory would no longer purchase any cucumbers from us because they had discovered some type of blight in them. Visions of becoming wealthy quickly dissipated. Oh, well, I still had my $10.00. Before I had a chance to go to town, my mother pleadingly asked me if she could borrow the money to buy some food. Reluctantly, I relinquished my treasure and I never saw it again. Times were very difficult in those days and even if I grudgingly gave up my hard earned cash, I knew she wouldn?t have asked for it if she didn?t really need it.

Note: After I wrote this story about 60 years later, my older brother and one of my older sisters told me they also remember the object, just the same as I described it.","Accountant",3,1,"other",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"We presume that this is intended as a serious report, but we can't be certain that is the case.

After looking through my gas and food receipts I was able to pin down the actual time of my sighting, at 8PM, just one mile east of XXX S Blake Ranch Rd, Kingman, AZ 86401-XXXX on the I40.

I saw what looked like 6 LARGE GLOWING PLASMA ENGINES flying over my car while driving west, just 15 miles east of Kingman AZ, 11.3 miles as the crow flies, to the Kingman airport.

I saw a giant craft that had 6 large rectangle panels on the back end, that were glowing blue white, like plasma engines.  It reminded me of  the ?Millennium Falcon"" from the Star Wars movies.  What first caught my eye was a sparking or flash on the bottom of the craft, as it moved over my car.  Then I saw two rows of 3 large rectangles, of blue white glowing light.

Each rectangle appeared to be house size.  They appeared to be at the rear of the craft as it moved away from me. It was amazing how big this looked to me, I said out loud to my self, ""I hope its one of ours"".  It looked like it was about 2000 feet up above me. I could not see the shape of the craft.

I was driving almost due West on I40 toward Kingman AZ. I had just passed US93 when I saw the electrical sparks through my windshield to my right.  It was flying along very slow for a jet and it had a ball of light traveling below it near the ground at the same rate of speed. You can see the ball in the first few frames of the video, but it might be a reflection.

I grabbed my video camera and while driving started taping.  At the beginning I passed a freeway sign, Blake Ranch Rd. Exit 1 mile. I recorded until just after I pass the exit, the craft was to far away, maybe 4 or 5 miles. It would have passed over or near the Kingman Airport.  Someone should check with them.

When I played the tape later in Needles at a gas stop, the time code showed I had traveled one mile in 32 seconds!  No freaking way, I would have had to be going over 100MPH.  I tested the camera and nothing wrong there.

I posted the video on YouTube, but its just shaky lights due to being hand held. I also posted this report before but it must have been taken down!  I no longer work for SAIC so I don?t care who know about this report. Originally I didn?t give my name or contact information because I was a contractor with the Navy.

I have worked on my video and tried to stabilize the lights the best I can. I will repost it soon.

I believe this craft was heading toward Area 51 after researching the angle of the flight and the city lights relative to its direction.

On the night of December 6, 2011, as I am traveling North of Chestnut Ave. coming from Alluvial in Fresno, CA heading to Sonic to buy food for my son, I seen an unidentified aircraft coming at me.  It was around 8:30ish.  There were hardly any stars in the sky, it was dark.  There were no cars in front of me or behind me, but cars coming from my opposite direction.  As I was driving up North towards Nees Ave on Chestnut, I saw a light coming somewhat straight at me.  At first, the thought came to my mind that it is an airplane crashing down, I felt somewhat scared.  I did not want to witness anything extreme at that moment.  The flying object as it descended from the sky, started slowing down and got bigger.  As it was getting bigger and getting close to me (feelings: very scared), I began praying for it to stop or just be close enough that I could see it, but not close to me as to like being in front of me.  I really did not want to get abducted, that was the next thought in my mind.  The UFO aircraft stopped and hovered for a few seconds.  As I was staring at it, my thoughts were ?Am I really seeing this?? the feelings of being shocked was trembling in my body.  My eyes were stuck at this unidentified aircraft, trying to figure out what this thing could look like, but all I seen was 3 circular lights, somewhat close together, shaped like a triangle, the lights looked as if it was spinning at a rapid rate, from red and blue, with traces of yellow light as it was glittering and spinning at a rapid rate.  The bottom of the craft looked like it had some rigid form structure around the lights. The UFO aircraft did not look large; it seemed somewhat medium/small size.  That was all that I seen from that... After a couple of seconds, maybe 15-20 seconds, it gradually started to move, to the right of my view, and curved up towards the sky.  It was lighting speed, it made traces of white light (like a tail of a star falling from the ! sky, except it was going up) as it ascended to the heavens.  I! never s een anything like it, or have I seen an aircraft as fast as that UFO craft traveled.  I?m still in shocked.  Today is December 8, 2011, 10:31AM.  I?m trying to recall my story of my first encounter of the flying object.","Recruiter",1,1,"unknown",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2011,2010,4,12,20,"Evening","West",1,0,0,0,0

I went outside to check some food I was cooking on my grill at exactly 8:00 pm.  I noticed that it was much brighter than earlier because the moon was visible in the NE sky (the cloud cover had mostly cleared).  As I was looking northward to see how much the cloud cover had cleared, I noticed a bright orangish light become visible over/between some houses to the NNW of mine.  The light was intensely orange, but not like a flare or roman candle, roughly roundish in shape, and initially was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arm's length (roughly a quarter-inch in diameter).  It initially attracted my attention because it was much brighter than the usual planes and helicopters that fly overhead, and because of the odd color which was unlike the usual air traffic.

The light appeared to arc upwards and towards me before moving parallel eastward above two houses across the street, then gained altitude and disappeared to the north.  It was visible for approximately two minutes, moving at a slow, steady pace.  As the light moved eastward, it became more yellow-orange in color (though orange was still the primary color) and seemed to strobe slightly or perhaps flicker like flame.

When I first saw the light, I watched it for 20-30 seconds before backing up on my deck to the door and yelling for my wife to come see it too.   She arrived promptly and was able to view it for approximately 45 seconds.  We went back in at 8:04pm after spending roughly 60 seconds after it disappeared watching to see if anything else became visible.

After thinking about it overnight, I suppose the object could have been a Chinese lantern.  The light never looked like flame and seemed a lot brighter than that relative to its distance, but I suppose it could have been a glow inside a paper orb.  The apparent direction (SouthEast, East, then North) could have been an illusion and the actual direction more of a straight eastward arc with the light burning brightly at first (thus larger), then lessening (thus seeming to move northwards).  However, if so the launch was pretty much a failure (the lantern would have risen in one neighborhood and burned out in another a mile or so apart).","IT Professional",2,1,"orb",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2011,2010,4,12,20,"Evening","Midwest",1,0,0,0,0

This article will give you some information about my sighting of the ""Moon of Memphis"" and topics that the spirits talk and focus on.  This article may seem to some to be a UFO religion but the information is UFO evidence and spirit communications designed to integrate into your present beliefs and religion, not to replace them.   Hopefully this UFO sighting and news will improve your belief and devotion to God, other people, and all things living.

 My UFO phenomenon began on the way to visit my grandmother in western Kentucky. We were riding north on Highway 51 late at night listening to the AM radio when we heard a news report of UFO?s seen in western Kentucky and western Tennessee. I looked out the back window at the stars above stating that I wish I could see a UFO. Twenty six days later I had my wish. I was back at home in Memphis when my mother asked me to take out the garbage at 10pm  Sunday 22 November 1964. I went out back and I looked up and saw a white full moon above then I looked around and to the east I saw an orange moon rising. I looked back above and noticed the white full moon shaped UFO again for a few minutes until it ascended in the sky looking like a bright star at high altitude. I believe this phenomenon was outside of my head and it was fantastic.  Since it appeared over the Holy Hills of the Frayser community of Memphis, I call it the ""Frayser Fatima"" of the ""Moon of Memphis"".

 At 10pm 22 November of 1964 in Memphis Tennessee (USA), I was asked by my mother to take out the garbage. I went out back and I noticed a bright white full moon above. I looked closer and I noticed it had uniform whiteness with well define circular outline but I was not able to see the shades of white or grey that made the man in the moon face. It was equally as bright as the real full moon, bright enough to create a moon shadow. I looked around and I noticed another moon that was bright orange. This other moon was rising over our neighbor's house to the east, as I looked through the side yard from the back yard to the front. It had the features that created the man in the moon, so I believed that it was the real moon. I looked above and stared again at the white full moon for a few minutes, then it made a rapid ascend in the sky. I estimate the ascend speed between 180 to 300 knots.  As it rose, it became a smaller and smaller moon until it appeared to looked like a bright ! star, then a dim star, then disappeared into space. It reminded me of the Star of Bethlehem when it was at high altitude.  The event occurred within a mile of the Area 51 of Tennessee, that is near Highway 51 over the Holy Hills of the Frayser neighborhood of Memphis, Tennessee and the event lasted about fifteen minutes.

 I was only seven when I witnessed this UFO that I now call the ""Moon of Memphis"". I had a good memory of the event so that when I was trained in the Air Force as an instructor navigator, I was able to analyze the event better with my aviation experience. I estimate that the ""Moon of Memphis"" was at twenty thousand feet and was about ten acres in size. I developed this information from watching the ascend of the ""Moon of Memphis"" through some high cirrus clouds that I estimate was at sixty thousand feet. At twenty thousand feet it would have taken four 747 aircraft parked in a circle to cover the area of the ""Moon of Memphis"" UFO, thus creating a ten acre size estimate. When it hovered above me and 10 ten degrees south, it was exactly the size and shape of the real moon when seen high in the sky.  Most observers probably could not tell the difference between the ""Moon of Memphis"" UFO and the real lunar moon when it's hovering above.

  In 1964 the ?Moon of Memphis? appeared at 10 pm 22 November over the city of Memphis. It was a night with two moons in the sky, the ?Moon of Memphis? overhead and the lunar moon rising in the east. There is significance to this event because the timing of the event has biblical implications. First it appeared in 1964 which can be analyzed to derive meaning. If you take the alphabet and match the letters with numbers then you can derive a numeric number for words. I analyzed many religious words and I found two that are interesting. The English words ""Israel"", ""Zion"" and ""Jeshua"" decodes to 64 sixty four. Israel is a word that has meaning to the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions. The word Zion is a word that means Israel and Jerusalem in particular. In Revelations of the Bible, there is writing about a New Jerusalem or a new Zion. Could the timing of the ?Moon of Memphis? mean that it was God?s New Jerusalem or Zion?  ""Jeshua"" is the Messiah of Israel that was translate! d to mean Jesus Christ.  The day of the month was the 22 twenty second which added to 11 eleven for the month of November equals 33 thirty three which is a religious number for the English word ""Amen"" and the crucifixion date of Jesus was 33 AD. If you count the 22 November to 25 December, then you will have 33 thirty three days.  Twenty two is also the sum of the word ""Lead"".  If you take the numeric sum of the appearance date: 11-22-1964, you get 26 which is the sum of the words ""God"" and ""heal"".  Also, my birthday 11-04-1964 of that year also added up to 26 and will always be the sum of the ""Moon of Memphis"" appearance anniversary which helps explain why I was given the honor to view it.   Lastly, the decoded English word ""Mercy"" equals 64 sixty four.

 The UFO event occurred at 10 pm. Ten coincides with the English letter ?J? which could mean Jewish, Jehovah, or Jesus.  The sum of the word ""ten"" equals 33 thirty three, a number often associated with Christ.   If we added the 10 ten to the 64 sixty four then we would get 74 seventy four. Seventy four has some religious meaning. The English words ""Messiah"", ""Jesus"", ""Cross"", and ""Jewish""  decodes to 74 seventy four. Seeing meaning presumes that God intended for the year and time numbers to be added together. If we subtract 10 ten from 64 sixty four we get 54 fifty four. The English words ""Islam"" and ""Love"" adds up to 54 fifty four.  If you take the number of witnesses of the event 1 one and subtract 64 sixty four then you get 63 which is the sum for the words ""Saint"", ""try"", ""gentle"", ""agitate"", and ""Divine"". If you add the numbers of 1964, you get 20 twenty and if added to 64 sixty four you get 84 eighty four which is the decoded sum of the English words ""Savior"", ""evolved""! , "" Patmos"", ""forty"", and ""Charity"".   If you add 33 thirty three to 64 sixty four you get 97 ninety seven and the English words ""convert"", ""story"", ""buildings"", ""control"", ""sixty"" and ""Hinduism"" equals 97.  If you decode the English word ""November"" the you get 94 ninety four which is also the decoded sum of the English word ""respected""; if you add the 10 ten to 94 ninety four then you get 104 one hundred four which is the decoded sum of the English word ""Jerusalem"".  If you take the decoded sum of the English word ""Memphis"", you get 83 eighty three which is also the decoded sum of the English words ""percent"", ""prayer"", ""prepared"", and ""South""; and if you subtract the time 10 ten then you get the sum 73 seventy three which is the decoded sum of the English words ""Joseph"", ""children"", ""thanks"", ""nation"", ""living"", and ""Ezekiel"";  If you take the sum of ""America"" which is 50 fifty and add 33 thirty three you get 83 eighty three for the sum of ""Memphis"".  If you add my age at ! the time of the event 7 seven to 64 sixty four you would get 7! 1 sevent y one which is the decoded sum of the English word ""spirit"" and ""Temple"".  If you subtract my age 7 seven from 64 sixty four then you get my birth year of 57 fifty seven which is the decoded sum of the English words ""Moon"", ""Jews"", ""Bless"", ""Mary"", ""birth"", ""human"", and ""city"".  I hope this analysis can help you understand the religious nature of the ""Moon of Memphis"" appearance of God which seems to reach out to believers of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and others.

  This witness of the event was born on 11-04- 1957 and 57 fifty seven is the numeric sum of the English word ""Moon"" and the English words ""Bless"", ""Mary"",  ""birth"",  ""city"" and ""Jews""  which suggest that we should bless Mary and birth city of Jesus the Christ and Messiah.  The sum of my birth date is 28 which is the sum of the word ""Eden"".   Also English may have been chosen because England equals 57 fifty seven.  If you take the difference between 64 sixty four and 57 fifty seven you get 7 seven which subtracted from 57 fifty seven you get 50 fifty that decodes the words ""America"", ""second"", ""lands"", and ""helped"".  If you take the sum 67 sixty seven of my last name ""Bickers"" which is also the sum of the English words ""trees"", ""West"", and ""work"",  and add the time 10 ten, you get 77 seventy seven which is the sum of the English words ""Christ"",  ""wrong"", ""Power"", ""character"", ""Taoism"", and ""Judaism"".   If you take the sum 79 seventy nine of my first name ""William"" which also d! ecodes the English words ""Nature"", ""hereby"", and ""Virgin"", and subtract the time 10 ten then you get 69 sixty nine which is the sum of the English words ""message"", ""animals"", ""redeemed"", ""people"" and  ""Jehovah"". If you add 10 ten to 79 seventy nine, you get 89 eighty nine which is the sum of the word ""religion"".   If you take my middle name ""Harding"", it decodes to 61 sixty one which is also the sum of the English word ""Church"". If you subtract the time 10 ten you get 51 fifty one which is the sum for the English word ""Thor""; and if you add the time 10 ten you get 71 seventy one which is the sum for the English words ""Zeus"", ""spirit"" and ""Temple"". If you take the sum of the neighborhood of the event Frayser then you have 92 which is the sum of the word ""reasonable"".   In addition, my initials WHB equals 33 thirty three and the English word AMEN equals 33 thirty three which is also associated with Jesus' crucifixion date (33 AD).  I am also 1/64 Native American (Cherokee).  ! Lastly the event was seen on a street called ""Leweir"" which d! ecoded t o 72 seventy two and it is also the decoded sum of the English words ""monks"" and ""world"". If you add the time 10 ten to 72 seventy two, you get 82 eighty two which is the decoded sum of the English words ""forgive"", ""Eastern"", and ""saints"".  If you subtract 10 ten from 72 seventy two then you get 62 sixth two which decodes to the English words ""gives"", and ""Think"".  These religious words decoded from my birth year and name may be factors in understanding why I was chosen to view the event and evolved into an UFO Prophet, Ambassador and Messenger of God.

  Why was the city of Memphis chosen in 1964?    Several highways enter Memphis with interesting meanings and if you take the number, add or subtract the time of the event 10 PM to the highway number and match with the sum of words. Highway 64 and the event occurred in 1964 plus 64 decodes to the English words ""Mercy, Israel, focus, attend, never, and Zion""; If you add 10 to 64 you get 74 for the words ""Messiah"", ""objects"", ""abortion"", and ""Jesus"";  If you subtract the event time 10 from 64 you get 54 which decodes to ""Islam"", ""those"", ""Gabriel"", ""right"", and ""Love""; Highway 51 which like Area 51 can be suggestive of UFOs and 51 decodes the words ""Michael"", ""Indian"", ""saved"", ""Fatima"", ""avoid"", ""preach"", ""more"", ""Great"", ""Dixie"", and ""Catawba""; If you subtract the event time 10 from 51 then you get 41 which decodes to ""good"", ""fun"", ""gone"", and ""King""; Interstate I-40 which 40 decodes the word ""Buddha"" suggesting peace and harmony and the words ""Holy"", ""asked"", ""seek"", ""harm"",! and ""Maya""; If you subtract the event time 10 from 40 you get 30 which decodes to ""Peace"", ""Bible"", and ""due"";  Highway 70 and decodes to the English words ""Yahweh"", ""honor"", and ""Cherokee""; If you add 10 to 70 then you get 80 which decodes to ""Throne"", ""Creator"", ""values"", ""your"", ""miracles"", ""wildlife"", and ""religion"";  If you subtract 10 ten from 70 seventy you get 60 sixty that decode the words ""over"", ""mislead"", and ""believe"". Highway 57 and decodes to the English words ""Bless, Mary, Birth, City, Jews, Human"", and ""Moon""; If you subtract 10 from 57 you get 47 which decodes to ""Beast, Radio, Judge, obey, Isaiah, John, and Osage""; Interstate 55 and decodes to the English words ""Heaven"", ""Aztec"",  ""show"", ""part"", ""sky"", and ""Satan""; If you add 10 to 55 you get 65 which decodes to ""Seven""; Subtract 10 ten from 55 you get 45 which decode the words ""say"", ""Daniel"", and ""East""; Highway 72 and decodes to the street where the event was witnessed ""Leweir"" and the English words ! ""Judging"" and ""World""; If you subtract 10 from 72 you get 62 w! hich dec odes to ""Think"", ""first"", ""Comanche"", and ""tribal""; If you add 10 to 72 you get 82 for the word ""forgive"";  Highway 61 and  decodes to the words ""Church"", ""Roman"", ""sins"", ""coming"", ""homes"", ""UFOs"", ""Yankee"", and ""Navaho""; If you add 10 to 61 you get 71 which decodes to ""Catholic"", ""forget"", ""Moses"", ""advocate"", ""native"", and ""Pueblo"";  Highway 14 and 14 decodes to the English word ""Dead""; Highway 79 and decodes to the English words ""Nature"", ""should"", ""words"", ""your"", ""honored"", ""elaborate"", ""Cheyenne"", and ""Quapaw"";  If you add 10 to 79 you get 89 for the sum of the words ""hunting"", and ""honors""; If you subtract 10 from 79 you get 69 for the words ""Jeremiah"" and ""enjoy""; Highway 78 and decodes to the name of the Native Indian tribe of Memphis region, the ""Chickasaw"" and the words ""repent"", and ""enjoyed""; If you add 10 to 78 you get 88 which decodes to ""Woodland"", ""Sikhism"", ""peoples"", ""nothing"", and ""Ghosts""; Highway 86 which decodes the words ""Mounds"", ""insight"", ""waters""! , and ""souls"". If you add 10 to 86 you get 96 for the word ""opposes"".  These are most of the highways in Memphis and may be important clues relating to the ""Moon of Memphis"" UFO event.  The ""Moon of Memphis"" also represents the Great Spirit of the Chickasaw, Cherokee, Quapaw, Navaho, Catawba, Mounds, Osage, Pueblo, Woodland, Cheyenne, Comanche, Maya, Aztec, and other tribal Indian peoples.

 Using many of the words decoded, this is a possible message:  To the peoples of the world, I William of the Divine God, the Holy Spirit, the Great Spirit, and the Good Creator greets you with this message and Fatima. The 1964 ""Moon of Memphis"" honors the Messiah Jesus Christ, the Savior in Spirit and the Virgin Mary, the Holy Mother.  Jehovah and Yahweh of the Jewish people of Israel and Zion gives thanks to Joseph, Mary, Jesus, the birth city of the Savior's spirit, the Cross, and Jerusalem. The  peoples of religion of Christ, Judaism, Islam, Taoism, Sikhism,  Hinduism, Buddha, the Great Spirit and more should show love, peace, honor, and charity as asked from your Good Creator of the ""Moon of Memphis"",  over America.   Also say a prayer, bless, and show mercy to animals; plus enjoy and forgive children . Trees and nature should also be enjoyed and respected.  Avoid the beast and harm nothing; if you do harm, be prepared to elaborate to a spirit.    Always love the message of Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Daniel, and Isaiah; plus the story of Mo! ses and of Elisha.  Obey the God and power of the ""Moon of Memphis"", which can think and radio to humans,  and is our Savior in Spirit.  Messiah Jesus Christ, the King on his thrown, is helped by those who preach, believe, and convert in the East, West, and South; by those who attend or lead a Bible Church, the Eastern Church, a Catholic Church or the Roman Catholic Church; and due to the work of saints, Saint Gabriel, and the Archangel Saint Michael.   Beware of Satan and in Heaven we are judging the living and the dead.  First repent of your sins, then the Jesus the Christ, your advocate, will forgive you,  forget your sins, and try to heal you.  Preach the gospel and seek insight on the Bible.  Focus on and believe in the words and values of the Messiah Jesus Christ. Saint John of Patmos was mislead; Jesus Christ, the Messiah and a part of God, was never gone so this is a gentle second coming.  UFOs are miracles of God. Abortion is wrong but birth control is right.  God ! opposes hunting wildlife for fun.  Monks should agitate huntin! g.  Use at least forty percent of your nation for native nature and wildlife.  The souls and ghosts of the living and the dead of animals, humans, homes, buildings, objects, lands, sky, waters, and trees of good or reasonable character of this world, respected by the Great Spirit, the Holy Spirit, and the Good Creator of the ""Moon of Memphis"" of 11-22-1964, are hereby honored, redeemed, and saved by your Divine God.

 The ?Moon of Memphis? was possibly the same object as the ?Star of Bethlehem? but at a much lower altitude. The Book of Mormon states that a bright light appeared in the sky over Bethlehem. Was this the Star of Bethlehem at a much lower altitude like the ?Moon of Memphis?? The ?Moon of Memphis? ascended and appeared as a bright star until it ascended out of sight. The symbol of Islam is the moon and star. Was the ?Moon of Memphis? trying to send a meaning to Islamic believers? At high altitude it appeared like a bright star reminding me of the ?Star of David? or the ?Star of Bethlehem?. It seems that the ?Moon of Memphis? was trying to relay meaning to all of the religions of Zion; Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  The ""Moon of Memphis"" may also be trying to connect with those who believe in the Wicca religion or those who worship the Great Spirit in Native American religions, and Indian religions.  The rising to space of the Holy and white circular ""Moon of Memphis"", symbo! lically suggest the body of Christ being taken by God to the heavens as a communion act and evidence of Jesus Christ being accepted as a Lord and Savior of Earth.  If you see the communion wafer used by the catholic church, then you can imagine what the Holy ""Moon of Memphis"" looked like in the sky.  This event also suggest that the ""Star of Bethlehem"" appeared as a very bright star from a distance but appeared as a full white moon to the people directly under it giving a moon-like light to the community below and baptizing the people with the Holy light of God.

 Was the ?Moon of Memphis? a sign to tell the believers of all religions that they have a common God who is known by many names? Was it a sign of peace or the return of the messiah? Much change in the human condition have occurred since 1964 suggesting that it meant both a sign of the living God and his commitment to the earth to improve the world. Was the appearance over Memphis, Tennessee (USA) a sign that God has chosen that city as the New Jerusalem mentioned in Revelations of the Bible? This city may very well be a gateway to heaven. Something to think about if you really want your prayers heard. It might be a city worthy of a pilgrimage.  The message analyzed from this event seem to suggest that the event symbolized a common God of all religions, peoples, and life.

 The ?Moon of Memphis? is a sign, the lamb of God, of the return of the Messiah for it is written:  Revelation 21:23 ?The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb is its light.

 Revelation 22:5; ?There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for ?the Lord God gives them light? And they shall reign forever and ever.

 With the ?Moon of Memphis?, the New Jerusalem will be made and with its power, the people will have light. This Holy city may not come about anytime soon according to scriptures, but the ?Moon of Memphis? is proof that God can make good his promise to bless this new city with heavenly light not from the sun or the moon. Since the ?Moon of Memphis? appeared over Memphis, Tennessee (USA) in 1964, it is possible that this city is similar to the New Jerusalem, an important city of God. The ?Moon of Memphis? proved in 1964 to produce light as bright as the moon and I suspect that it could produce a much brighter light if it had to. It is a commitment to the earth to always be with us during good times and bad times. The ?Moon of Memphis? is the lamb of God and also the Holy Grail or Holy light of Christ. Celebrate and be exceedingly joyous of the truth and existence of the ?Moon of Memphis?.  As a seven year old boy, I was baptized by the light of the lamb, the Holy light of God.

 In the Bible, Luke 24:51, ?Now it came to pass, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and carried up into heaven.?  This was the Ascension of Jesus and a phenomenon that I want to discuss. It is my assertion that Jesus went into something like the ?Moon of Memphis? of 1964. The ?Star of Bethlehem? which was similar to the ?Moon of Memphis? had to of descended to a low altitude to be carried up into heaven. Though nothing was mention of a craft, the event suggests that such a event had to have happen for this to be true. As a witness the ?Moon of Memphis?, I believe that the ?Star of Bethlehem? was the same object as the ?Moon of Memphis? and it actually took Jesus aboard so Jesus could establish his church and religion from celestial assistance. The success of the religion also suggest that a higher power and probably from what we now call UFO assisted Jesus as God in his mission. If this is what occurred then it would also suggest that the ?Moon of Memphis? was the second coming of Jesus in the spirit. I believe that the Messiah,  Jesus Christ, returned to the earth in 1964 and we are li! ving in a new age of life.

 God chose one individual to witness the return of the Messiah.  Jesus said in Matthew 5:8 ""Blessed are the pure in heart:  for they shall see God"".  Maybe the Spirit of Jesus of the ""Moon of Memphis"" felt that I was pure in heart as a seven year old boy.  Like the first visit to earth, the messiah chose a simple humble and meek way to make his return known. Also, the Messiah, Jesus Christ, had the privacy to work with humanity to make it more peaceful and comfortable. Most would have expected a more visible and public return but that would also cause many to resist change and expect instant success. God chose a seven year old boy to show his presence and return and much change has occurred over the past few decades. Glory to God and we welcome the return of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who returned in the ""Moon of Memphis"" in the spirit to be a partner to humanity and all life to make the world better. Amen.

 The historic battle of Armageddon was probably the famous Six Day War of Israel in 1967.  This war fulfilled prophesy and it occurred just several years after the return of Jesus Christ's spirit, the Messiah, and other new Messiahs that came in the ""Moon of Memphis"" event.  Apparently Jesus knew that with the turmoil in the world and Middle East, He and other Spirits of God had to appeared or return to work with this earth to make it more peaceful.  The Cold War with the Soviet Union and China were also very serious concerns to God.  Many prayed to God and Jesus to help and their prayers were answered with the ""Moon of Memphis"" appearance and influence.  Maybe prophesy of gloom were indicators when Godly influence was necessary to help humanity.  Maybe every generation in need get their own second coming of Jesus or appearance and influence of God.  For this generation the 1964 appearance of the ""Moon of Memphis"" was our second coming of Jesus and coming of new generations o! f Spirits of God made from collected spirits from the best of God's creation and the best of humanity.

 In the New Testament book of Revelations from the Bible, John of Patmos may have been mislead because of his association of disasters and end of the world in association with the return of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ had a good character and kind personality and his return has created a world that is more in tune with him as a Messiah and a Savior.  To believe that Jesus has not returned or has ever left the world is to believe that Jesus Christ is not a part of God.  The Divine God of many names and those who believe that Jesus Christ was gone did not fully understand his Divinity and constant presence on this earth both in word from the Gospels and in the Spirit as God.  The ""Moon of Memphis"" event is proof that God and Jesus Christ in Spirit is here on this earth and the true antichrists would make you believe that Jesus as a part of God was ever gone to begin with.  This is why John of Patmos vision may be a seed of Satan designed to make you fear Jesus Chris! t as a part of God or wish the end of this beautiful world.

 God with Jesus Christ as the Son of God, known by other names in various religions, have worked hard to make this world better.   Do not be so vain as to think that humanity did it all alone without God.   We see the understanding and appreciation between nations and cultures; we see many nations dedicated to preserving peace and cooperation; we see much charity from many nations to other nations; we see animals receiving preserves and protection; we see kinder view of other religions; we see advancement in construction, science and technology; we see the human race living more comfortable and entertained; we see cooperation between nations to prevent and resolve issues of war;  we see remarkable improvement in medicine and health;  we see racial and sexual equality; and we see the advancement of food production. These are but a few of the many things that also truly mark the return of the Messiah for Christians and coming of the Messiah for other religions. A true sign of G! od, the ""Moon of Memphis"" is a sign that a kind God is with us and dedicated to all things living. Do not follow prophets of gloom, but understand that disasters are natural phenomenon that can not easily be predicted but we can overcome the trauma with our faith in a kind God and Messiah. The best of your religion will not fail you if you try to be kind in every way and not lose reverence to our kind lord, our God.

 Since I was fortunate enough to witness the appearance of the light of the lamb, the ""Moon of Memphis"",  God and Jesus Christ love the world so much but understand the need for some to have the Revelations prophesy of John of Patmos fulfilled so the prophesy was completely fulfilled within the mind of me, William of God.  Within my mind was a world or earth that the spirits had made and everything that Revelations said would happen, did indeed happened according to scripture and prophesy.  I read Revelations in the New Testament and some of the events were in the physical world like visiting Whitehorse, Yukon twice without understanding the scripture significance of the White Horse.  Other event occurred with spirit visions in my mind that I could see and monitor.  This completed the Second Coming events of Revelations and allowed God and Christ to work with the world and earth of those who had not witnessed the Second Coming event of Jesus to use character, logic, reason, a! nd grace to help humanity to improve the world and work to make a heaven on earth for as many people and earthlings as possible.  The activities of God and Christ continues to this very day working with the spirits and humanity to make a peaceful and wonderful world for all life both physical and spiritual.  Minutes after this paragraph was added to this article, I heard a loud boom and power was cut from my residence and neighborhood at 1507 or 3:07 PM this clear sky Friday 18 November 2011.  By using his power to affect the transformer, God is saying that he is powerful and a transformer of life.

 In 1990 at age 33 thirty three,  I was traveling to Washington, D.C. to my next assignment at USCG Headquarters.  I was on a highway from Florida north to Washington D.C. when I decided to say a prayer to God to help me on my next assignment.  At the moment that I said ""AMEN"", something happened.  My fingers were froze in the extended position and I went blind for almost my total vision. I could see just a little through a small tunnel and the rest of my vision was red.  It was just enough vision to get off the expressway where I stomped the brakes and waited fifteen minutes for my vision to return and my fingers to return to normal.  The phenomenon could have been a strike of lightening or it could have been just a mind phenomenon but when my vision and movement of my fingers became normal I was able to hear the voices of angels.

 At age 33 thirty three the spirits of the Lord started to speak with me after being blinded for fifteen minutes after a prayer to God. The spirit gave revelations to me and in 1997, 33 thirty three years after the event,  a color vision of ""Jesus Christ"" appeared to me. Jesus talk many days with me about life on the earth and problems that exists with all of God creations.  Christ basically said God wanted humanity to be more reverent to all living beings and animals. The consciousness of each being or animal is precious and must be respected more. Before animals are killed, they should receive anesthesia and be put into a deep sleep. Anything less is cruel, heartless, and disrespectful  to animal rights and  to God.  Humanity should find a way to eat without killing animals, but until then, we must not kill an animal while it is awake. Treat innocent animals as you would like to be treated if you were in their place.  Many species of animals have a covenant with God that if! they are well protected and allowed to become numerous with the help of humanity,  then they will give their life when required to help humanity and earn a right to live in the heavens made for them.  At times some species are favored over humanity to help them, protect them, and increase their numbers.   If you put a human brain the form of most animals they would probably act as the do now.  To have dominion over other living creatures or animals requires that you treat them as you would like to be treated and that should be with kindness and mercy to avoid God's judgment or wrath against you.   The ""Moon of Memphis"" is proof that God does exist and we should obey Christ's message for us to be more kind to each living being and animals.

 Each species of animals have their own lifespan which also dictate the time necessary for the young to be raised.  During their lives they have challeges that require much intellect.  The challenges of finding food, of social behavior, of mating, and of parenting their young.  Many species show much success, devotion, and intellect compared to many humans that exist in this world.  Though they have a smaller brain, they seem capable of showing human-like intellect.  This is because they have a God that assist them like humans or they somehow have human spirits in their minds.  God must create mind waves that help animals in a similar manner as God helps humans.  Because they have a God influenced mind from everything that exist, they must be revered more.  Human bigotry against animals is a form of prejudice that causes many humans to be heartless against them and for other humans as well.  If God shares it's mind with other forms of life, then do you think that God respects! those who seem to be insensitive, heartless, or cruel to other God influenced life.  An animal with a shorter life span probably values it's short life even more than humans.  It's life is precious and many religions totally ignore the santity of life of other earthlings to the point that they disrespect and get cursed by their God that suffers in these other harmed earthlings.  Those that connect true character with the respect and reverence of every form of life will be blessed, those with careless prejudice engrained through culture and religion will find their lives afflicted with pain and sorrow.  Nature is not dead in the mind but a very conscious and active God-like mind that will make life and death decisions based on the management of the various species.  Will the grim reaper think that you as an overpopulated human a kind credit to earth and it's many species or will you have to be weeded out with bad luck, disease, or spiritually warfare because of your heartle! ss closed mind to other living kinds of life.  If you neglect ! to learn from this article, then you many suffer a fate with a delusion that God doesn't truely exist and then suffer the consequences of nature.  If you are wise then you will learn that everything that exist is alive in its own frequencies and probable have a human or God like intellect that must be respected which includes each species of animals, trees, structures, lands, and even sky.

 Jesus' birth in a wooden manger full of animals represents the specialness that Jesus' mind and nature had in common with the other special creatures of the earth; the animals and the trees.  His mission of salvation was meant for all things and life of the Earth and God.  He died to show us what was happening to the animals and trees who were very alive and needed humanity's love and understanding.  They needed help, respect, and salvation.  True salvation comes from understanding what God and Jesus was trying to tell humanity and only by kindness, respect, love, and avoiding harming these creations and life can God and even Satan give you peace.  Through the Christ power, the mind and spirit of trees, land, waters, and good animals have God's power and dominion over humanity and lesser spirits and lords to protect and preserve nature and require mercy and spiritual equality with humanity.  Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection helped Jesus Christ to experience and unde! rstand what all life that is sacrificed and harmed experienced thus helping him as Lord and God to minister to the life that suffers and to strengthen his resolve to protect better and defend the life of animals, trees, humans, or spirits.  To avoid curses, retribution, and suffering, you must not harm anything because any harm has a price upon humanity and yourselves.  Those with a true love for Jesus and those he represent will find forgiveness and salvation; however, as he once stated, ""what you do to the least of mine people, you have done unto me"".  The manager full of animals and wood of trees with Jesus born to their witness reflect the people of Christ needing salvation and appreciation.  The enemies of the living things and creatures of earth; humanity and their spirits, also needed salvation for their sins against others that they harmed for their needs. Jesus showed the peoples of Christ how to face death, forgive those who harmed and killed you, and the miracle ! of resurrection by God that will be given to those good beings! who are sacrificed by God and humanity.  The Communion is remembering and honoring not only Jesus Christ but all life that is sacrificed for humanity and God's will for this world.

 God wants people to be at peace with those who worship God in other religions. If a person or nation is reasonably kind regardless of their understanding of Allah or God, you should be friends with them. Do not war or jihad against reasonably kind and friendly individuals or nations. Work within yourself to be kinder and a better example of kindness to others and to animals. God?s character of kindness is true so do not follow those who urge you to harm or terrorize. God blesses any belief, religion, or culture that teaches kindness to others and to animals. Those who are mean spirited and cruel are not blessed by God and do not be deceived or lead by such individuals or organizations.

 God believes that he has been fair in sharing the lands of Israel and Palestine. He believes that the followers of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are the chosen people or Jews. Each is a religious belief of Jews of Allah or God with Holy books to learn of Allah's or God's will for you. Since Christians and Muslims are also Jews, Allah or God have allowed the religious and peaceful individuals access to these Holy Lands. Anyone near the Holy Lands of Israel or Palestine who is not a kind peaceful person will be cursed by God or Allah for violation of the peace and good will that God commands for all the Jews - the Bible Jews, the Koran Jews, and the Torah Jews.  God kept his promise to give the lands of Canaan to the Jews and he has done precisely that.

 The Lord God asked Noah of the Bible and Torah to take care of wildlife.  The spirits of the Lord of the ""Moon of Memphis"" wants you to also help animals and plants and give land back to wildlife.  If you own a large section of land then give at least 40 percent to the wildlife.  Forty was chosen because it would create refuges all over the country side for the wildlife and plants to flourish and survive.  The word ""Buddha"" equals 40 and he would say 40 percent would make the most peace and harmony.  Forty is also associated with Jewish and Christian religions.   If you own small parcels of land then serious consideration should be given to allow the land go wild.  You can even plant some fruit and nut trees to help feed the wildlife.  If the animal has wings, then they must be Angels of Nature.  If you have a city or town lot and home, then try to feed the birds or angels to receive a special blessing from the Lord.  Your offering to the creatures of God in the form of food! and land will ease your spirit and soften your heart to all matters concerning life.  Your health will improve and you will receive blessings from God and you will help make amends for the sins that you want forgiven.

 Many human illnesses, war, sin, and crime are caused when the spirits and God of land, fields, waters, trees, and animals war against humanity for cruel conduct against them.   Wildlife enjoy their life of freedom and it is possible for your spirit to be put into wildlife as a form of heaven for those who appreciate living free with nature.  Others may be required to live in animals minds that you harm to evolve your spirit to respect life more.  Many wild animals eat poisonous plants including agricultural plants with herbicides and pesticides, and have viruses that can contaminate your home so eating wild animals can cause you to have toxins and little known diseases that can cause shorter life spans.  Many small animals that rarely cause a problem to humanity or habitat should be protected like songbirds and never be hunted or killed by humanity. Natural predators other than humans should be allowed to affect them.  The wildlife covenant with God is to accept  a merciful ! move or possible death by God or humanity, when their numbers become too many and causing  significant harm to humanity or habitat, rather than a slower death by predators.    God tries to preserve their soul,  grant them land to live, and give their spirits good safe heavens such as in the minds of comfortable humans, other animals, land, trees, or sky.  What humans do to other earthlings will affect what the God mind in any geographic area does to humanity.  Hunters each year go to the wildlife areas to commit massacres of tribes of earthlings and cause their spirits to legitimately war on humans.  They can cause all kinds of mental and physical illnesses due to the trouble that hunters cause.  If you think that hunters have a God given right to murder other earthlings without retribution, then you are seriously wrong.  You should show God that you are reverent to all that God has made such as birds, animals, trees, and plants.  God will respect you more and love you mor! e if you can help the Lord take care of the other creations of! life.

 The Bible, the New Testament, and the Koran speaks of phenomenon occurring when a tree is bothered.  The scriptures suggest voices and wrath could occur when trees are harmed.  The spirits of the ""Moon of Memphis"" suggest that since there is much electricity in a tree, it is possible for trees to think, dream or possess a form of consciousness recognized by God.  Trees may be a plant animal so be careful when harming a tree.  If it has nerves then winter is the season to prune them so they will not feel pain and curse you.  Cutting a tree at night may cause less pain since their consciousness are possibly stimulated by sunlight.  If you must cut wood then use the wood in a structure so the weight of the wood can reorganize into a acceptable consciousness and thus you will be cursed less.  Pray for your trees and pray about cutting them and if you feel it is wrong then don't cut them or harm them.  Show reverence to trees and save yourselves.

 The parents who have children must apply kindness and justice to their discipline of children.  Never beat, hit or  whip a child just because they get on your nerves.  Harsh punishment and training should be reserved for the most malicious, cruel, or mean conduct. Evil conduct is dealt with more sternly than nerve troublesome conduct and honest mistakes should be dealt with a understanding, kind response. Do not be cruel to your children or you will be surely be cursed and many phenomenon of health could occur to you for cruelty.  Do not forget that as you want the Lord to forgive and give mercy to you, when a sorrowful child cries out for forgiveness and mercy, you represent the Lord and should not let your temper ignore your heart of kindness.

 The spirits of God, Christ, and Allah the ?Moon of Memphis? say that most rebellion and crime in most nations is the result of government failure to fulfill its role to its peoples. This can be discrimination against some segment of the population such as minorities or peoples with mental and physical disabilities.  In the more modern nations, minorities have rebelled and sued the government for equal rights and opportunities. Presently in most of the countries of the world the disabled have difficulty getting help in a timely manner. Disabled people, those with low learning abilities and mental disorders plus those with physical disabilities have been forced to suffer or forced to engage the sale of drugs and prostitution to sustain themselves to survive when the neglected by government and uncaring majorities. Government has a duty to provide the disable with a healthy pension or job so they can live a normal life and live a peaceful life free of crime and rebellion. The i! mprisonment of the disabled in most world countries by naive and uncaring governments constitutes a gross civil rights abuse and cruelty. It is a violation against the duties of government and God to neglect and abuse the disabled and those who continues to ignore the disabled and abused them will be cursed by God and they will suffer mental and physical illnesses and bad luck from the spirits of God, Christ, or Allah.

 In your memory of people you know, your mind makes spirits patterned after them. Sometime these spirits are loyal to the person they are patterned after. If you talk bad about a person then that person's spirit sometimes work against you by giving you bad subconscious advice and emotions and may be able to affect your mental and physical health. If you behave poorly, they may turn against you because you have lost their respect and love. If you keep bad friends then these poor or bad spirits may behave like your friends, saying things in your mind subconsciously to cause you to make poor decisions and make trouble for other people. You must not gossip or talk bad about others, especially against those you know closely and you must not get to know bad character individuals if you are weak in moral or law abiding behaviors. From watching television, you can even create spirits of people in the media or government. These spirits represent society and if you don't act right, the! y too can turn against you and make you ill. Everyone's mind makes spirits but most of the spirits influence the subconscious mind. Some people are disabled because they hear these same spirits in their conscious mind and sometimes they learn how to make changes in their lives and get along with them. Spirits are a fact of life but the Spirits of God are made from the ""Moon of Memphis"", the Earth, and from spirits that are especially good and kind; often influenced by religious texts of kind religions.  The spirits of Earth and sky can communicate with the spirits of your mind to influence your mind and body for various reasons and can create structured realities to affect you in usual positive ways but occasionally to bring you bad luck for something you have intentionally or accidentally harmed on this Earth.

  The spirits of the land, trees, animals, humans, and sky can collect in the sky and make a glowing UFO that can be many acres in size and create light. Like phenomenon of dreams created from smaller size spirit matter in the brains of animals, in the UFOs, they can hover in space above a city or country and produce radio that is of good quality and very similar to human made radio. This is why some of the music and radio messages seem to be talking to what is on your mind because the spirits inside your head receive the signals also and guide your thoughts. These thoughts are designed to make you kinder, understanding of others, and forgiving to make you better and help you overcome negative thoughts planted from less honorable information given to you by other humans or human spirits and media sometimes behaving as the devil or Satan who may want you to be prejudice against others or act in a way that could cause you to harm others or become harmed. Listen for the kind thou! ghts and kind messages from God's UFO radio in words or music and receive security and wisdom from God.  This information is derived from analyzing the ""Moon of Memphis"" UFO phenomenon and radio phenomenon associated with God's spirits and voice phenomenon. Since the UFO produces light, there is no logical reason that would prevent it from producing radio and my personal experience strongly suggest that this capability exist.

  The God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" would like the youth and adults to focus on character traits to improve themselves as citizens of this world.  The international scouting organization have focused on twelve traits and have lead this living witness to learn and live by them.  They are trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.  Your religious leaders, parents, community leaders and teachers may have other good character traits that you should also focus on to improve yourselves and be a honorable citizen of your community and God.

 As Will-i-am of God,  a son of forests, fields, deserts, tundra, waters, land, sky, and cities,  I have asked the good Spirits of God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" to save the people of this world with good character and kindness to all earthlings.  They include the animals of Nature, food animals, trees, objects, structures, land, waters, sky, humans, spirits, God, and other forms of life.  These Spirits of God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" said that they would save them and try to bless them.  They ask the saved to help other people to develop good character and kindness to all earthlings so they too may be saved by the God of all kind religions, the God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" that appeared in 1964 to this honest living witness.  The God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" chose a boy named William to appear to because his name means ""protector of the weak and innocent"" and God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" also tries to protect the weak and innocent. The good spirits of the ""Moon of Memphis"" hav! e the power to save.

 Jesus Christ is one of the good Spirits of God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" who also saves. In Matthew 5 of the New Testament of the Bible he says:   3aBlessed are the bpoor in spirit: for theirs is the ckingdom of heaven.

4Blessed are they that amourn: for they shall be bcomforted.

5Blessed are the ameek: for they shall inherit the bearth.

6Blessed are they which do ahunger and thirst after brighteousness: for they shall be filled.

7Blessed are the amerciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

8Blessed are the apure in bheart: for they shall csee God.

9Blessed are the apeacemakers: for they shall be called the bchildren of God.

10Blessed are they which are apersecuted for brighteousness? sake: for ctheirs is the kingdom of heaven.

   These verses show, for example,  some categories of people that the Spirit of Jesus of the ""Moon of Memphis""  saves regardless of their beliefs or religion as long as they have learned to be good and kind.  The Spirit of Jesus of the ""Moon of Memphis"" appreciates the groups and churches that teaches his ministry and lessons devoted to character and to God.

   God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" is not responsible for many natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornados, floods, droughts, and earthquakes. God is also not responsible for accidents and acts of violence but God can help you a little and maybe that will be enough to protect you most of the time.   You are loved by the Lord, our God, and God is dedicated to recreating many of the dead and injured by these disasters, accidents, and violence.  Do not be demoralized by them for the Lord cares about you and want you to not be harmed.  We may sense reasons for the disasters because there are many sinners in the communities but God prefers to work with sinners on an individual manner and chooses not to use disasters to harm a few individuals at the expense of the many.  God prefers and is limited sometimes to helping you by affecting your thinking so listen up to your conscious and subconscious mind for good advice to improve your safety and security. In addition, God of the ""Moon o! f Memphis"" uses its spirits to organize society to create schools, religion, industry, science, and government systems to improve society's behavior thus creating as many decent well behaved and helped citizens as possible to minimize suffering, dangers, and crime.

 The spirits of the ?Moon of Memphis? have moved me to comment on various topics. God wants you to pray to the Lord about your problems and hopefully, these comments will start you in that direction.

 God  please help the hungry. If you are hungry and suffer, God will take away your pain in time. Those that feed the hungry will be blessed for their kindness.  Do not do evil while you suffer and the Lord will recreate you in better times if you stay honorable and endure faithfully.

 God please bless the poor and improve their condition. If you are poor, do not do evil to sustain yourselves. God will try to improve your community if you live honorably and try to improve yourselves. If you die poor, God will try to remake you in more successful families so do not give up hope because this lifespan will one day end and you will get a new beginning.

 God please heal the mentally ill. The Lord knows that you are suffering and do not give up on life. It may take a while for the Lord to help you but he is searching for people like you. If you perish, God will give you a new mind in your next life on this earth.

 God please heal the physically ill. God will try to heal you with doctors and religious people. You may try to prepare yourself for you disability or death by being kind in every way imaginable. End the conflicts in your life and mind and know that you will one day inherit a new body and spirit.

 God please help the lonely.  May your God open your mind and speak to you.  Avoid finding fault in others and be helpful to others and you will find friendship and love.  Do not give up your life to evil and harmful conduct and the Lord will bless you and you will not be lonely for a long time.  Try to improve your heart and character so others will like you better.

 God please help the desperate men and women.   May you find each other to help each other with love and gifts of love to sustain you.  If you cannot find work then with your consciousness and God as your guide, try helping each other without being cruel and heartless. Be honest and honorable to those who befriend you to help you.  Do not have contempt in your hearts to others and they will sense your kindness and will help you with your needs.

 God please bless the elderly and widows.  You are special people weakened by age and the loss of your love ones and friends.  Those that help you with friendship and love will also be blessed with God's friendship and love.  Make peace with your family and receive their considerate love and care.  God will one day welcome you to new dimensions of life so you must prepare by being full of grace and kindness.

 God please stop the evil sinners. If you are a evil sinner then your fate cannot improve unless you immediately repent and follow a better behaved spirit. You will have much bad luck until you change to a kind decent individual. You cannot have peace in your mind until you change. If you are captured and imprisoned, then know that the Lord will work with you to help your bear your punishment honorably. If you must die for your sins and crimes, the Lord will try to help you live again in better circumstances so that honorable life will be easier to live.

 God please help me to deal with enemies.  To love your enemy you must try to understand their culture, mind, and perspectives. From this understanding you can try to reconcile your differences with them. Examine yourself to see whether or not you are a good being or people. Correct your own culture, mind, and perspectives before acting against others or for God. War with your enemy only to defend yourselves and help God to stop their evil against yourself and others. If your enemy is generally good, kind, and honorable then lend yourself to their influence and love your enemy.

 God please bless the dead. Do not grieve excessively for the dead for they are in God hands and they will be dealt with in a fair manner. The weak will be strengthened and the righteous will be rewarded. Others will be remade on this earth in better times and conditions. Rejoice to the wisdom and fairness of God.

 God thank you for the blessed. If your life is good then try to be an honorable example of kindness. Your luck is intentional so you can carry the spirits of the less fortunate in your minds. Many lives have hoped to live in the minds of the blessed so enjoy your life and remember others that you share reality with. Charity and kindness should be your passion.

 The spirits of the ?Moon of Memphis? stated that billions Messiahs will be born on the earth. Some have already been born and are now youth and adults. These Messiahs will be from all the nations, all kind religions, atheists, most animals, and spirits. They will have much character and kindness to all earthlings.  They will be both male and female and they will be Holy.  These Messiahs will be of religion, science, industry, government, military, parenting, business, medicine, entertainment, land management, food production, judiciary, construction, charity, and many other fields and occupations.  Look for these Messiahs for the Lord has returned to the Earth to rule and assist this world. You will know the Lord by many names but the fulfillment of prophecy will occur. This world was visited in 1964 with the ?Moon of Memphis? a sign of the spirits of God, messiahs, and prophets. They do have the Christ or Messiah mind that they radio into the minds of the good and kind of t! his earth. The Holy light will be visible by those who are fortunate and the kind spirit will be heard by those who are blessed; and they will be living witnesses of the return and presence of the Lord, our God.

 The Revelation from the Christ of the ?Moon of Memphis? explains how we will live again on this earth. We never die on this God blessed planet because it has life and it has a soul. The soul is everything outside the body that influences the brain to recreate the mind of a human. That is geography, language, history, religion, culture and species. These external factors create the mind and consciousness and will recreate you after you die. You pop out of life when you die and you reenter life by the ""conscious creating soul"" within a short period of time. You will probably have amnesia of your past life but you will certainly have consciousness again. If you made the world better and safer in your past life then you will come alive again in a world that you help create.

 When God is at rest or allowing the natural world to recreate you then you have the phenomenon that was mentioned in the previous paragraph. God can collect your spirit by setting off a radio in your brain when activated by signals from the ""Moon of Memphis"". This would probably occur day or night when the ""Moon of Memphis"" is high in the sky or space above. When hovering it would be hard to tell whether it's the moon at low altitude or a star at high altitude.

 When God wants you to be held accountable for your actions or if God wants to give special consideration to your spirit for it's accomplishments then you may experience unique mind phenomenon. Your spirit collected can allow God to do things to you in your afterlife. Heaven and Hell are two places that your spirit can go. It is possible for God to put your spirit in other people or in animals to help you understand them and their plight. If you are insensitive to others then God may recreate you in beings that you care little about. It's God's justice and you sometimes must evolve through those you don't care about. These might be animals that you harm or people that you cannot understand or help.  If you are a good influence then your spirit may be able to enter the minds of those you prefer.  Worship God, Christ, and the power of the ""Moon of Memphis"" and may God bless and have mercy on your spirit and soul.

 Because animals have the goodness and kindness of nature, they should be never be harmed.  They have a lifestyle that humanity needs to respect and understand.  They must be allowed to roam the land without being molested or murdered.  God places the spirits of humanity often into animals as a heaven that some want or deserves.  If you grant the animals peace then your heaven will have peace but if you violate the heaven for animals by molesting their habitat and murdering them for fun and recreation then you will have to answer to God.   A good and kind heaven requires humanity to respect nature, the lands of nature, and the animals of nature, for the trees will be the pillars of your church called nature and in the minds of animals you will return to the garden of Eden, one type of heaven.

 The UFO phenomenon may be the result of a natural intelligent life form that scientist have yet to understand and explain. I will offer one theory of how the UFO is formed and why they are of an intelligent life form associated to God.

 I believe that there is a structured electro magnetic nuclear form that exist in space that absorbs light energy and it is a stable form made from light photons that no longer travel and other energy that no longer travel or move. It has a fabric or form that enables it to organize as a brain and store memory and information. It is an energy or spirit life form that collects and grows from light and energy. Over time, matter starts forming within it so it basically helps energy to reform into matter. It probably starts out is life span as a marble size intelligent life and grows into much larger size and eventually becomes meteors, comets, moons, planets, and stars. During it smaller youth size, it can enter there atmosphere and also enter to objects such as land, plants, animals, and clouds. Its can give consciousness to anything that it enters and in humans, it can cause people to hear voices of spirits and produce dreams. In trees, land, and clouds it also can produce int! elligence and phenomenon that is often associated with God.

 These wisps of spirit energy beings can learn and affect other life in good or bad ways. These energy matter beings can also be religious or atheist in their outlook of themselves and humanity. They can come together, form large bodies of spirit energy matter beings, and form into impressive UFOs and start to glow from these collectives of spirit energy matter beings. Since they are intelligent, their collective can be organized into large multi-acre starships usually round in nature that can travel in the atmosphere or space. If they want to they can travel to other stars and disassemble and influence the mind of a planet and act as the God spirits to the life there. They could just find a star and grow to such a size to precipitate star energy into matter and form a planet. Other collectives can also in coordination with other collectives form into moons for the planet. This is how the spirit energy matter beings can influence reality and act as a conscious God to form pla! nets and UFOs.

 If your mind has this type of spirit energy matter being in it, you probably are influencing it to create a spirit within it patterned after your consciousness and personality. If you die this being will probably leave your brain and carry your spirit to another location. It might take your spirit to a collective called heaven or maybe into a UFO or even choose to enter the brain of another person, animal, or other objects such as land, trees, or clouds. Great opportunities exist for those who are lucky enough to have one of these energy matter spirit beings in your brain.

  If you want to signal the ""Moon of Memphis"", then put color lights on your front and back porch and color lights in your windows and light it every night for months and years. This will get God's attention as you stand out in the night and you will probably notice more dream activity. I have displayed color lights at my house for several years and it really works. This will help you get your spirit collected without harming the flesh and provide more peace and security to your mind as your lights call out to God for attention, love, and help.

  Messenger of God of the ""Moon of Memphis"" William H. Bickers Capt USAF O-3 / Lt USCG O-3 Retired  PS:  People will believe what they want to believe but this article is both true and honest.  Much of the contents of this article has been published by these internet newspapers :  Memphis FM; Tennessee Post; West Virginia Post; Alabama Post; Arkansas Post; Washington State Post;  White House News; Security Council News; Pentagon Post; Israel Post; Israel FM; Saudi Times; Gaza News; Palestine Post; Iran Republic; Vatican Post; Muslim Generation; NASA News; World Wide News; Slavic Times; and many more.  I hope you received a blessing from reading this article.

 Notes about author: I have worshiped in many churches such as Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, Episcopal, Pentecostal, Assembly of God, Anglican, Catholic, Presbyterian, Church of Christ, Church of God, Military, TV and Mormon churches.  I believe that worshiping with others help you overcome prejudices and become one with the body of believers.  I also believe that every kind religion is another testament of God and much can be also learned of God by studying other religions.

 I have visited some other countries and lands over my life.  The places that I visited are:  United States, Canada, Mexico, England, Scotland, Spain, Guam, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the Bahamas.  I learned that we are very much alike all over the world.   Please show this article to your friends, family, and religious leaders if you could be so kind.  Everyone deserves to know about the ""Moon of Memphis"", the appearance of the Messiah.

 Other evidence of a God both outside of my mind and inside of my mind is a piece of land that I bought at age 19 which just happen to be 6.4 acres of land that I bought to give back to God by allowing it to go wild.  It is my little Israel or Zion on the floodplain of the Loosahatchie River bottoms near Firestone city park of Memphis in Frayser.  This river is 64 miles long by the way which may be another reason the  1964 ""Moon of Memphis"" appeared within a mile of that river.   Another instance was when I had to find a house to rent I was not very conscious of its number significance until years later when I wrote this article.  My address was on a street in Frayser neighborhood of Memphis called Adair Street.  ""Adair"" has a numeric sum of 33 thirty three and the block was also 33 thirty three.  My initials equals 33 and I started to hear voices of spirits at age 33.  These two examples show evidence of a God in the community working structured realities with the cooperatio! n with the spirit of God inside my head.","USCG Retired",1,1,"circle",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1964,1960,4,11,22,"Night","South",1,0,1,1,0

I was at the top of a hill that you could see the whole bay from and I looked to my side a little and I saw these two really bright, big lights staying still and equidistant in the sky.  They were larger than stars, light yellow, and they were not blinking and just as my boyfriend made a joke about it being a UFO, a third, even brighter one appeared--and by ""appeared,""  I mean it was just all of a sudden there--over those two and made a perfect triangle.  

And they stayed like that, perfectly still, for about two or three minutes before they began to spin and rotate kinda slowly.  I think they were maintaining their perfect triangle shape but the shape seemed to morph as it spun in the sky. 

And then one of them shot off to the right and disappeared and it was just two that were sort of orbiting each other.  They stayed like that for a while and then another floated over and took its place and it continued like this for like 15 minutes until they all floated away from one another and eventually faded away. 

We decided to keep walking while keeping our eyes on it but we eventually lost sight.  Then a couple minutes later we saw the same thing a few miles over.  As we were walking further down the road we saw the same thing again even further over, again.  

We never saw two of these formations at once so we can't say how many there actually were, but we did see a formation in various, distinctly different spots within a very short amount of time.  We then decided to go get some food.   We were in there for about half an hour to forty-five minutes and when we came out, we saw another two-light formation over the parking lot.  

We watched it for about a minute before going to the other side of the plaza, which obscured our view. The store we were meaning to go to was closed, though, so we headed back around.  

By the time we got back, the lights had completely vanished. It only took about a minute and a half. The last formation we saw was another two! -lighter over the bay before we went in the house.

 The lights did not blink like most aircraft; sometimes they did not even move--just hovered, stationary, above the city in a perfect triangle. There seemed to always be a main ""tip"" of the triangle that the whole formation rotated around.

I watched the two lights thinking at first they were helicopters but noticed there was no sound and they were flying almost around each other. One of them faded out and the leading one kept moving.

We saw a huge what I would describe as a building in the sky that was rounded but tall, several stories high with many lights/windows.  Besides me and my family seeing this, the girl working the drive through window also looked out and saw it, it was not like anything I have ever even heard of and have not seen anything else online about UFOs that look like flying buildings but it was unmistakable. Ellenville is around 12 miles from Pine Bush where there are many UFO sightings and also where I would have my second sighting of a UFO around 2001 or so that was more up close and I will post the story online here separately.

Between 7:50 pm and 8:10 pm on the night of Feb 1st 2012, I witnessed UFO in Austin, TX.

Physical appearance:  A bright green fireball with a long bright green tail.    The fireball was much bigger than any star but smaller than the moon.  The tail was almost as bright ? and just as green ? as the fireball.  There was no trail.

Length of time:  I witnessed it for five or ten seconds.  Long enough to realize it wasn?t a flare or fireworks because it never dissipated.  Eventually, it went beyond the horizon (tall trees about a block away).  I did not see it decrease in brightness.

Trajectory:  I was facing north.  The fireball was heading northeast.  It seemed to be moving downward at a small angle, from my perspective about 25 degrees.  It appeared to be moving away from me, so it?s hard to tell if it was actually falling towards the earth.  Basically, I saw it move across the northern sky until it disappeared beyond the treetops.

Location:  I was at an outdoor seating area of a food trailer park on the 2200 block of East Cesar Chavez Street in Austin, TX.  About a mile and a half east of downtown and about four miles northwest of the airport.

About a minute after I witnessed this, a low-flying helicopter zoomed overhead, from the direction of the airport, going in the exact direction I witnessed the fireball.  This might be a coincidence because I was relatively close to the airport.  I?m confident of the time because I was on the phone when I saw it, and the time given above is from the call history.  There were about eight other people eating in this area, (along with some kitchen workers in the various food trailers) and two performing musicians.  Nobody else saw the fireball as they were all watching the musicians or working.

We were driving north on Monterey Road.  Lots of businesses.. streetlights but this caught our eye.  To the left (west) we saw a very bright light floating in the sky.  It hovered like it was not moving at all.  It was bigger and brighter than the closest star.. it alwmost appeared to be glowing.  

We attempted to photograph it with our cell phones but it would not appear in their view finders, however, we managed to videotape it for about 20 seconds when suddenly, it  sped towards us at an extremely alarming speed.  We gestimated that it was originally about 100 miles from us, however , in less than half a second, it was about  50-60 miles closer to us.. just like that.  

We pulled over to watch it as it appeared to suddenly move faster and it apeared to change colors.. the hue would flash a faint green or purple.

After stopping to eat to pick up food and go home, we checked outside our door a few tiems.. it still seemed to hover but was further away,, say 100-200 miles at that point.. like a pin drop in the sky.  We all agreed that this was no plane, no helicopter, nothing we had ever seen nor experienced before.

FYI:  Right before we saw this objest, my car stopped for no apparent reason, just stopped while I was driving. We parked, went into our friends house.. she stated that her friend had left late because her car battery had died and she needed a new one.

A year and a half ago I was leaving my gf's house around 10pm to go get some fast food.  When I stepped outside I saw some lights off the in the distance and it was dark so they were easy to spot.  At first they were kinda far away so after 30 seconds or so I realized I was looking at 7 fireball spheres of plasma energy in single file formation spaced 1 after another spaced about 100-200 ft apart from one another.  They were about 6 ft in diameter going a slow 15-20 mph just floating over my head not more than 500 ft off the ground in a crowded residential area with a shopping mall just a few miles away. They looked like miniature suns, u could see inside it and realize there was no machinery whatsoever. It was all swirling fiery plasma, like a liquid lava lamp but being powered by a nuclear furnace.

When I realized what I was witnessing, I knew I had no camera so the next best thing would be witnesses so I ran back inside and my gfs mom was watching survivor and I told her she had to come see this so she goes out and cant believe her eyes so my gf is all the way inside and up in her bedroom so I have to run up and tell her theres ufos outside u gotta hurry if ure going to see them.  When she made it outside she got to see the last 3 or 4 floating off. I have been a huge believer in ufos before my sighting but my gfs mother is a catholic who doesnt like science fiction at all.  She would be the least likely person ever to believe in et's but she does now.  There is a local tv stations antennae just north of us in the direction the orbs were going.

This event occurred in south Oakland, near Bates & McKee Place, in Pittsburgh, PA.

At about 11pm, on October 16, 1992, just after I reached up to turn off the lamp above my bed, my room was filled with dazzling yellow light, as bright as daylight.  Thinking a transformer had blown on the power lines on the next street, I got up to look out the window.  The light coming in between the curtains was warm to my skin, like sunlight.  The source of the light seemed to be very close to the window.  I, then, wondered if someone were on the roof of the neighboring warehouse, shining some sort of light around the roof.  Earlier in the day, I the dirigible had made a chugging sound, and this light source made no sound.

When I opened my curtains, I saw a small, round, Oreo cookie-shaped vehicle, with a domed top and bottom.  In the center layer were small round lights on the outer ring of the craft.  The lights were amber in color.  From the bottom, emitted the singular, enormous light beam I had seen coming through my window.  The craft was about twelve to fifteen feet above my window and seemed to be about three and a half feet in diameter.  It was slowly ascending from the roof of the adjacent warehouse.

By now, the light beam was no longer pointed towards my window, but had swung away from it, shining along the wall to the back garden and the adjacent warehouse that made an L-shaped wall around the garden.  It shone on the garden for a brief moment, then, swung back so that it was perpendicular to the craft.  Then, it retracted into the craft and the entire vehicle disappeared.  It had not made a sound.

I woke my next door neighbor who reported seeing two beams of light coming through his window earlier, maybe 30 minutes before my experience.  He said that one beam had been blue and the other had been amber.  His windows faced the warehouse wall below where I saw the craft. He had been too tired to get out of bed to investigate.

At this point, it was midnight and I could not account for an entire hour of my time.

We went outside to see if we could see the lights or anything unusual, but we saw nothing.  No one on the street seemed to be looking surprized or paying any attention to the building where we had seen the light.  My neighbor climbed on the roof of the warehouse to see if there was evidence of something having been there, but he found nothing.

The next day, the elderly woman who lived in the apartment directly above mine reported being frightened by the bright light shining in her window the night before.  She did not open the curtains to directly observe the light.  She had lived in the building for 40+ years and was terrified of this light that night, deciding, ""It was a sign from God!""   Also, prior to seeing the light, my apartment had smelled strange, as if something hot and metallic were burning a bit.  I even checked my oven to see if the smell emitted from there, but it did not.  The other peculiar thing is that an electric alarm clock kept buzzing--not with the alarm sound, but with an electrical hum--in the hours directly preceding my sighting of this craft.  This clock was on a bureau beside the window from which I had seen the craft.

Ten months prior to this experience, in mid-January 1992, a bright light had awoken me around 2am. (My room was normally very dark, sheltered from outside street lights.)   My boyfriend was staring at the light, but did not respond when I asked him what it was.  In this instance, I did not get up and investigate.  I was too frightened to get out of bed.  The light lasted a moment or two and went out. The next morning, my boyfriend did not recall seeing any light in the middle of the night.

I think that this was the same craft perhaps visiting on two separate occasions.  The warehouse on which it was located stores food for a large local restaurant, but particularly houses many whole potatoes that are cut up to make a popular item at the restaurant.  My building and the warehouse were owned by the same person.  I did verify with the building maintenance personnel that no one had been on the warehouse roof with a light.  They all said that they had not been up there and that no light of that candle power was on the property, nor any other thing that could have looked like what was seen.","university affiliate faculty in education & research methods",3,1,"disk",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1992,1990,4,10,23,"Night","Northeast",1,0,0,1,0

Jrod (the nickname of my partner) and I were coming out of the local Home Depot, after purchasing some dry core sub flooring for his basement.  We decided to grab a slice of pie and a soda pop at the food stand stationed outside in the parking lot.  After grabbing our little mid evening snack, we proceeded to walk back to the truck to head back to the job site.  As we were walking towards my truck, Jrod noticed a strange craft in the sky northwest of us. 

At first, I was convinced that the craft was a chopper, but soon realized that its movements were too ""smooth"" and that it was the shape of a triangle.   At this point, Jrod became a bit frightened and wanted to go. I, on the other hand, was completely fascinated and took a few more moments to study the strange craft. It was NOT moving at a high velocity and was moving in a very ""smooth"" motion. There was no noticeable sound and it seemed to act as though it was searching for something.  The only other relevant in! formation I can provided is that Sikorsky Aircraft is only located 10 miles away. Maybe this craft was one of there toys........I just don't know since I have no education in the subject of Ufology.

 Whatever this craft was, it definitely made a mark on me. Jrod will not talk about what we saw so I have nowhere else to go to speak about this incident. I don't want to tell other people in my life for fear of being labeled, excuse my french, a ""wack ass"".

July 30th 2011 at 9:50 PM  On July 30th my girlfriend and I were driving to go grab some food when my girlfriend pointed out these strange balls of light hovering in front of the car.  My first reaction was that they were fireworks because of how they looked.  However, we realized very quickly that none of these objects were moving.   They were completely stationary.

At this point our view was blocked by buildings so I pulled the car around the block to try and see if we could get another glimpse.  We were able to pull behind a vacant building with an adjacent field and parked.

At this point the lights had seemed to move more into the distance.  My guess is somewhere over Brentwood anywhere from Brentwood High School or the WSM Tower.

Also the number of lights had grown to around 50.  These lights did move this time but in almost figure eight motions, some even seemed to come together.   They started from around tree height up to cloud level which the clouds were low because of a thunderstorm earlier.

My girlfriend was able to get picture and video of this event.  Also, while we were there about 20 other people came to view this as well.

After about 15 minutes the lights in no particular order very quickly disappeared.  Some seemed to do a quick flash before they would disappear.  It was maybe 30-45 seconds before they were gone once they started.

At this point my girlfriend and I got in my car to try to ride over to where we thought the lights were over.  To do this we had to go over a large hill.  Once over the hill at a red light we witnessed what I would guess was a Black Hawk helicopter just hovering right above the tree line pointing in the direction of the lights.  There were no lights on the helicopter; it reminded me of being blacked out for military operations.

We drove for another hour or so but never saw the lights again.","Fiber Optics",2,30,"fireball",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2011,2010,3,7,22,"Night","South",1,0,0,0,0

At about 9:30 pm, My family and I were on our way home after dinner at Tibby's in Winter Park.  We had gone to Winter Park to shop at the Whole Foods supermarket there. Right after passing the intersection of Lake Underhill and Econlockhatchee Road, travelling South on Econlockhatchee Rd., heading to home in Orlando, Florida , we saw a car in front of us pulled ooff the road on the right with its lights still on, door open and 2 young men outside the car. I was looking to see what they had pulled off for, and as we passed I saw that one person had either a camera or phone pointed up at about a 45-50 degree angle in front of him. It was odd because it was dark and all that was in front of him at that angle would be either a fence, a house's rooftop or the sky. So I was ""rubbernecking"", then some lights caught my attention in the dark sky, in the direction where he was pointing his camera/phone at (West of us). I saw a line of a number of glowing reddish orange glowing orbs, lighter and bright at the center, lined up in an arc formation moving from left to right and up, in the sky. I shouted out to my family to look, look, look, a line of strange reddish lights. I realized why the people had pulled off and what they must have been taking pictures of. My husband who was driving, also saw the lights I was shouting about and pulled off the road too. We were now ahead of the other car, with their headlights facing us. My husband and I got out of the car and watched, calling our daughter to come look. She did, but seemed scared and hesitant. None of us recognized what they could be, orb shaped, with that reddish orange glow, brighter and lighter in the center. It was obvious to us that they were not planes from how they looked, moved, lined up and disappeared. There was also a plane flying in the opposite direction toward them off to the right, likely intending to land at the airport in that general area.. They were moving up and rig! ht and were disappearing one by one as they moved to the far r! ight. Th e largest was about the size of a pea the distance. My daughter couldnt get her iphone camera to work properly as she frantically tried to get a shot, she says it froze but managed to get a picture, though thee photo looks very red in color.   The lowest one was largest and as they moved up to the right they were either smaller or farther, then disappeared one at a time. There were about 3 lower down and 2 up to the right. I don ' t know if there were more or not before we saw them since they were fisappearing. The people in the orher car had left. I only indicated 3 who saw this, counting only my family though I know at least 2 other strangers saw it as well. I wondered if the people in the plane did also. Eventually all disappeared. We went home, somewhat in shock and a little scared.

I looked up and saw a round white orb floating/hovering in the sky over Mt.Rubidoux...just a little to the right of a small dead tree on the side of the mountain. To be honest, I was just planning to look at the mountain as I have a thing for mountains. I looked at the orb like floating object for a moment and finally told my friend to look up as the object appeared to just be hovering.  After about 20 seconds, I decided to pull out my Kodak Play Sport Camera...that I always carry with me as I love to take pictures of my surroundings.  I started filming; however, I did not have my glasses on and could not see anything through my view finder, thus I only took a 19 second video clip from this vantage point.  The friend I was with suggested, I take still photos rather than video (which can be heard on the video) and then look at them when I get home to se! e what the object is by zooming in on the object if I actually got it in the picture frame.

At first, I thought...maybe it is a star...but I love looking into the sky at daytime and night time, yet I have never seen a star in this location at this time during the day. Due to the brightness, maybe it could be a meteor...but this had no tail, nor did it appear to be moving. Then the idea of a plane was in my mind...but again...this object was hovering...it was not flying in any direction when I first started my observation.  Eventually, I thought it could be a balloon...but again...the object just hovered....it did not move up or down nor did it move side to side...it was stationary for at least 10 minutes before it began to very slowly move in a northward direction. I then thought...maybe it is a weather balloon...but again...it did not move and it appeared to be too low for this type of activity. Additionally, the object was too high to be a hot air balloon. The object itself over the 40 minute time frame appeared to be round but could change from triangle, square o! r diamond shape.

Now over the next 40 minutes, my friend and I walked from Mt. Rubidoux ?to the Carlson Bark Park and across the bridge to a fast food place (Baker's) on Mission Blvd.  After exiting Baker?s we walked up to Limonite.  During that walk, I took 12 still pictures from different locations and 2 separate videos...one being 19 seconds long and the other being 39 seconds long.  I personally would have watched this object even longer and taken more photos and videos if my friend was not wanting so much to get home before the heat became unbearable...after all, we were on a 6 mile walk.  Yet in the time we did look at this object, it did eventually move northward very slowly...in fact, we went into Baker's and when exiting about 10 minutes later, we could still see the orb nearing the mountains near Ontario or Fontana.

Also, during our viewing, I saw at least 2 airliner (jets) fly by...so commercial jets did have an opportunity to witness this object as well.  As far as making any noise...neither of us heard anything.  Eventually, I lost sight of the orb once I got to Limonite and the sun was in my eyes...making it too difficult to see at this point.  However, I do have to say, when I got home and looked at my photos something interesting appears. Remember, at the time, I saw only one object...and that is also noted in the first 19 second video; however, in my first still picture...there is a second object off to the right and when zoomed in you can see a very solid object and yet when I took my second still picture...the second object is gone. We are talking literally seconds from picture to picture and I did not see or hear anything at the time. Yet for this object to be missing in the video and then in the first picture but not in the second picture it had to be traveling so fast that we j! ust could not have seen it.

That is it. So yes, I do have pictures and videos from different locations and I used trees, telephone poles, light poles and the mountain as reference points...so it can be verified by qualified researchers. I also did not erase them from my camera, so if real scientist would like to observe it and get the data and meta data from the original pictures and video they have that to reference as well.  I would send in the pictures and videos but I only want them studied and verified by qualified professionals at this time until I can get proper copyrights on the video and photos.

I was parked at a fast food location in the city of Antelope, California.  At around 7:00-7:15 p.m. I got out of my car and looked to the West of my location.  I was shocked to see a bluish spiral in the sky which appeared to look like a coil with one side being a very tight circle and slowly expanding to a very large circle.

This spiral appeared to be rotating and was only a few hundred feet above the tree line.  I then noticed that a small white orb was floating into the large circle side of this spiral and as soon as the orb entered the spiral, the entire thing seemed to close in on itself like an accordion and then it all vanished.  I found this amazing due to the fact that this location was less than a mile north of an old military base called McClennan Air Force base.  I had no idea what I saw but in the time after I feel my entire life shifted.

The entire thing only lasted two minutes and nobody around me seemed to notice.  I wanted to get a picture, but I was frozen and could not take my eyes off of this event.  It was oddly mesmerizing.

The year was 1973 in the winter (January or February), I was standing in my back yard in Roanoke Virginia.  As I was standing there in the dark Friday night about 9:00pm, something moving caught my attention in the sky.  It was a flying object about the volume of three 50-foot boxcars or the average fast food restaurant.  The shape was that of a sphere and the approximated dimensions of an M&M (without peanuts) and was a ""brushed"" silver finish.  There were no wings nor rudder or any kind of protrusions along the crafts? smooth lines.

The object was traveling from south to north (approximately) and I was curious, as this direction would lead it towards a close encounter with our airport so certainly they would see it on radar.  I viewed the sphere from about a 45 degree angle.  This object was flying at approximately 250 to 300 feet in altitude and was travelling about 100 miles an hour.

There was a rushing sound like the sound an automobile makes when it whizzes past very fast but no mechanical sounds were detected.  In addition, there were no lights whatsoever, there were the red and yellow reflections bouncing off its lower surface from our local nearby Burger King.

I summarized that this craft was under its own power, under some kind of intelligent control, has a purpose and if made by mankind it is far beyond any propulsion type and aerodynamic configuration that is publicly known about.  It was beyond any doubt an Unidentified Flying Object.

I am now 56 and then I was 17 soon to be 18, a aircraft model builder and being raised in the post WW2 environment was an avid young researcher in aircraft of all kinds so I was and still am ?up-to ?date? with most designs as well as with the experimental aircraft both commercial and military.  I still build models and am a far better researcher with perhaps more interest in the unknown than is healthy.

So it has been some 39 years ago and I am truly as baffled by my sighting today as I was the night that it happened!

It was about 9:30 pm when I was making a right turn on route 55 heading into town from Food Lion parking lot (Food Lion is a food store). I saw in my left view as I was making the turn a round object hovering low and flying at a low speed.  The object stopped in mud air and suddenly its entire button was lit up with bright light.  This happened while I was making the right turn. I do not know how many people saw it, but I assume it was seen by others as well as the area was relatively busy. I could not hear any noises from inside my car as all my can windows were up.  This was the first time in my whole life that I observed something like that. If our military has a technology like that, it would be really neat.  However, I doubt it that the object was man made, since it was flying with no lights on at night and suddunly stopped and put its bright lights on from the bottom of the object.  I could see any Colorado as it was dark.  Its lights were very white bright ! and all of them came out at once in a matter if a second.","College Professor",1,1,"disk",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2012,2010,2,6,21,"Evening","South",1,0,0,1,0

Worked at a fast-food restaurant and took the garbage out at the end of the night.  I sat on the curb and was looking around as it was a calm warm night, very pleasant.  I was looking up and saw a bright red light, stayed the same brightness, no flashing or pulsing.  It was moving at a great rate of speed moving from South to North.  It seemed very very high but was really bright.  It made no sound and although bright had no blurriness or coronas.  I thought it may have been the Space shuttle or ISS but being red seemed no right.  I stayed there for another while to see if any followed or if it came around again.  I just remember the speed being incredible as it seemed so far away.

My UFO encounter happened in South Jersey (""1956"") when I was in second grade.

It was dark outside, I was about 8 years old, we just started a late supper when dad said; ""What's that funny noise?"" Mom was standing next to the kitchen table dishing out food, we cut a look at each other in disbelief (cause dad's hearing was never good) how did he hear something we didn't?   Dad enthusiastically said; ""Come on, let's go outside. Let's see what it is. Not me, I was hungry & kept eating. 

Dad rushed back in the to get me, saying; ""come on, come on, come on, you don't want to miss this!""  Reluctantly, I got up (& for some unknown reason) turned directly around to note the exact time ... 8:32 PM on a school house clock. (Dad continued to coax me outside.)  

When I got outside dad was pointing to this dark spot in the night sky, it was terribly overcast with just a few stars here & there. Dad had put the yard light on (making it difficult to see) I couldn't make out a shape, just a darker spot in the sky.  He pointed saying; ""Look at the funny lights! See-em? See-em, right there."" I was looking but I didn't see any funny lights, just a very dark spot.

I decided to walk further away from the yard light. Mom & dad walked a few steps away too. I was about 25' to 30' further down the yard than them when I decided I was going to concentrate (with all my might) to make out a shape.

Boom, that was it, the next thing I knew, I was waking up. Mom & dad were asleep standing the yard with their mouths open, & that's when I realized my legs were aching like I ran a marathon. I looked in the direction they were looking but it wasn't were, it seemed to be further away, slightly higher, and left.

(All three of us were in slightly different positions than we were.)   I cleared my throat out loud and sheepishly said; ""Ah, dad ... dad?"" he woke up as my mom did a second later, they both put their heads down & walked directly in the house. I said; ""There it is right there! Look!"" they paid no attention.

The next thing I knew, that thing was much lower, easier to see, I walked under a tree, & closer to get a better view.

More than anything, I was extremely angry, I could now see the UFO with 5 of them staring at me. (About 150' away, it was no more that 25' off the ground at this point.) (They had rounder bald heads than the grays, the best I can tell, there was like a hazy fog around their ship.)  I remember thinking ... you lousy bastards, you mess with us, then sit there watching what we do? Thinking about that P.O.ed me even more!  I found a rock and threw it at them, I looked for another but only found a dirt clod so I threw that feeling I showed them how I felt about them. (Although they didn't physically react, I did get a minor feeling they were somewhat surprised I did that.) I turned then stomped in the house.

I heard dad walking up the stairs, while mom keep repeating; ""Would you look at the time? What happened to the time? Where'd the time go?"" (About 3 times over.) Don't know if I would have noticed if she hadn't pointed it out.

Shocked, it was now 9:40 (an hour & eight minutes later in time). Mom suddenly declared; ""I'm going to bed right now!"" With me still staring at the clock, & with a burst of determination she quickly went around behind me and shot upstairs. (???)  My mom, as long as I knew her Never Ever went to bed before 12. I was dumbfounded knowing that ... I had lots of questions, I tried processing the events but could not figure out how this happened, it made no sense.

(With no answers, I remember thinking, I'll have to figure it out later, and went to bed.)  The next morning food & dishes were still on the kitchen table, mom was having a fit, shoving a dish right in my face saying; ""Nobody finished supper, we left the food on the table all night, I cooked supper for nothing ... "" & etc.

I went to school that day, waiting until supper (to kind of re-create the moment) when I questioned them both. They completely ignored me at first, I mean I had one heck of a time getting their attention. I asked dad again & again; ""Dad, remember you said you heard those funny sounds last night?"" after 3 times he finally turned with the most blurry, blood shot, dead eyes, and said; ""Uh-huh."" I said; ""Dad, dad remember you saw those funny lights?"" I repeated it over & over until he turned to me again & said; ""Uh-huh.""  That's it?  I turned to my mom saying; Remember when you said; ""Look at the time? What happened to the time? Where'd the time go?"" I repeated it several times until she finally turned to me with bleary, welled up, blood shot eyes, and said; ""Uh-huh.""  Nothing! Ahhhhh!!!  Mom & dad started talking about something else, and me, I put my head down realizing they didn't remember anything, they were no help at all.

I thought, here's my father one of the most brilliant & talented people I know he was a pilot, an inventor, RCA copied the long range TV antenna after his model, he was smarter than any of my teachers. He had an amazing memory, quoted Shakespeare, could add a full shopping cart of groceries before the checker could finish punching in the prices, he had ESP & could read minds, telling me (word for word) what someone was going to say before they said a thing, he told me my future (things that were 40 years out) & yet, he didn't have chance against them, he can't remember anything, they're more powerful than he is.

I felt very alone & with no one to protect me from those rotten bastards.  I felt hopeless thinking ... what chance do I have?  In third grade, I was home (by myself) when I saw a UFO account on broadcast TV (it involved story after story about crashed military aircraft, including a passenger airliner that had supposedly been downed by UFO craft in the ""1950's"".

(I was amazed) it showed UFO's darting a crossed a clear blue sky, & told how the military had made a decision to not attempt to shoot at them because of too many lost lives & equipment losses.

After watching that film I was excited & asked just about everybody. I told my parents, believing I'd soon have answers & find the real truth ... sorry to say, that was it, no one I knew saw it, & nothing ever became of it. (I've looked on line to find that same broadcast ... but nothing except for a tiny segment you can see on a Disney broadcast.) ""Disney UFO Documentary: 'Alien Encounters'""  In sixth grade my class had the most wonderful teacher, Mrs. Mixner (we all loved her) one day she asked if anyone had seen a UFO. Feeling brave I raised my hand & told her & the class the whole story, it was the first time I opened up about what happened. Classmate, Mary Anne Catalano volunteered that she & her parents had seen a strange light in the sky (I was hoping for more) Mrs. Mixner asked her several questions, but she didn't remember anything else, that was it? (Ahhh ... !!!)  As teen, and as an adult, I would sometimes bring the subject up to dad ... he would just freeze up. I do remember a few times when he'd say; ""You know there are UFO's and E.T.s out there, anybody who believes we're the only species in this universe is stupid!"" I would always say, yes dad, I KNOW we're not the only ones.

Through the years I read whatever I could find on the subject, told my friends, coworkers, two wives, & my kids, but I never had anyone tell me of any experiences.

It always ends the same way, no one ever makes a comment after I tell my story.

One of the last times I talked to my dad (he called from Florida) he was especially up beat & cheerful telling me all the stuff he was doing, fishing, the green house he made, & so I decided to slip in our UFO incident.

Oh man ... I've felt horrible for doing that ever since. I waited. He didn't say Uh-huh that day ... it was just this very long pause (dad was always worried about the phone bill & with him not saying anything it was highly unusual) finally I asked if he was still there, he said; ""Yes."" I only talked to him one more time after that, I killed his spirit of joy, and that call ended abruptly. Dad died in ""1991""  I decided to move to Florida staying with my mom for a little while.  I told her the whole UFO story, carefully detailing every part, what everybody said, & what my thoughts were, just hoping she'd remember or say something helpful.

Mom didn't say a word during the story, she just listened. (I seriously doubted she would even respond after all those years of nothing.) Big surprise (as soon as I finished) mom immediately shocked me by going into a story about the time she was pregnant when I was little. She said; ""You probably don't remember this ... ""  I said; ""Oh yes do (I recounted) I remember the day dad asked if I wanted a little brother or a sister. I was standing by the grape arbor eating grapes when he came out and asked me, he had this bounce in his step, filled with joy, and as happy as I'd ever see him."" Then Mom said; ""You know, your dad could never figure it out what happened ... it just went away.""  Ohhhhh ... noooo, alarm bells went off with my knowing about that hybrid program the E.T. were doing, ahhhhh!  Could I have a 1/2 alien brother or sister out there ... ??? ... oh no!  Okay, occasionally a fetus can be absorbed back into the mother's body, but under the circumstances, considering the time line being so close to that same time (I have NO proof) but I do have some serious concerns as to what could have happened.

Mom died in 2005 and I must say I'm grateful for having had the opportunity to relate that story to her, and more than a little spooked to learn what she had to say in return.

On or about May 1, 2009, around 8:00 p.m. on a clear night, I was driving home from dinner with my sister and our girlfriend.  We live in a rural part of town with a few farms, and several neighborhoods. It is very peaceful and everyone practically knows each other.

Here is a recount of what I saw that night.  I was driving my SUV, my sister was in the passenger seat, and our girlfriend was in the back seat behind the passenger.  As I made a left hand turn onto my girlfriend?s street, my girlfriend and I noticed bright, white lights just above the treetops about 300 yards away.  My friend and I saw what looked like to be a ?horizontal shaped Ferris-wheel? type object in bright, white lights (several lights spaced apart but looked to be connected vertically) hovering just over the treetops at the end of an open field.  The object was not moving. The lights were spaced in two?s ? one on top, one on the bottom, perfectly aligned, perfectly distanced from one another ? they were several of them. The circular object was huge!  We were speechless.  When I finally had to put my eyes back onto the road, the two of us were hysterical.  We asked my sister what she thought about it, but she was looking straight ahead at the road.  She never saw th! e lights.  At first, we thought someone was having a party and had rented circus-type rides.  However, why would the rides be above the treetops?  We decided I should keep driving while we tried to locate the lights in the sky so my sister could see them.  I ended up driving a three-mile loop, but they were gone.  From the time she and I saw the lights to driving the three-mile loop, about 5 minutes had passed.  There was absolutely no sighting of anything in the sky, nor no sighting of any parties in the neighborhood.

As we dropped off our girlfriend, we told her father about what we saw.  I wanted to call the police department.  He told us we were crazy!  He asked us what we ate for dinner.  My girlfriend and I ate the chicken fingers with fries and he told us something was in the food.  I still cannot get that vision out of my mind.  I drive past that area all time, as it is about two miles from my home.

I was 44 years old and working at the family business.  My girlfriend was 38 years old and owned a hair salon.  My sister, also 38 years old, works at the family business.  Whenever we get together, we reminisce about that night and what we saw.  We both believe it was something extraterrestrial.

This isn?t the first time I noticed odd things in the sky.  I know it won?t be my last.

#5.   McDermitt, Nevada Glow.  In 1975 my folks and I were in the Lapidary trade (commercial rock-hounds) digging about 10 miles west of McDermitt, Nevada, on the Disaster Peak Road, which is heading due west from McDermitt, Nevada, on the way to the Trout Creek Mountains.  We had a pick-up camper set up off the pickup as living quarters.  I would go home to Sweet Home, Oregon every other week to see my boys. (My divorce had decreed I could get my two sons every other weekend.) On the week--ends between, I'd go shopping on Sunday in Winnemucca, Nevada, for what supplies and food we would use while mining at that location.  

For some reason my parents needed to go out for one of the week-ends and I stayed alone at the digging pit.  Our location was high on a desert plateau, almost always a wind, very dry, but the elevation seemed to negate the heat, so it wasn't an unpleasant spot.  In the evenings it was difficult to get a good radio signal and television was out of the question. I would usually listen to KBOI, an AM frequency from Boise, Idaho.  Many nights I'd fall asleep with the radio still playing and wake up to a bunch of stati cas it was not great reception on a constant basis.  Then I'd turn off the radio and go back to sleep.  

This particular evening I woke up to static.....no big deal, figured I'd forgot to turn the radio off as I would do quite often.  Surprise......when I went to turn the radio off, IT WAS OFF!   Okay, I figured I was still groggy from waking up.  I got out of bed, splashed my eyes with water just to be sure I wasn't having a dream.  At that time I noticed it was very light outside.  The amount of light outside seemed extra-ordinarily bright even if it was a full moon (which it was).  I opened the camper door, which faced to the west and noticed the full moon, okay, but also another glow coming from the small amount of clouds to the west. 

 However, this glow was larger than the moon, which I could see easily, and was a shimmering yellow, white, silver, pink and kept changing colors as I watched it.  My jaw must have been gaping in disbelief!  As I watched, it would slowly move west, then south, then north......not quickly, but always in motion. It would drif! t out of the clouds, then into the clouds.  It was brighter than the full moon and constantly changing colors. (Pastel colors, not vivid colors.)  To say I was scared would be a bit of an understatement.  I went back inside the camper and got dressed. In the excitement it didn't take long to dress!  

I continued to watch this object for over an hour. The noise that I had initially thought to be the radio was coming from this object. Not loud, but always present.  My best estimate of size would depend on the distance I thought it to be away from me. I estimate the object at 300-400 feet in diameter, and 5-8 miles away, maybe more.  I finally thought to look at the time.....4:10 A.M. So I must have awakened about 3:00 A.M.  It slowly drifted west over the Trout Creek Mountains out of view. Needless to say, I did NOT go back to sleep! 

I turned on KBOI radio at about 6:00 A.M. Later that morning to the news of a sighting by several others within a couple hundred mile radius.  A Nevada State Trooper witnessed what I saw while he was patrolling between McDermitt and Winnemucca, Nevada, (actually he was near Orovada, Nevada at the time).  An Idaho State Trooper near Murphy, Idaho also reported seeing a large glowing object.  A mother and daughter driving toward Boise, Idaho from McDermitt also saw and reported the object.  

One of the most interesting sightings, in my opinion, came from a man living near Boise. The man owned a private airplane, drove to the airport, started his plane and tried to get nearer the object, however, the object disappeared before he could get very far from the airport where he had departed.   

When my parents returned on Monday, the news had gotten to them before I had the opportunity to share my experience about it. We did spend a lot of time discussing it.  They were so disappointed they had gone back home and had missed the event.  I was so pleased to know others had witnessed this object.  The variety of witnesses was incredible.  It made news chatter for about a week and then faded out.

Again.......I know what I saw, and as I've stated before.....I DON'T DRINK nor do I ENGAGE IN DRUGS !!!

It was the last night of our 8 days Alaska cruise on August 9, 2012 aboard Royal Caribbean?s Rhapsody of the Seas.  We were sailing southeast, based on positions of the Dippers, at low speed from Victoria, BC to Seattle, WA at 11:30 PM.  We would pick up local port pilot at 12:30 AM to enter Puget Sound en-route to Seattle.  I could see some shoreline lights to the port (left) side of our ship. When I checked maps after arriving home, the shoreline must be Ebey?s Landing, WA and we were 2.8 miles from the shore.

Deck 9 Solarum is a large sunroom with an indoor swimming pool, a food bar, and tables and chairs for guests to relax and eat food.  Clear lookout windows occupy entire left and right sides of the room.

I was sitting at a table near a window panel with my wife and a friend, chatting. Not far from us were eight teenagers, probably made friends during the cruise and didn?t want to go back to staterooms too early on the last night of the cruise. There were five or six other people in the Solarum at the time and three crewmembers.

At around 11:30 PM, all the teenagers jumped up from their seats and lined up the windows, looking out. Two adult guests away from us also rushed to the windows. I first thought they saw a whale in the dark, sighting whales had been one exciting thing to do on this cruise. I stood up casually and looked out the window, and there was this craft with bright orange lights hovering over front starboard (right) side of the ship. I ran quickly up to deck 10 to get an open view, this craft has three bright orange lights forming a triangle, inside the triangle are smaller circulating lights forming a circle. The craft was absolutely silent, I looked at it for about 5 seconds and pulled out my iPhone, I moved my sight away from the craft briefly to my phone, wanting to set it to video mode. When I looked up again, the craft was gone. It was hard to estimate the size or elevation of the craft since I only had a brief look at it. I thought it was an exciting but way too brief an encoun! ter.

I walked to the port side to see if I could spot northern light since people had posted photos online of northern light taken in Vancouver in July, just one month earlier, and this night was the first time we had clear sky for any skyward observation. I could see dim low hanging lights but I convinced myself it was only inland city lights. That?s when I noticed an object with two or three orange pulsing lights above the ground at about 15 degrees angle. Since we were 2.8 miles from the shore, I would estimate the object was 3 to 6 miles from us, making its elevation at between 4,000 to 7,000 feet. This object stayed at the same spot for more than 10 minutes and I was convinced it wasn?t an airplane or helicopter. I called my friend in his stateroom and asked him to bring up his Nikon DX camera.

The friend came up to deck 10 ten minutes later. To this point, the object had been hovering at the same spot for more than 20 minutes.  He played with his camera?s focus and y speed for low light far-object shooting. He used the max zoom of his AF-S Nikkor 55-200mm lens, it?s probably 3.6x times 1.5 DX camera factor to 5.4x zooming.  The object just stayed near the same spot, from time to time shifting left-to-right and near-to-far, so my friend had plenty of time to adjust his camera, it wasn?t easy though because the low light condition.  The attached photos were all taken with the same optical zoom and cropped with the same digital zoom factor, from 4,285x2,848 frames to 500x400 frames.  One red point in one of the photos is a camera pixel defect.

At one point, we saw a small airplane flying to and pass the object.  As I was Google mapping, I noticed there are several small airports in the area.  At another point, which I missed, my friend saw two pulses of bright yellow flashes on the ground right below the object.  Our wives and a friend had also joined us to witness the sighting as well as two late shift crewmembers.  My wife described she could see circulating lights around the object.  Finally, around 1:30 AM the object moved inland and we stopped viewing.","Scientist with physics Ph.D. degree",17,1,"unknown",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2012,2010,3,8,23,"Night","West",1,0,0,0,0

Around 3:50 AM, I heard a large crash towards my backyard.  Whatever it was made the neighbors dogs bark loudly.  Afterwards, I jumped up look out of the bathroom window to see if someone was trying to break in.  I have an alarm system so I wasn?t too worried.  However, since the dogs kept barking, I decided to call my son (in the next room) on his cell phone to see if he would get up and go with me to go investigate.  He didn?t answer the phone.  My flood lights were on so I figured maybe it was just a small animal that was roaming out back for food.  For precaution, I put the television on to wait for a while to see what would happen.  

Shortly after 4 AM, I went ahead and turned off the television..  Shortly after, I was asleep when I heard another very loud sound on top of the roof followed by a sound like ?chhhhhhhhhh? boom.  Within seconds green lights beamed through by bedroom ceiling.  There were about 3 to 4 green lights evenly spaced apart shining through each side of the ceiling.  

Instantly I knew what it was and what was going on.  I was spread out on my back and something beamed through me for what seemed to be a minute or two.  As I silently prayed and asked God to make sure I wasn?t taken from my babies and to please be allowed to touch my daughter at least one more time.  I felt like my right hand was allowed to be extended, but a figure appeared and touched my hand instead.

My husband and I had just eaten a seafood dinner on our last night of our mini vacation. We decided to take a stroll on the beach before going up to the room for the night.  We were standing out by the pool of our hotel watching the ocean.  There was a mild breeze and we had just looked at the phone clock it was 9:02 pm.

It was a huge mirrored object that turned  like a bird while soaring.  It would change positions back and forth.  Then it slowly started to rise into the sky, still taking different directions until it finally was so far away that it looked like the north star.  But at the same time, it would brighten and dim.

I was driving on 119 South on the 4 lane heading to Belfry Middle School, my 6 year old daughter was in the back seat and asked, ""What is that thing in the sky?""  

We were around Wendy's at that time.  I watched it for a minute while driving and said ""I need to pull over and look at this thing"" we pulled over at Moore's, just below Food City.  By this time, it was moving upward and farther away from us.  We watched it in the sky until somewhere around the Marathon Station, just below the Middle School, where we lost sight of it because of the mountains.

We dropped my older daughter off at the Middle School, headed back down the road and I told my 6 year old to change sides so she could look out the other side of the car, to see if she could find it in the sky again.  She somewhere around South Williamson she yelled, ""There it is again!""

So I pulled over just before the you get to ARH and we watched it and I tried to video tape it (but it was on my phone and didn't really show up because I couldn't zoom) I lice closae by so I decided to go back home, couldn't see it there, so I decided to ride back out to ARH and watch it some more but on my way out, my neighbor was standing there with binoculars and I asked him, ""Are you seeing the mirror in the sky?""

My friend and I had just picked my brother up from a driver education course at 9:00 pm.  We stopped at a Taco Bueno to get some food on our way home.   As we were driving East on highway 20, we were about four minutes from where it goes from four lanes to two lanes, when I saw two bluish spotlights shining down on the oncoming lanes of traffic.

About the same time I saw this, the spotlights rose into a horizontal position, shining on my car when they did.  As the spotlights raised up I saw the underbelly of what seemed to be a trapezoidal middle with two right triangle shaped wings that held the big blue/white spotlights. The wings seemed more like anchors for the spotlights than actual wings.  They were not long and slender like and airplane, but were fat, short, and stocky with the spotlight on the ends.  The underbelly had four or six sets of rectangular greenish yellow panels on the front end and back end.  These panels seemed almost like you could see into the aircraft through them, like they were a type of viewing panels.  I saw these things so very clearly because this aircraft was only about the height of a two or three story building.  This aircraft was also not in flight, it was merely hovering, but it did kind of sway as the spotlights rose.

My friend was in the passenger seat and saw the exact same thing I did.  My little brother was in the back seat and from his position he couldn?t really see it.  My friend reminded me to pay attention to driving as the aircraft seemed to be preparing to fly forward.  As we drove past it I could no longer see the craft and told my brother to try to get a look.  My brother caught a glimpse of the bluish lights, but he did not see any detail.

This aircraft made absolutely no noise.  We did not have the raidio on at all in the car and as soon as we saw it we didn?t say anything but hushed ?are you seeing this?? and my brother?s quieted questions of what we were looking at.  If this thing had made a noise, like any craft that close to us would, we would have heard it.

Upon returning home I described this sighting to my mother, she sat down with us and we all explained in detail what happened. In the middle of my description, my mother gasped and covered her mouth. She quickly told me that as she was peeking out of the blinds, hoping to see our headlights (she was worried because us stopping to get food took longer than she expected), she saw something she had shrugged off as probably her imagination at the time. She saw a bluish spotlight shining up and then down our driveway and disappear. She didn?t see any cars before or after this light and she swore it was not any kind of headlight reflection or anything, it was like a light being shown from the sky.

I called my boyfriend who is an Intel analyst for the military and he assured me there is no aircraft in our military that is like the one I described.

BANGOR, Maine 

A city official driving home with his daughter Thursday night saw strange orange-colored balls of light in the night sky over Waterville and called the Bangor Daily News to find out what it was.

Shawn Yardley, director of the city<U+393C><U+3E32>s Department of Health and Community Services, described what the two saw as ""bright orange dots at cloud level.""

""They looked like Christmas lights, but they were orange,"" he said Friday, still looking for answers to what he witnessed.  ""They took up about a quarter-mile of sky and they stayed in place. It wasn<U+393C><U+3E32>t fireworks, because they stayed in place.""

Yardley was on Interstate 95 near Waterville and said the fire-colored orbs could be seen on the Oakland side of the highway.

""People were pulling off the road to look at them,"" he said.  ""If my daughter hadn<U+393C><U+3E32>t been there to witness the same thing, I would not have called. I<U+393C><U+3E32>ve never reported anything like this.""

Police and fire officials in Waterville, Winslow and Oakland, as well as the Maine State Police, said they took no reports of balls of light in the night sky, and the National Weather Service reported no unusual weather that could account for the lights.

""A string of lights [in the sky] is a very common UFO report,"" Alan Davenport, director of the University of Maine<U+393C><U+3E32>s Jordan Planetarium, said Friday.

Some prior UFO reports have proved to be aircraft flying away, he said. They appear to be stationary because they are so far away.

""That is what their taillights would look like,"" Davenport said.

Yardley<U+393C><U+3E32>s wife, Rita, asked him why he didn<U+393C><U+3E32>t take a picture of the balls of light with his cellphone, and he said he couldn<U+393C><U+3E32>t because ""I was on the phone.""

The National UFO Reporting Center, which has nine postings on its website from Maine for October, has taken reports of orange ""fireballs"" from all over the world.  There were no postings on the website for Thursday night.

There also are a couple of YouTube videos posted of people filming orange lights in the sky.

I went outside to feed my cats at around 21:30 and living out in the country I have very few lights so I have a clear view of the sky.  As I bent over to put cat food in the cat?s bowls I saw a streak of light from the corner of my eye as I was beginning to bend over.  I looked up and the first thing I saw was how bright the planet Jupiter was and then I saw another blast of light which pinpointed where the first light I saw had come from.

I stood there in awe with my mouth open because I could not believe what I was seeing.  It was a clear night with a few clouds and a soft breeze blowing and what I saw was a hole in the sky.  It was dark outside but enough light to show that clouds were around this hole but not blocking it.

Inside this hole which almost seemed like looking through a tunnel, it was very clear through it almost like it really wasn?t our sky.  It was full of dancing lights that moved around all over the place and once in awhile they moved together in synch.   One more time I saw a blast of light come from something inside this hole that exited and seemed to go into our clouds.  

The beam looked like this:   --------- --   ------   -- -------- -- ------------ -- ------------- -- -----------.   

It was long and short beams going in a straight line. No sounds were ever heard during all this.  Most of the lights were red and white with a slight amber color on one.

It seemed they were working on keeping this hole open and around the outside portion of the hole in what I think were clouds; they seemed to be manipulating the clouds or something into something that would appear alive.  In other words, the outside of the hole along with the inside of the hole seemed like a living entity. It moved very fluently as if looking around.

I totally could not believe this and I ran in the house and called my parents to see if they saw anything from where they live 20 miles away.

My dad said he saw something in the east but I told what I was watching was South East I went to my neighbors across the road and they stepped out and I had to point it out to them where to look.

They both stood there in amazement and couldn?t believe it either how these bright dancing lights moved inside, and how the outer portions of the hole would move as if it were alive. At that moment two packs of coyotes started to howl and my neighbor?s wife went in the house. I came back to my place and called my dad and then I went out to see if the hole was still there. It was, but this time much fainter and fewer lights are in it.

I can handle lights in a tunnel like hole but it bothered me how it was forming shapes that almost seemed humanoid at times.  The best way I can describe it is think of yourself as a tiny ant inside a hollow egg.  Someone comes along and drills a hole in the egg and puts his eye up to the egg to see the ant inside. The ant would see you and see you moving from his perspective outside that hole. That is what it looked like to me.  A giant peephole with something holding this hole open manipulating the area around it and then moving this animated matter in the shape of an animal or human reaching and grabbing things.

On December 18th, 2012 in Islip NY I was standing outside a friends home waiting for a ride back to my house.  Often at my house, since there is a clear view of the sky, I look up and hope to see a shooting star.  On clear nights I often do.   

So standing outside my friends home I decide to do the same.  I'm looking south and up to Orion's Belt.  I tilted my head back a little to see above me and I see many objects whizzing around.  The objects are red-orange in color and about twice the size of a star but only a fraction of the brightness.   As bright as something on the edge of a street lights view.  The objects flew like insects fly with sharp and fast darting movements.  The objects were moving quickly and as they were moving around they also all started moving south in direction and within two seconds had formed a large V shape consisting of about 7 red orange objects and a line of 3 following on the left side.  There were no streaks as shooting stars.  There was no sound.  

The formation of red orange lights continued what seemed now seemed slowly but smoothly on a southern course gaining height and flying towards Orion's Belt.  I did not look away, I reached for my phone to record video not looking away at all, but it did not load until the objects were out of view.  My friend showed up the literal second they disappeared.  I was still staring up in the sky and I yelled for him to come and look.  By that time the objects in the sky were gone.

This report details what I believe to be a sighting in the summer of 1987.

During the summer of 1987, in either July or August, I was on a canoe trip in Northwestern Maine-it was a program run by ((name of group deleted)).  I was 18 years old.  The trip was a circular route on the Moose River system, near the town of Jackman, and was of two weeks duration.  Twice during the trip our group (there were 8 or 9 of us- I can't remember exactly, it was a long time ago) was overflown by fighter aircraft flying very low and very fast.  Each such flight consisted of two-plane elements.

On the final day of the trip we camped on the shore of Attean Lake.  Looking now at a Google map, I believe we were camped on the North shore of the lake, very close to the railbed.  Each night of the field trip consisted of exercises designed to enhance our (the participants') understanding of the area's ecology and/ or fieldcraft skills.  

On the last night, we did two exercises:  a hike to the summit of the hilltop past the railbed, overlooking the lake, and following that, each participant was to write down his or her overall impressions, and what we learned from the trip.

To sum up the trip, each participant was to find a place of our own, separate from the other participants so that each summation would be the genuine thoughts of the person writing it down.  Then, following dinner back at the campsite, each participant would read what they had written to the others:  this was so the group leaders could evaluate the success of the trip, and so the participants could add to each others' knowledge base.  I remember walking about a half mile down the beach and finding a convenient log to sit on as I reflected on the experience.

This is where it gets interesting, but it only became interesting to me about ten years ago (important to remember here that the trip took place in 1987) as I was sifting through some old photos I had taken on the trip.  In the same bag as the photos were the notes I had written on that last night of the trip, detailing my impressions- and it occurred to me that we had never completed the exercise.  We had each taken our notes, but we had NOT done the group reading and assessment of them, as we were supposed to have done.  I wondered why, and thought about it hard- and here are the memories to the best of my recollection.

I had finished writing my notes, and was walking back down the beach towards the campsite.  There was a little sandy point adjacent to the campsite, and as I came around it, I noticed the moon out over the lake- it was intensely full and bright, though the evening was early with plenty of daylight left.  As I rounded the point, I could see the rest of the group sitting around the fire (I am not sure if all the participants were present at this time- one or two may still have been off on their own), looking out at the lake.  I looked out again too, and I distinctly remember how striking the moon was.

I carried with me an Olympus OM-1 camera- I had taken several rolls of film with me and got plenty of great photos of moose, other wildlife and landscapes.  This was a 35-mm camera with a manual light meter- you had to adjust the camera's settings using the light meter to get good photos.  I unslung the camera and aimed it at the moon, and flipped on the light meter.  It instantly registered overexposure.  I fiddled with every adjustment and could achieve nothing except overexposure.  I remember no conversation with other group members at this time, though I did look at them several times as I played with the camera- they were all looking at the moon.  Finally, I removed the batteries from the camera and again aimed it at the moon, and somehow it was still registering overexposure.  I remember that I was standing in the water up to my knees at that point.

The next clear memory I have is of waking up in my tent sometime much later that night when a train went past on the tracks above the campsite.  It was raining hard.  I have no recollection whatsoever of any moment between standing in the water to waking up in my tent.  I can only allude to ""missing time"" for reference to this time frame and I do not know what transpired therein.

The next morning, we packed up the campsite- there was uncooked food (beans) still in the pans, filled with rainwater.  Nothing about the previous night was discussed on the paddle back to the landing, though I do remember all the group members being extremely tired.

I might not have remembered any of this had I not been looking through  those old photos, but I believe it significant that the anomalies- the fact that we didn't discuss our impressions of the trip, nor did we discuss the events of that night- struck me immediately once I found the notes.  I remember the names of some of the group leaders but have not maintained any contact.

I wrote to the USAF to ask them why the fighter jets might have been in the area in that time frame, and received a reply from a Public Information Officer (a Major, I believe), who told me that such flights were common, and were likely routine training flights, originating from any of a number of bases, including Pease in Massachusetts or Loring, Maine.

As I came around a bend and closer to my home, it was apparent that the lights were moving but very slowly.  Almost hovering and all blinking in synchronicity and moving at the same time and direction.  

I pulled into the driveway and immediately got my husband to come outside to see what I was seeing.   The lights we moving extremely slow and then one by one blinking out of sight.  The last two of them were a lot slower and separate from the group and hovered over the trees next to the field by our house.  

They began in a formation where it looked like one behind the other.  Both of the objects blinking in exact time with each other.  It was close but absolutely silent.  

As they moved further from our house it actually looked like the lights were a part of something big. Meaning a light indicating the right and left side of something.  It was difficult to determine what shape it actually was.  

What I found very unusual about this was that these final two lights/objects got to the same point of the other five and then immediately blinked out of sight just as the other five before them did.

I made the delivery to the customer, and told them to come and see what I was seeing in the sky.   Another orange orb appeared, then another, and yet another.

The year is 1973, and the month is Oct.  It is around 8:00 PM, clear skies and a full or nearly full moon.  The location is southern central Indiana.  I was attending graduate courses at Indiana University.  I was a passenger in the front right seat and my children ages 4 & 5 yrs. were in the back seat.  We were returning from an afternoon in nearby Brown Co. state park, having already stopped for food.. I was looking at the sky out the window to see if I could discern any constellations to point out to the children.  I was startled to see three bright white large objects moving at great speed across approximately a quadrant of the sky.  I asked my friend driving to pull over and stop, which he did; and we all got out to observe.

The objects appeared to be at a quite high altitude but definitely within the orbit of the moon as they several times crossed in front of the moon and were quite visible as they were much brighter.  They were equal in size and appeared to be one sixth to one eighth the size of the moon.  Their movements remained within a quadrant of the sky, exhibiting incredible speed even during right angle turns.  My son commented that they were playing tag, which was an accurate description of their movements.  Several times two of the objects approached very close and began to spin about one another.  This maneuver reminded me of videos I?ve seen of eagles who lock talons in flight and spin about each other.

This activity continued for about 20 minutes, then they all departed outward toward space and within seconds were no longer visible.  During this event two other cars stopped to observe, so a total number of witnesses was eight.  When it was over everyone looked at each other somewhat wide eyed, and shrugging shoulders got back in their respective vehicles and departed as well.  No one spoke to each other.  I didn?t know any of the other witnesses and never saw any of them again.

After leaving the local convenience store (Coles) at 18:30 with two of my room mates in their car, my female room mate saw two red lights and one white light, which was brighter than the red ones, in a triangular formation, hovering in the dark in the usual area an aircraft  half way between taking off or landing can be seen, heading up or down towards the Airport, in a northern area in the sky above a fair distance above houses near the far end of Park Street adjacent to  the roundabout intersection on the top of Hastings River Drive.  I then looked back to see at least two red lights and one white light in the triangular formation. I continued to look as it stood still for 5-10 seconds and then moved up and over until it had moved it was upside down, 180 degrees. We then entered the roundabout and lost sight of the lights.

 Then again heading up Widerson street from Hasting River Drive I spotted the lights in the same formation, lower and closer to us, almost as if following behind us, motionless for 10-15 seconds before moving slightly closer. Panic kicked in so my female room mate and I stopped looking.

 We arrived home, in the area of Widerson street, calmed down and asked my male room mate who was driving the car if he had seen it. He didn't for the obvious reason. 5-10 minutes past from arriving home and my female room mate peered out the curtain of a window facing west and again the triangle patterned lights where there, not more than 75 meters away hovering low, this time my female room mate, my male room mate and I saw it, although our other male room mate was in the room but did not see the UFO. It stayed motionless in the sky and by the time I got out my phone to capture the UFO on camera it had vanished.

 My female room mate believe that from what she saw the UFO may have been bell shaped but she could not see the top. My male room mate and I cannot describe the UFO with any further accuracy than the three lights and their formation. One thing all three of us agree on is that the UFO made NO sound. Unfortunately my female room mate and I forgot to bring our phones in the car and my room mate who was driving didn't think to pass his phone to my female room mate or I.

 All three of us have spiritual beliefs close to spiritist. We have recently started a non-processed foods diet and we all have been making major life/career decisions the last few weeks. I meditate daily and recently have been researching zero point energy generators as well as electromagnetic gravity modifying devices and space crafts. When meditating I often ask guidance in the workings of these devices. I have also been creating 'energy centers' in our home to amplify our bio-electromagnetic fields (some people may not know anything about energy centers etc so just skip that if you want.)  The night before we witnessed the UFO I had an extremely lucid dream in which I was in a house, white light pored in from the windows and a tall and 'lanky' grey being entered the room. I felt no fear just excitement and curiosity as it approached. It seemed to communicate without physical sound. I conversed with it for what seemed like hours before it left. The dream then speed forwards to the next night. My mother was now also in the house with me as the same thing happened with the light poring in the windows. My mother was scared for my safety as I walked outside into the light. Nothing dramatic happened, once more I conversed with the same entity outside  and I asked my mother to come out side and meet this being, whom I felt I had known for a long time before meeting.

 As mad as this dream sounds I had to include it into this description as I feel it may be significantly related to the UFO sighting. I would like to ask if the person who reads this, weather or not it is put on the website database, could post their thoughts on the website and maybe any concerns you may have to convey about the intentions of the entities for which the UFO may be a part of.

((NUFORC Note:  Exceptionally reliable and capable witness.  PD))","St. Louis, Missouri - June 4, 2013: Spheroid object executes vertical climb to 25,000 ft. in less than 3 minutes

On Tuesday, June 4, 2013, at approximately 1:30pm, I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of  a St. Louis fast food restaurant for lunch located on Oakland Blvd. just east of Hampton Ave. and south of Interstate 64 and something to the northwest of me caught my eye.

Looking through the windshield, I saw something move rapidly in a circular motion and it vanished quickly.  As a result, I thought I was looking at a remote control model airplane or a bird.  The object was very dark against a fairly bright sky, below a scattered overcast. The object appeared to be very low over the distance treetops when in view, but momentarily vanished and I thought it went down below the tree line or the horizon.  I could not determine how far the object was laterally, from my position.  There was nothing behind it that it crossed to get a distance estimate.

I looked down to my sandwich and when I looked back up to the same location, (which was to my northwest), I saw an object, roughly spherical in shape, very dark, which began an immediate vertical ascent.

What put me into a sudden ""What the hell"" moment was that the object was moving straight up and pretty fast.  I leaned down toward the dash and crooked my neck to watch the sphere continue its vertical ascent as it kept going until it reached what appeared to be the cloud base (the cloud ceiling).

At that moment, the object then stopped moving and held stationary at the cloud base.  It remained stationary for approximately 2 minutes.  It could have been moving slowly to the right, or perhaps the clouds were moving slowly to the left, but after about two minutes, the object merged into the cloud above it and became obscured.

At its highest observed altitude (as it moved into the cloud), the object could be distinguished as a spherical shape, a black dot at this point.

As I observed the object , I was so captivated by what I was seeing that I failed to do a simple time count as it ascended; but the total time from near ground level to the cloud base at 25,000 ft. was not more than 3 minutes maximum, but could have been as little as 30 seconds.

Following the event, I placed phone calls to the nearby Forest Park administrative office as well as a local university's science departments and inquired if any kind of balloon had been launched. All inquiries came of negative.

I inquired into how to find the accurate cloud ceiling for the date and time of the sighting and was referred to the National Weather Service where I found the Three Day Weather records and June 4, 2013, data established the cloud ceiling at OVC250, which means overcast at 25,000 Feet, and that matched what I observed.

Using a speed and time calculator, I found the following possible indicated speeds of the object.  The following speeds are based on three estimated times for the object to travel from near ground level to 25,000 feet. 30 seconds, 1, 2, and 3 minutes.

3 Minutes: 94.69 MPH 
2 Minutes: 142.04 MPH 
1 Minute: 284.09 MPH
30 Seconds: 568.18 MPH  

Having seen a variety of balloons in the air, I?ve never seen a balloon ascend at these rates of speed, and although I cannot state exactly ?what? this object was, it must have possessed considerable size because I was able to observe the object at the cloud ceiling, or 25,000 feet.

If anyone else in the St. Louis area observed this object on June 4, 2013, I would very much like to see additional details.

I had just left my girlfriend?s house in Perrysburg, Ohio, en route to my home in Holland, Ohio (approximately a 9 mile trip).  I was travelling north of I 475.  About 2 miles before (Exit 6) my exit (Exit 8) off of I-475, I spotted a formation of lights to the west.  This was at 10:34 pm (because I immediately called my girlfriend to tell her what I was seeing).  To put this into geographic perspective, I would estimate the formation to have been south of Holland (but maybe still in Springfield Township) and north of the Maumee River/Lucas-Wood County line.  To be more exact, it started slightly south of I 80/I 90 (Ohio Turnpike).  I am not certain whether it was moving, due to my rate of speed (60 mph), but if it were moving, it was headed south.  It appeared, though, to be stationary.  The formation appeared to be somewhat close to the ground (much lower than a plane would be on approach to the Toledo Express Airport-4 miles away).  I would estimate the fo! rmation as having been 1/4 mile west of I 475.

I counted 12 lights at first, but then a 13th light appeared faintly, almost flickering, towards the end (northern tail) of the formation.  It brightened and its luminosity matched the other lights.  The formation changed slightly twice (as if a few of the lights were swapping places), but wholly in part, kept its original shape.  The lights never changed elevation so they were not floating or falling, and the color remained constant.  When I first noticed the formation, my first thought was, ?Wow, that is the brightest, closest constellation that I?ve ever seen.?  It?s then that my eyes noticed far more than the initial cluster of 4 or 5 lights and took in the entire formation.  The formation was at least 1.5 mile long and could have been as long as 2 miles.  Simply put, it was a line of 13 lights (with some derivation from a conceptual straight line) ascending at approximately 30 degrees.

I was unable to take a picture due to traffic conditions (too dangerous to pull over) and the fact that I was driving.  Once I reached my exit, I turned left and headed west about 1 mile and parked in a Boston Market fast food drive-thru.  I was looking south over a tree line and I would say that my car was almost perfectly lined with the tail of the formation.  At that point (2 minutes after exiting), I could still see 2 lights and they quickly disappeared (literally went out).  It was approximately 10:38 pm.  There was a male employee sitting on the curb of the parking lot waiting for a ride.  I rolled down my window and asked him if he had seen what I had seen.  He replied, ?No,? which wasn?t surprising (he was nose-first in his cell phone).

From there I traveled west 1 mile to my apartment.  I called media outlets, Lucas County Sheriff Dept, Lucas County Port Authority, Toledo Express Airport, Ohio State Highway Patrol, and the 180th Fighter Wing of the Air National Guard.  The media was uninterested and the law was annoyed.  The LCPA, Toledo Express, and The 180th assured me that flight traffic was at a minimum for the evening and that there was no radar evidence of a craft (or crafts) at that time/location.  The LCPA confirmed that the 180th was not running drills or maneuvers.  I also found a night kite flying group (online) based in Perrysburg.  I called their president this morning and he assured me that their flying grounds, so to speak, are located at least 10 miles to the south east of my sighting, and sometimes, weather permitting, 15 miles to the south.

I called the news outlets once again this morning and at least got WTVG Ch. 13 to take my name and number.  For research and record keeping purposes, I am a 32 year old white unmarried, but dating, man.  I have a B.S. degree in education and have worked in sales and marketing for the past 7 years.

My family has been in Redding CT for generations.  My grandmother told me countless stories of her own that took place in that town.  Although I didn't have my own experiences until my mid twenties.  Near my house, the Saugatuck Reservoir stretches miles of road all the way down to Wilton CT.  Towards the end of high school, my friends and I would marvel at the lights that were over the woods and reservoir.  They would move in and out of the tree line at a place called devils den, then emerge in plain view to hover in groups, sometimes as many as six.  I remember seeing these lights constantly after we discovered them, as soon as it got dark they were always there.

When I was 24, I moved back home for a couple months and totally forgot about the strange lights.  I never really knew what to make of them and don't believe in anything paranormal, so I dismissed them entirely.  Until one night when I was getting ready to watch a monday night football game with my friend and girlfriend.  I was placing an order for pizza on the phone, when my friend became fascinated with an on old dusty tin can loaded with change sitting on my shelf.  It had been there for years.  I looked at him, then at the can and noticed it was shaking and emitting almost a humming noise.  While I was placing the order on the phone, both him and my girlfriend got closer to the object and it got louder. Sure enough, my friend reached out to touch it and it flew across the room. Total elapsed time was about a minute.  Considering we were grown adults, we did not panic.  I kept saying it was a mouse or something, my friend kept joking that it was a ghost.  Needless to say, we coul! dn't do anything about it so we went to get our food.

When we got back, all of us began our ascent up the stairs when the door to my room suddenly opened seemingly for us. That spooked us down the stairs right away. I was the first to laugh, telling them that the door was most likely not properly closed and the motion of going up the old stair case jarred it free. My friend was adamant he saw the knob move, but I told him that has happened before and he calmed down. Old house, old door, no big deal. My friend stayed to eat, but left soon after claiming he was tired. About an hour later, I was lying on my bed watching the game, adjacent to a window that gave me a pretty good view of the sky. All of the sudden, a jet like object came into my peripheral. I looked over and saw it moving slowly, I was in the middle of pointing this object out to my girlfriend when it quickly went directly over my house, no more than 20 yards above the roof. Instantly, I ran outside and saw nothing. It was absolutely silent. I knew it couldn't have b! een a jet or helicopter, but I convinced myself it was.

The weeks after were strange. Doors kept opening, and I saw a figure constantly. The only way I can describe him was a silhouette of Abraham Lincoln. Tall, skinny and what looked like a top hat. I don't know what the hell that experIence was, but I moved out soon after that. My mother still lives in that house and started to tell me she has had experiences that she claims could only be 'ghosts', even though she never believed in that stuff just years ago.

I have since moved away, first to Newtown in 2011 when I had a similar experience that I reported to this site. For reasons unrelated to this activity, I am now in PA. and have not experienced any new activity in two years.

I returned to visit my family for a couple days. I never made sense of those experiences, but years later, I remain curious. I went back to the spot where I remember seeing those lights all the time, and sure enough they were there. Hovering, moving back and forth between the woods of devils den and wilton.

There was a very recent ufo report in wilton from dozens of residents that was reported in their police log. I have no idea what any of this stuff is or how it gets investigated, but I would tell any curious ufo hunter to go down to the Saugatuck reservoir in Redding on a clear night, for some reason I remember them being more animate on full moons, and watch the lights towards Wilton. A handful of times me and a friend saw them closer, below the tree line on Dayton road, the road alongside the entrance of devils den. Although I have been down that road many nights and the occurrence is rare. Try to make sense of it if you can, but I'm glad to be far away from the area.","coach",3,5,"formation",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2013,2010,2,6,23,"Night","Northeast",1,0,0,0,0

My friend and I (both of us are over 50 years old) were on the back deck about 9:00p.m. still daylight here, when looking North I saw what looked like a flare or small firework, that just showed up in the sky. I pointed it out to my friend. We were both amazed. The light was like 5 blocks away and grew in size with time till it was about the size of a single engine plane. It was bright orange, as bright as a wielders arch.  At the brightest point or top of the craft was a diamond shape. It had a tail that pointed downward. The whole thing looked almost as one but did have a shape in the top. All was very bright orange. It moved very slowly and made no sound what so ever. It flew at about tree top level, very close. It was slow enough I ran in to get the family. My daughter and her friend (both in mid-twenties) came out to watch. Four witnesses total.  It was not over the house by the time they came out, so the event was very slow.  We watched it go over the h! ouse and down the Snohomish valley and went out of sight as it made its way South towards Mt. Rainer. That whole event lasted about 30 minutes. We went into the house and were discussing what it might have been and wishing we had a camera. We were in the house for about 3 to 5 minutes and went out again to check the food, when my friend looked up to the North and said look and a second one of exact size, shape, color and speed, silently went on the same exact trajectory. It flew over the house and down the valley, until it went out of site in the far South towards Mt. Rainer again. These must have been under intelligent control as both were carbon copies in every way as the trajectory and behavior of both was exactly the same. It was not floating on the wind, as the wind was out of the east as it is most of the time in this area. I do not think we spoke for about 2 hours as we watched the sky stunned in amazement, but that was all there were.  I have seen strange things in t! he sky before but rationalized them away, as I am not a major believer in ufos. I would never have thought to report such a thing. However this was a major event and I felt responsible to report it. 

I will be watching the sky a bit more closely from now on.","retired goldsmith",4,2,"diamond",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2013,2010,3,7,21,"Evening","West",1,0,0,0,0

===========================  SPACE CHASE (Updated): On August 3rd, Japan launched a robotic spacecraft, the HTV-4, to re-supply the International Space Station (ISS). Last night, Larry Sloss saw the HTV-4 in hot pursuit of the ISS in the twilight skies over Priest Lake, Idaho:  ""The HTV-4 was trailing the ISS by just 3 seconds,"" says Sloss.

 Many observers noted ""HTV-4 flares"" this week. Apparently sunlight is glinting off a flat surface of the spacecraft, briefly raising its luminosity to match that of the much larger ISS. Sloss saw one too: ""In the image, a brief, bright flare from the HTV-4 is slightly offset from the ISS trail.""  HTV-4 has an interesting payload.  Among the 5.4 tons of food, spare parts, and other supplies are Kirobo, a talking robot to join the crew of the ISS, and Firestation, an experiment to study mysterious Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes.  Update:  The HTV-4 docked to the space station at 11:38 EDT on Friday, Aug. 9th.  Unloading has commenced.

As I reported to the NUFORC on Saturday night having spoken with Peter Davenport:  At approximately 22:57, 24 August, 2013, inside the city limits of Coloma, Michigan, 49038, on 459 Park Street, in a grass alley behind the house, outside of the old motorhome I live in, I went outside to retrieve a crate & bag of cat food from a storage shed.  

				I was facing due North at 00 Degrees Azimuth & out of the corner of my right eye I looked up and saw a large Orange Ball-Shaped Object moving at a slow speed toward the 00 Degrees Azimuth.  I walked to my right to get better look outside of the branches of a large tree & saw 2 more Orange Spheres in  line with the 3rd.  They were moving rather slowly, like a Gaggle of Helicopters would travel, approximately 500 feet  Above Ground Level.	 		At the time, the Moon had risen to about 135! Degrees Angle & the Orange Spheres were each about the size of one-tenth of the rising Moon.   

The 3 Orange Spheres were also giving out a light similar to a multi-pointed Star.    							                                                                                                                  					 
As I watched, I walked forward on the grass alley and with awe & amazement, I kept saying out loud, ?Oh, My Gosh! Oh, My Gosh! Oh, My Gosh!   Oh, My  Gosh!?      	                       		                                                                            							 
The first of the 3 Spheres, went out & I saw a Star in the distant which went out. The 2nd & the 3rd Spheres seemed to stop moving for about 10 seconds & then proceeded to follow the 1st Sphere & the 2nd Sphere went out & the 3rd Sphere went out.  There was no sound emitted from the Crafts. Maybe traveling about a 100 Knots per Hour?                                                           		    

							I was so e xcited!  I called a TV station in Chicago, which is quite progressive, but was put on hold then disconnected 3 times. I asked before the fourth if I should call back the next day, & was told ?Yes.?  I then called the Berrien County Sheriff?s Office who did not know what to think of me. I asked for the telephone number to the Michigan State Police & after 3 different officers, last being a shift Capt., with the same disinterest. I did ask if they received any more reports to let me know??                                       									

I then went inside my motorhome & looked up a reporting center for UFO?s & found this one & called & spoke with Peter Davenport.  He told me that he had just received reports from 2 other callers before me.  Asked if I was near Detroit, Michigan. I said no, I was on the other side of the state.  Being about 22 miles direct north of Indiana & about 90 miles from Chicago.  I am about 5 miles East of Lake Michigan.  

						I consider myself to be very! fortunate for this experience.

I was driving in Statesville North on Turnersburg Hwy.  I had just passed tractor supply when I noticed traffic was slowing down.  I looked around to see why, ie ""Was there an accident?"" 

About 1/2 mile up the road in the air above the field between the Captains Galley Seafood Restaraunt and an abandoned old run down building, there was something in the air.  

My windows were rolled down and I heard NO noise.  

I had taken my dog for a ride to the local fast food for a treat.  My windows were rolled down and he was crying anticipating good, however when we got to the Fort Dobbs hardware store (which is where traffic started slowing down), he immediately became completely and totally silent.  There was just silence everywhere.  

In the air were two giant gold balls with seemed to emit a very strong glow.  That was all I could see.  The balls were hovering about 30 feet in the air over the field.  The balls floated in the air in that exact position for ar! ound four minutes.  

The balls then started to spin around in a circular pattern starting slow but rapidly becoming faster until they became a blur.  

The craft then disappeared across the night sky traveling NE in a streaking, golden blur.  

I KNOW I am not the only one who saw this.  I am positive it wasn't because of any tower or anything like that.  I even stuck my head out of my drivers side window to make sure what I was seeing was actually real. 

 I listed it as only one witness because of myself, but there were in fact at least 10 other people who saw this craft as traffic essentially came to a standstill.","Engineering Student",1,1,"unknown",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2013,2010,3,9,22,"Night","South",1,0,0,0,0

I had my clock set for 22:00 hours to alarm, but I could not sleep so I got up at 21:30.  When I left the house I noticed a light in the sky.  I thought it was an aircraft but looking again I did not see any of the anti collision lights aircraft have.  I was heading up to Beatties Ford Rd, keeping an eye on the light.  I made a right and saw there were two lights and also noticed that they were orange with a red hue at times.  I hurried up to the parking lot of Food Lion on Beatties Ford Rd, got out of the car noticed there were three.

They ranged from 85 degrees to something like 60 degrees above the horizon.  Each object disappeared once they reached the 60 degree mark from horizon one by one.

I needed a witness and pointed them out to a guy that was passing by.  He said he did not know what they were but he kept walking.  

Tried to take a picture with my phone camera, but that did not work since the moon's light was too bright and the objects were too high.

This was witnessed by one of my employees and his wife while my employee was working the graveyard shift last night.

At approximately 0400 US central time, my employee walked outside of the plant for a security check.  He observed due east of our location a pulsating light in the sky that at first appeared to be a star or planet.  From his perspective it was about the same size as a bright star or planet like Venus, but again, the light was pulsating from relatively dim to bright, back to dim then back to bright, etc.  The apparent altitude was about two fingers' width above the horizon.

After he had been watching it for about 20 minutes off and on (he was in and out of the plant checking operations) his wife arrived to bring him some food while on her way to work.  This was at about 0430.  They were both watching it when she spotted a second almost identical pulsating light that he hadn't previously seen move from the north side of the original object to its south side.

After the second object moved to the south side of the first object, the first object started to move higher into the sky, as though gaining altitude without moving in any other direction, forward, backward, or sideways.  He started thinking that the lights may have been helicopters, but he had the further impression that if they had been helos they were close enough that he could've heard their engine or rotor noise.

After the first object increased its altitude about two to three times what it had been previously, it became stationary.  The one that had moved south of it was stationary the whole time the first object was moving.  After the first object once again became stationary for a few minutes, the second object to the south slowly descended until it was no longer visible above the horizon.  It was not seen again.

Several minutes after the second object disappeared below the horizon, the first object started moving slowly to the south, gradually gaining speed until reaching an apparent speed comparable to what is observed of a jet aircraft at high altitude.  Within 30-45 seconds the object was no longer visible, having passed the southern horizon.

Total time of observance was about 45 minutes to one hour.  During the entire time there was no discernible sound coming from either object.  Background noise from the plant was minimal.

It was mid-summer in 2008, I estimate around the time of June around 10pm at night. Myself and a friend of mine left our home to grab some food from a nearby chinese takeout.  As we walked along the road, I glanced up into the sky above the restaurant and noticed 5 solid orange lights, in a diamond/kite formation silently hovering.

I estimate the distance to these crafts from ourselves at approximately 250m away, we paused in our tracks and simply observed what was happening.  The two points of light on either side of this formation(the left and the right respectively) began to slowly move towards each other, in a very smooth and seemingly controlled manner, passing each other and becoming stationary in each others original position (essentially these two lights cross paths and swapped sides on this formation), around 60 seconds later they reverted back to their original positions before disappearing, leaving only 3 lights remaining.

These 3 lights began descending to what I would estimate approximately 100m in height above us, and began moving down the street towards us, passing over head.  The formation had became somewhat of a .. ""convoy"" following one after the other in single file.  The first of the 3 lights passed by approximately 50m and as it did so, the solid orange light emitting from the first craft, simply turned ""off"".  Now that the glare of the lights were gone, we could see a circular craft of some sort, silhouetted  against the night sky, it was rotating anti-clockwise very slowly.

 We could tell the craft was rotating due to the fact there appeared to be some kind of components on the exterior hull, slightly darker in colour than the craft itself.  The craft was a silver raw metal kind of colour, as it continued by we stared at this craft intently but strangely enough.. without blinking or turning away, the craft vanished.  It didn't whiz off at high speed, or make any jerky movements, it was there and then it wasn't..

The second and third craft did exactly as the first craft had done, it moved over our heads around 50m away from us with the lights turning off at the same point as the first craft, the same type of craft was seen silhouetted against the sky, spinning anti-clockwise very slowly, with the same outside markings as the first craft. It too simply vanished while looking right at it, as did the third craft moments later.

There was absolutely no sound, no humming or vibrating which also puzzled us both. My friend observed everything I did, standing no less than 2m away from myself on the corner of the street.

I am fairly certain these were not Chinese lanterns, as their path of flight and movement appeared to be extremely steady and controlled, I do not believe paper chinese lanterns can move in a controlled manner, they're carried by the wind and these objects were clearly not affected by the wind.

 In hindsight, I do not know why I did not attempt to take any pictures or evidence of this encounter. The reason it's taken me 5 years to make a report of this sighting, is for two reasons:  1) Every time I bring up this encounter with anybody, friends, family, strangers, I am subject to ridicule and people questioning my sanity.

 2) I have struggled trying to locate the proper authorities to report this to whilst living in the UK. I thought about reporting to an American organisation however I was unsure if it would be accepted, given I am not residing in America nor did the sighting take place there.

I went outside to wait for a friend to pick us up to go and work at our church?s food pantry. My wife was still inside at the time.  The sky was clear. As I looked to the south  I saw an object that I will say looked like a little pure white marble moving horizontally at about 30 degrees above the horizon.  At first I thought it was a small airplane but staring at it revealed nothing betraying shape (fuselage, wings, tail)- none of these.  It seemed like a round sphere, pure white and not reflecting flashes of sunlight as planes often do, just a dull white color.  It moved along at an absolutely steady rate parallel to the horizon.  No sound came from it nor was there any trail visible behind it. I watched it proceed  smoothly  along  for about  ten to twenty seconds and then ran over to the door and yelled for my wife to come and see.  By the time she and I got to the vantage point it had disappeared. I thought immediately, ?Ok, cloud cover.?  Then I realized, th! e sky was clear.  I don?t know if it vanished, flew away, winked out or what.  All I know is that in the ten seconds it took me to go to the door, yell and return it had gone.

My impression was that whatever this was was flying at about eight to twelve thousand feet at a distance of about one to three miles from my vantage point.

Very surprised and somewhat shocked,  I saw two amber lights that I first thought were airplanes.  Flying at about the same altitude as planes.  

I then realized as they moved closer over head there were no blinking lights.  I see a few high altitude planes every night or so.  They appeared to stay an exact distance apart and were gliding slowly.  I was certain that they were not stars because as the moon remained stationary they continued to move close from ESE to WSW.

When the clouds broke I was able to see one through the break.  Clouds enveloped again and I could no longer seem them when a large break appeared.

I saw a blue light coming East toward the beach.  We have a lots of air traffic because of the West Palm Beach International Airport, but I never noticed a steady blue light on any aircraft before.  

First I thought is some reflection on the windshield, but when it was over us, I rolled done the passenger side window and stick out my head. It was right above us.

It was a U shape steady blue light, going slow to the East, then suddenly it speed it up so fast that is just not possible.  Then, we were going toward to South on SR7 and I was still seeing it on the North side.  It was going very slow then suddenly changing directions and speed up so fast that is just not possible.  It was above us for 2-3 minutes.  

Then, we arrived to the restaurant (PeiWei) at Forest Hill and Wellington Greens corner at Wellington Mall.  We went in but the food was not ready yet.

My sister and I were in the car one Wednesday night, while my mother went into a home to take food due to a death in the family.  We saw a round object moving above the tree line that was about one hundred yards off.  The object appeared to be lite from within. I was mainly red with yellow and white streaks.  The color was like looking at a light shining through the skin between your fingers. It moved at a steady pace across the top of the trees.  The color did not change and there were no changes or movement, just a round ball moving across the sky.

I have tried to find out the exact date of the sighting by looking up the date of death of the person who died (I think his name was Jimmy Isley).  But, I have not been able to locate this information.  I do know that I was around twelve or thirteen years old.  This would make it 1967 or 68. It was chilly but not cold.  So, it was probably either spring or fall.  The house was on Mt. Carmel Church Rd, about a fourth of a mile off Hwy 14 (now loop).  This is half way between Reidsville and Eden NC.

I have told this story for years to anyone who would listen. Some say it was a gas pocket from the creek some three or four miles away. I doubt this is the explanation. I am not sure what it was. But, it was strange and unforgettable.

On the night of June 7, 2014, at approximately 9:50 pm (Eastern Time), I was driving up the hill on Culler Road (heading in the direction of South) in Weirton, West Virginia, (Hancock County) to go get something to eat at a local fast food drive-thru.  It was a night with no precipitation and some stars were visible and the moon looked small and faint as if maybe behind a few thin high clouds in the Eastern sky.  

As I neared the top of Culler Road, before reaching where Montgomery Avenue meets Culler Road, I looked out my driver?s side window because some very obvious and strange lights were visible in the sky way over top of the roofs of the houses that line Culler Road on my left.

The lights were very bright and light-orange in color.  They were spherical in shape and hovered in the sky lined up in a horizontal pattern and separated from each other with some spacing between them.  They did not appear to blink or flash upon looking at them with just my eyes.  

I was so astonished at the sight of these lights that I sped up my car to get to the intersection of Palm Drive and Culler Road so I could pull off on the side of the road on Palm Drive to get a better look at these lights.  Culler Road had no berm to pull over onto so I had to get onto Palm Drive.  Within about a minute I was on Culler Road and I pulled my car off the road and parked into a cleared area on the right side of the road and I got out of my car.

The lights were extremely bright and obvious in the sky.  I had never seen such lights in the sky before.  They did not appear to be airplanes as they continued to hover and move very slowly in the Eastern sky moving from my Right to my Left which would be moving in the Eastern sky from South to North.  

What amazed me so much was that they kept a controlled distance from one another the entire time and they moved in unison and formed, the majority of the time, a straight horizontal line, but at one time I saw some of the lights form almost a right angle with some lights appearing more in a slanted vertical line and others in a horizontal line.  In another instance I remember thinking they almost look like a ?Big Dipper? pattern but with maybe one or two ?lights? missing from that familiar pattern.

As they slowly moved from Right to Left in the sky, the lights in the far-most left would eventually grow dimmer and eventually fade away while additional lights, one at a time, would rise up from the horizon toward my right in the eastern sky and continue to join the trail in the right-to-left movement pattern as the other ones had followed.  They did not move fast.  They moved at a pace between ?hovering? and ?very slow? and the distance between each light remained almost constant (some did not catch up to others or surpass others?all lights followed the one or ones that were in front of them that were more to the left and moving northward).  All lights moved from south to north (my right to my left) and none stayed stationary or backtracked in the opposite direction.  

I took out my iPhone 5 and opened the camera app and took a few still shots and then decided I should set it on video but was unsure if my phone?s camera would pick up what I saw.  I was able to get a few stil! ls and one short video.

In looking back on this experience, I should have tried to count them or call the police or someone else to document what I was seeing because I was alone with I witnessed this.  My estimation was that I saw at least 20 or more individual lights total.  I don?t know how many more might have been in the sky before I was driving up Culler Road where they caught my visual attention that night.  I thought perhaps it might be something from the Pittsburgh Airport or the Air Force base which are both in the direction of where I was looking that night from Palm Drive.  The airport is approximately 20 minutes by car from Weirton and it is northeast from Weirton.

I called the police 2 days later and also the news station in Steubenville, Ohio which is the city across the Ohio River from Weirton and both said they did not receive any reports of these lights.  I was frustrated because what I saw was definitely something I had never seen before in my entire life.  

I am a 62-year-old male with a master?s degree in a profession.  I am not any ?UFO nut? and am really not sure if extraterrestrial beings or vehicles exist.  I felt maybe these could be some experimental drones or something that the military could be testing at night.  Whatever they were, they were controlled and by no means did they randomly travel across the sky.  They were organized and lined up and spaced themselves as if controlled by some source or intelligence intentionally.  They made no noise or sound in the sky.

I called the National UFO Reporting Center in the State of Washington after doing a Google search of where to report UFOs because the local police and news station treated my verbal report with no interest or concern.  I spoke directly with Peter Davenport who told me he is the director of this organization, and he advised me on how to submit a report and, to keep it ?clean,? without bias or contamination, to not read other reports on that website until after I complete my report.  I will complete a report to this UFO Reporting organization and will also submit my still photos and my short video taken from my iPhone 5 on the night of June 7, 2014.

June 22nd 2014 approximately 9 p.m.

I walked outside to get in my truck and go pick up some food and I saw a light in the sky and I thought to myself that's too big to be a star. Is that an airplane? No it looks like something is on fire. Is it moving? Slowly. It looks like it is rising. As I am standing with my face southwest the object was moving southeast and rising.

As I am getting my phone out to get video of this, another one appears to the right.  I took some video, and as I was putting the phone away, I saw another one appear from the right, so I started video again I did not video very long because I figured it was not picking it up very well.  

When I put the video on my computer and enhanced, it looked round, yellow in the middle and red around the outside like a fireball.  

I am putting the videos together on windows live movie maker and posting to youtube.  The quality is bad.  I am hoping someone or I will be able to enhance the video better and get a better look.

I was standing in line to buy an ice cream when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.  Looking up, I saw two red glowing orbs moving very slowly towards us.  There was no sound - although if there were, I probably wouldn?t have heard it above the music ? just a gentle pulse of warm light.

I asked the boy in front of me what he thought they were and he just shrugged.  The orbs then stopped and just hung in the sky for a couple of minutes and then, moments later, the two objects took off in the direction from which they came at what seemed to be warp speed because in a millisecond they had become just two tiny points of light before disappearing.

The brightness increase put it above every other star in the sky, even more luminous than a full moon, but the apparent physical size was smaller.

Yesterday (September 9, 2014) I was watching a bunch of UFO shows on direct TV and they mentioned your organization.  Up to this point I did not know there was a place to report UFO sightings.

My wife and I lived in Manitou Beach, Michigan between June 1998 and July 2002.  I believe it was the fall of 1998 when I had an experience with an unidentified flying object.  

I drove from my house on Devils Lake Hwy to Brooklyn, Michigan, in the evening to pick up some Chinese food for supper.  Returning home, I drove south out of Brooklyn and drove down Brooklyn Rd., which runs next to MIS (Michigan International Speedway).  When I arrived at the corner of Brooklyn Road and US12 I saw an object in the night sky which appeared to be approximately above Round Lake Highway.  

I pulled off the road at the corner and sat in my car watching the object.  The object appeared to be the size of a basketball, it changed colors from yellow, to orange, to blue on the perimeter and appeared to be emitting sparks.  The object moved extremely slow and ran parallel to US 12, moving from the west to the east, and the object was approximately 100 feet above the tree line.  I watched this object for approximately 15 minutes and it maintained the same height, never changing its altitude.

I served in the United States Navy and US Army National Guard.  The object had characteristics of a flare with some notable differences.  Flares do not maintain their altitude and fall to the ground diagonally unless there is a strong wind - and there was no wind.  

I thought about a meteor but the item moved much to slow.  I tried to put a rational explanation as to what I was seeing in the night sky but came up empty.  

At this point, I had worked for the Michigan Department of Corrections in Parole/Probation for over 10 years, and believe I?m a confident observer.  I watched the item from the time it was over Round Lake Highway until it had moved on its easterly course until it had probable passed over M50, at which time I decided to head for home, but the object continued on an easterly course at the same height and continued to follow US 12.

The though crossed my mind that I was witnessing an Unidentified Flying Object, which alarmed me to some degree, but I thought the item was small to be a flying saucer and, unless they have a shrink ray, there would be no way for the object to abduct me or beam me aboard.  

I thought the object might be a probe, but the only significant land mark in the area is Michigan International Speedway.  I should also note there are no military installations in the area and there was no events taking place at Michigan International Speedway, so there was no reasons for a flare to be in the night sky.  

I?m extremely confident that what I saw was not a flare of any type and that?s why I?m writing to you to report an unidentified flying object.  If we had cell phones with cameras back then, I would have loved to have taken a photograph of the object because it was really interesting.  This is the first time I?ve told anyone of the incident with the exception of my wife and kids.

Throughout the shows that I watched I did not see any reports of UFO?s matching the description of the item that I saw but found the vast array and variety of spacecraft reported which makes me wonder if we?re not being visited by various entities, and then that brings up the logical question - why?  DNA samples, intelligence gathering, mapping, scientific studies by entities visiting our planet lead me to the question of intention.  While I was in the National Guard I served as an intelligence analyst for awhile and it was my job to evaluate potential threats and create counter measures.  Time after time I have seen on the shows about UFO?s visiting earth where the spacecraft have been around military installations and other vital infrastructure around the world.  Often we hear a comparison between technological differences and how earthlings are new to the cosmic scope and how entities visiting earth are so much more advanced - but then there are reports of so many cra! shed space ships.  Even in our infancy we have gps, collision alarms for aircraft (and cars now), and a host of other technological devices - so it seems rational to believe any advanced entity would also have these items so I?m not sure why there would be so many crashed spaceships.

In closing:  I believe in what I see with my own eyes.  I cannot put a rational explanation to what I saw (which does not mean there is not a rational explanation).  Even if I had not experienced an unidentified flying object I believe there is life beyond earth just as a matter of chance - as a gambler you play the odds and if you look into the heavens you would have to be ignorant to believe we are alone.  I think it is shameful UFO sighting are not taken seriously by governments around the world because as an intelligence analyst you need data in order to reach conclusions and to come up with logical responses.  I graduated from Western Michigan University with a double major - Criminal Justice/Sociology, which means I like to collect evidence, look at it and draw my own conclusions.  I also like to study people and societies and cannot help but wonder why some societies seem to have more experiences with other entities then others and wonder what significance this ph! enomenon has in the larger picture.

It was night time, and I was going for a casual walk at the Huacheng Square walkway near the IFC building and also near the Guangzhou opera house and the presently constructing Luk Fuk building.  I decided to take a quick rest at the Mall of the World, which was underneath the Huacheng Square walkway.  Shortly after my rest I decided to go back outside into the warm, humid Guangzhou heat.

I then made my way over to the end of the walkway and the end of the square, which was near the Guangzhou Asian Games Stadium and the Canton Tower, as well as near the side of the Pearl River.  As soon as I arrived near the end of the square, I noticed that there were lots of people.  It was very crowded that night, and I realized that it was the first day of Mid-Autumn Festival (aka Moon Cake Festival).  There were many street vendors and lots of people with their friends and family eating food, as well as taking pictures of the wonderfully lit ornaments and the quickly changing colorful lights of both the Canton Tower and the IFC (Four Seasons) building.

I decided to walk ahead closer to near the river side, but the way there was blocked by barrier, as there was a large ornamental display bearing the shape of a traditional Chinese junk ship (without sails), and a led or neon-lit sign the posted Chinese characters, translated as Happy Mid-Autumn Festival and welcoming of happiness or such (since I?ve studied Chinese for four semesters in China before).

Next, I made my way over to the barrier closest to the river, but was also near other people taking pictures.  I was gazing around the buildings and the night sky.  Occasionally I would see an airplane or two from the far distance to the East and the South of the Canton Tower, with ordinary flashing beacons and navigation lights.

	Once more, I then gazed across over to the north to see the wonderfully lit IFC building, as well as the construction of the Luk Fuk building. I then turned around to face the river side once more, but something caught the attention of the corner of my left eye. I then turned left towards the east to see a far away red light (brightness similar to an aircraft). It must?ve been at least half a mile out on the horizon, as far as I could see. The amber-red light appearing distant at first, then gradually brighter as it was making its way over towards me (heading west-ward).

The night sky was clear, but there were some low-lying clouds and slight fog or mist closer to the ground and river. It was a also a little breezy near ground level. Gazing towards the red light, I thought at first it was just an ordinary aircraft, and thought that maybe the fog or possible city pollution caused the aircraft?s lights to appear redder instead of a typical incandescent yellow-white. But as the red light drew nearer, I realized it maintained a constant color, and it was coming at a slight decline angle. Then as it drew even nearer to me, it quickly disappeared into the nearby low-lying clouds.

Curious, I still kept my eyes open for any other activity. To my surprise the red light came out of the clouds and continued westward, and finally made its way over the festival square. As it passed over me (about a 75-85 degree angle above my head to the north of me), I noticed an unusual shape. Although it was dark, I was able to make out a round, almost oval-like shape.  It was neither perfectly circle nor perfectly oval. To my eye, it appeared to be roughly between the size of an aspirin pill and a penny (or a Chinese wu jiao coin).

The color appeared to be a grayish, slightly white-blue color, and there was a slight reflection on the object from the surrounding city lights. As it passed over me, I noticed that the object made no sound (no motor or engine noise), from what I can recall, except for a faint ?cutting through the wind?.  Gauging the craft?s distance up above the ground, the object must?ve been at least 500-600 feet above the ground, but no more than 1000 feet, I reckoned. It was about as high as the lowest flying domestic aircraft flying over the city, but a bit lower.

As it continued over me (over the festival square), it quickly fluttered some violet, blue, blue-green, red-pink, and a bit of green lights. Sort of like temporary beacons or special kind of navigation signals, I suspected. It must?ve done this signaling at least twice or thrice, but very rapidly, in a glimmering, sequential and reverse-sequential fashion. By the time I realized that this was no ?ordinary? object or ?craft?, I decided to pull out my Smartphone to take a pictures.

By the time I got my phone camera ready, the object then sped up quickly towards the west, towards the direction of the Guangzhou Opera House and past other buildings in that direction (i.e. the Baoli Center Building), then quickly ascended and faded away.  A bit curious, I still had my phone out of my pocket. Some people (two couples, and a small group of two to three people) nearest to me noticed me attempting to take pictures of something in the sky, but they must?ve thought nothing of it at first.

About two to three minutes later, I notice the exact same amber-red light (as the object had when entering from the east), but this time appearing to the southwest of the Canton Tower. It must?ve been several hundred feet above the large high-rise apartments directly on the other side of the Pearl River. It was hovering for at least half a minute, then slowly ascended, paused and hovered for a few more seconds, then gradually continued westward and ?disappeared?. By this time I had already taken a few snapshots from my phone.

About a less than a minute later, I notice the exact same amber-red light near and above a large building the west of the Guangzhou Opera house. It was hovering for at least half a minute, then ascended slowly again, but this time, the amber-red light began to pulsate (almost undulating). It must?ve done this for a few seconds at a time, within one to two minutes max, then ascended higher, and gradually disappeared.

At this time, I had already had taken a few more snapshots from my phone, and there were at least three to five other people that pointed to the object, and took some snapshots, but they appeared to not be surprised, but rather amused (as if it was nothing very special).  Unfortunately, my phone?s camera resolution and quality wasn?t the best, the object appeared dimmer in the pictures than in real life.

About a few seconds later, the amber-red light appeared again near the direction I last seen it (toward the west of the Guangzhou Opera house and neighboring buildings). About a few minutes more it hovered and ascended gradually on and off, occasionally with a pulsation, then it slowly made its way southward towards the Pearl River, and disappeared again. During this time I had taking more pictures of it. I had also noticed that another couple near me had pointed to the object discretely, and took a quick snapshot from their Smartphone, showing some interest. I did not bother to ask them as I was afraid I would ?sound? or ?look? like a fool.

About another minute later, I noticed the same amber-red light, but this time, further in the east, even further east of the Liede Avenue Bridge. It was a little higher in the sky, and was more distant, and was less visible because of the low lying clouds and fog. It must?ve hovered in place for a least another one to two minutes, then disappeared again for another few minutes. I was able to take a picture of this period of time. As you will see in the related photograph, one can barely notice it with the naked eye, but if one was to open the photo, one can zoom-in closely and notice the slight color in the midst of the clouds.

Shortly after that period of time, it again appeared to the slight southwest of the Canton Tower and towards the high rise apartments directly across the Pearl River.  Again, the object, hovered, and moved slowly toward the west, and slowly ascended, then changed direction in the opposite direction and hovered another few seconds more, and disappeared again.

To my wonderment and disbelief, I had realized by this time that there was something strange about this object. It could?ve not been any ordinary aircraft. It was not in any perceivable way, identifiable, and the only two things I could suspect were that object was either of terrestrial or was non-terrestrial origin. Military flares? I?m not familiar with any flares that fly and behave the way that object did. Whether the object was of terrestrial (military-government or non military-government) origin, or non-terrestrial origin, it was indeed unusual in its appearance and behavior. What it was not was any conventional aircraft.

Again, I can neither conclusively prove nor disprove that this object was either terrestrial or non-terrestrial, but what I can conclude was that I experienced seeing something out of the ordinary, and without any recollection of the unknown.  Shall anyone choose to believe or disbelieve my experience; it is their choice, with rightful reasons to their own thinking and opinions.

My daughter came over to my house dropped some food off and left,  She within a few minutes cam back and said ""mom get and the car you have to look at this"". I went with her and we went around the block, i looked up to the south of me i can see 3 bright objects in the sky they were once by each other and then did a loop around each other.  One disappeared and then there was two. I continued to look on with perfect bliss. The one the dissapeared came back brighter then before.  I decide to go inside as my daighter has to leave.  One by one, they started to fade away.

I went back in side as if it was over and something told me to look out side there this object again in the same place this time i took a pictue. This time it was huge orange in the middle and a white i guess you can say a fluffy coat on the out side. There was no moon out so i know it was not the moon.These ships or space crafts came about 2 times with in a hour same spot did not move nor had no sound, just quite.

I called the navy base as i am located in bremerton and they told me nothing was in the sky at that time, nor did they see anything. Do I believe then no..

I see these objects in the sky all the time in the sky i know what they are.This may sound strange but i have dreams like i am in a ship i see eartu from afar, i see what is going to happen to us and what i dreamt last year already happen. Are they messages o dont know but i listen.

They were about 3 football field's up facing north after they came from the south. It is a clouldy day today, light showers, no moon.

I then communicated with it telepathically, and asked it to come closer. Then the one orb divided into a whole fleet of brilliant and spectacular white orbs, forming a whole fleet of about one hundred orbs, and moving from North to South. I could not believe my eyes, and stood there in total shock. This man happened to be walking by me, and I pointed to the orbs. He also saw them. He just happened to have a knife, and cut open the plastic container holding my binoculars. We both looked through the binoculars and saw the UFO fleet. The whole vision lasted about five minutes.

As I was driving on the west-most side of the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Prescott campus, I saw light in my peripheral vision and quickly looked up to my left out the driver's side window.  I saw a strange grouping of three soft white lights moving at a VERY high speed flying east straight overhead over the campus.  The strangest thing was that I hadn't heard any roar of engines or a sonic boom from the speed.  

I called an associate, who I knew was out walking nearby, to ask if he'd heard or seen anything, and he denied that he had.  It didn't look like any of our planes, and I called the flight supervisor ~21:06 to ask about any planes on the radar, and he said they hadn't tracked anything. 

The grouping of the lights suggested either a chevron shape, or a formation that was very precisely close at such a high speed.  I will assume it was rather close to the ground, as I only saw it for a few seconds before it was gone over the dorms, and the lights were roughly the size of a child's size fast food drink lid held at arm's length, to my perception. (That's all I have nearby to compare it to, don't judge.)  I couldn't see any outline past the lights, only the haze of the low clouds fuzzing out the lights a good deal.  They moved uniformly for as long as I saw them, giving me the impression it was a single craft.  As this is an aeronautical school, there were at least several student pilots within a few miles, but the flight supervisor said no-one else had reported anything.

This event occurred at about 1:10 AM on March 14, 1997, about 18 miles southwest of Tucson, Arzona.  At that time, I was a 42 year old electronic engineer. who operated a small home business, doing contract jobs for various clients.  I had lived in Tucson for some time, and felt that the city was too noisy for me to concentrate on my work.  I wanted to live in a quiet rural area where I would not be disturbed, and in 1996 I purchased a house in a sparsely populated area southwest of town.

I had a neighbor across the road from me, and there was an unoccupied house furthur to the north.  My property extended about 100 feet from the front of the house, and then there was a barbed wire fence.  It had 5 wires, the top one being about 4 feet high.  It was usually quite dark at night out there, however I had installed some floodlights on the front of the house, which I could turn on if needed.

I went to bed around 10 PM, March 13, and was sleeping soundly when the event began.

I was awakened around 1:10 AM, March 14, by the sound of someone attempting to open the bedroom window, about 6 feet away from me.  The sound was like nails on a blackboard.  The window was on the front of the house, and consisted of double-pane glass with track-locks on it, and a set of blinds which were closed.  Although I could not see who was trying to get in, I had a profound feeling of being in danger... as if whoever was outside specifically intended to do something bad to me.  I've always had a good sensitivity to the feelings of people and animals, and I was confident that what I felt was genuine.

As quickly as I could, I rolled out of bed, away from the direction of the window, and grabbed a 12 gauge shotgun from the closet.  At this time my emotions changed from fear to intense anger and a strong determination to kill the attempted intruder, if he got in.  I pumped a shell into the chamber, which made an audible noise, then ran to the living room window, which was only about 10 feet from the bedroom window, also on the front of the house.  That was where the switch for the floodlights was located.

I hit the switch, and was totally shocked when I saw a creature, which was now moving away from the house towards the fence.  I got a pretty good look at the back of it, for about 5 seconds.  It was definitely not human.  It was about 6-7 feet tall and had a large head, similar in shape to a football helmet.  It was very thin and the arms were quite long.  It wasn't exactly running, but it was moving smoothly and very quickly.

It reached the fence in just a few seconds, and then, without slowing down, it jumped right over it, like a hurdle jumper in the Olympics, and kept on going.  It continued down to the wooded area where the unoccupied house was, and within about 30 seconds I saw a disk shaped object rise up from there, and move off towards the south.

It was about 30-40 feet in diameter and passed by the front of my house at a distance of about 130 feet, about 60-80 feet above the ground.  It had steady yellow-redish lights on the bottom of it and made no sound that I could hear.

I mentally collapsed into a state of total shock and an overwhelming feeling of fear.  All I could think of was what might happen if it came back.  I spent the rest of the night hiding behind a couch in the living room, clutching the shotgun.

When the sun began to come up, I started to come to my senses. I carefully went outside and looked around.  Everything seemed normal, except that by my bedroom window I found some footprints.  There hadn't been much rain and the ground was rather hard, but a few of the impressions were fairly clear.  The prints were about 10-11 inches in length, very thin, and with 3 large toes.

I decided to go to a hardware store and get some bolt locks to secure the doors.  This I did, and on the way back I stopped at a small cafe a few miles from my house, to pick up some coffee and breakfast.  I entered the cafe, ordered some food, and then noticed that a casual friend of mine was there.  He lived in a trailer a few miles to the south of me.  When I saw him I simply said ""Man, something really weird happened last night,"" and he replied, ""You're not kidding... a UFO came up the canyon"".

I was startled to hear that, and asked him, ""What time?"" and he replied, ""about a quarter past 1.""  When he said that, I panicked and left the cafe without even taking my coffee or food.  (Several months later I actually tried to find him, to ask him for more details, but I was told he had left the area back in March...immediately after the event had occurred.)   Anyway, I returned to the house, and installed the locks on the doors.  The following day I went into town and purchased a bunch of heavy plywood, and boarded up every window in the house.

I considered reporting the incident, but I was doing some electronic design work for the military, and I was afraid that I might be typed as a lunatic or a security risk and lose my clearance... and in addition, I simply had no desire to talk about it.","Electronic Engineer",1,1,"disk",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1997,1990,1,3,1,"Night","West",1,0,0,0,0

Sighting lasted from 9:30-9:48 pm (18-20 minutes)  Started out as a brighter than usual light that looked like a big bright star in the southeastern sky in North Minneapolis.  It was a clear night with stars visible and with few clouds in the night sky. It seemed like it (the light) was almost directly over the downtown Minneapolis area, it was a bright light somewhat at airplane altitude,that changed colors, or at least it seemed to, it was white and blue and green at times, it looked like it was constantly changing colors.  Was bigger than the common commercial drone since I was able to see it from north Minneapolis and it was about the size of a pea or smaller, so a pea would block it completely if held up at arms length.  It had many strange movements that caught my eye while I was outside picking up food.

 It stayed stationary and moved left to right across the sky very slowly. It then stopped moving and stayed stationary until it started moving slowly upwards while staying in the same place ascending towards a bunch of clouds in the upper layer of the sky.

The light stayed there for a long time just underneath the clouds. I had time to  go back inside my house and so I watched it from the window until it slowly went upwards again towards the layer of clouds which by that time the clouds had become thicker and had been moved by the wind towards the downtown area. So it basically disappeared into the clouds while slowly ascending towards what seemed to me upwards towards the stratosphere.There was no sound,I did see what I believe to be two helicopters or aircraft flying through the area further northeast of the object around the same time frame, they only had red lights not the usual green-go, white and red-stop lights that I'm used to seeing when other hospital helicopters fly by.

Date of sighting between 6/1965 ? 8/1965 around 5:15pm.  Sightings reported the next day between Colorado Springs to Cheyenne, Wyoming in newspapers.

Some things are true whether you believe them or not.  This is one of those stories, but it started off one day in Daniels Park on a beautiful sunny summer afternoon.  My boyfriend Larry and I had brought a picnic to the site as it was close to my home in Littleton, Colorado, looking forward to a scenic afternoon together.  From the park, you can see Pikes Peak in the South, Mt. Evans in the West, and Longs Peak in the North, but we had no idea the sight we were about to see and it wasn?t listed in any brochure that might have been available.

We had just finished the food we had brought with us, shared on a picnic table situated close to the edge of a small cliff that overlooked the Rocky Mountains.  We took the remnants of our food to Larry?s car, placed what remained in the truck and meandered over to a tree that stood in front of the cliff.  There was a valley beyond the tree and beyond that valley were the Rocky Mountains.  Larry stood on one side of the tree, and I on the other side in awe of the sights before us.  We didn?t say a word, just looked at the view enjoying the pristine air, the trees below in the valley and the Rocky Mountain range, so close we could see the green of the pine trees.

We must have been standing there for several minutes not saying a word when something came into view that startled both of us.  As we watched, three objects came flying over the trees at great speed and so close they should have touched them.  They quickly dipped down into the valley and hovered over the ground.  I wasn?t sure if I should say something because once those words left my lips I was sure Larry would think I?d gone mad, but discretion was not something that was needed at that moment.

And so the words came out of my mouth, ?Larry do you see what I see??  Larry being as stunned as I was said, ?What is it you?re seeing??  Now the cat was out of the bag and it was time to say what I was seeing.

?That looks like flying saucers to me.  What do you see??  At this point I felt a sense of relief flowing over Larry, although neither of us moved an inch from our positions.  ?That?s what it looks like to me.?  Larry stated still in awe at what was transpiring before us.  I could hear it in his voice.

And so we stood there watching three flying saucers as they flew halfway between us and the Rocky Mountains and then stopped in midair.  A rational moment was somehow needed, so I asked Larry if he thought they were government vehicles, did he see any numbers on them.  Of course no was the answer that came back from Larry which agreed with what I could see from my location.

What followed was a four minute conversation between Larry and I trying to make sense of what was happening.  By now one of the flying saucers had gone down to the ground and the other two hovered over it.  As we were trying to figure out what they were doing one of us moved but I?m not sure which one.  I was too absorbed watching those saucers.  The one on the ground had about a three second delay and then flew up to the other two saucers.  By now my mouth was hanging open as one of the saucers started flying toward us.  My mouth flew shut as I yelled to Larry we had to get out of there.

We ran to his car as fast as our legs could carry us, arriving at the car as Larry dropped the car keys in his haste to open the door.  ?Hurry Larry, it?s almost here.?, as panic took over and all rational thoughts flew out of my head.   Larry backed up the car and started moving forward toward the road that had brought us to this spot just as the saucer started hovering over our car.

Just as a child is convinced sheets can protect them at night from scary sounds in the middle of the night, I calmed down surrounded by the safety of our car and looked up at the saucer hovering over us.    I looked at the size of the saucer, it was about 15 or 20 feet across, as far as I could tell from that location, and the bottom of it was a smooth looking type of metal without any rivets or seams of any kind.   There was no propeller and no dust flying around us.  It seemed as if the saucer was flying by some unseen force as my eyes gradually went up to the top of the saucer base.  There were clear looking windows in a circle above the base and I held my breath as I looked up in hopes of seeing what was driving this vehicle.  When I looked into the windows, all I could see was the top of the ceiling.

It was bright and sunny when I looked up and just as suddenly it was almost dark outside with me not wondering why there had been such a sudden change in the light.  Larry and I drove off into the now dimming light as the flying saucer returned to the other two saucers and flew back over the Rocky Mountains.

I was so excited on the drive home telling Larry we needed to report this incident.  We had seen this in broad daylight, we hadn?t been drinking anything alcoholic and both of us witnessed this event together.  He turned, looked at me with his face screwed up a bit and said he?d lose his job with the Air Force if he reported what we had seen as he was in training at Lowry Air Force Base.     He made me promise I wouldn?t tell anyone, not even my parents as he dropped me off at my home that evening.

I would have thought that would have been the end of our adventure, but I was surprised it wasn?t over yet.  A week went by and I was sitting in the shade of my home in the cool grass when a black car came driving up and parked in front of my house.  No one was home at that time; as a matter of fact no one was on the street at that time other than me and this black car.  I was startled to see two men come out of the vehicle.  I was startled because they both had black suits on despite the fact that it was so hot that morning.  Who?d wear black suits in this weather was my only thought as one of them approached me and the other one stayed by the car.

It?s difficult remembering that conversation other than a few significant items that have stayed in my head and will forever remain there.  He talked about what I had seen that day at Daniels Park, said that if I ever told anyone about what I?d seen my father would lose his job at Martin Marietta and they would make sure he?d not be employed again.  He was working on the Titan Missile among others things at the time.  Who were these people, how did they know my father worked for Martin Marietta and how did they know I was there that day?  I was in Larry?s car, not mine.  I thought it was silly threatening me when I had told Larry I wouldn?t say anything, but I guess they hadn?t talked to Larry.  I got a hold of Larry on the phone later in the day and was met with another surprise.

Larry told me they had been to see him and now he could never see me again.   I asked him over and over what they had said to him but he refused to tell me.  He just kept saying he?d lose his job with the Air Force if he ever saw me again.  I hung up the telephone puzzled and sad.  I had lost someone who I found to be very special to me and all because I?d seen some flying saucers in the summer of 1965.

I didn?t tell anyone what I had seen that day so long ago in Daniels Park for concern my father would lose his job with Martin Marietta, but I would have been released from that when he died.  I still kept this story quiet because of other factors that had come into play including my job with the government.

My Husband and I were going to get some dinner about 8:30 pm on March 1st, it had just gotten dark, as we went down the road we stay on we saw a very bright light with a small red light on the side of it down toward the river, we could not tell if the small light was attached to the large light or not .

We thought it was a helicopter cause we live near an air force base, as we continued to town we watched the bright light and the little red light moving toward us,it seem to be moving just not very fast, as we traveled closer to town we came to a business site that has a large drive way just off the road and we stopped to see if we could tell just what it was.  

By this time the large bright light and little red light had gotten closer to us . It was not very high in the air that's why we thought it was a helicopter.  

We stopped and rolled down our windows to hear if there was any  helicopter sounds because we still thought it was a helicopter, but we could not hear any noise of a helicopter at all so I turn the truck off and listen again no noise, by this time the craft was even closer , but when the truck head lights went out, the large bright light on the craft went out too, and then we saw 3 sets of small red lights off set from each other.  We then got out of the truck and stood in front of the truck, watching and listen to see if we could tell what it was, just then it started to turn away from us still moving very slow and with out any noise at all.

One set of red lights was in front, one set in the middle just a little lower than the others  and the other set was up toward what look like the back of the craft but we could not make out the body of the craft, the red lights moved together and appeared to be together.  We watched it as it went out of our sight, we just looked at each other and got back in the truck and were talking about what we thought it could have been since it we knew it was not a helicopter ,we went and got our food.

As we were heading home , we had to stop at the stop light on 70 hwy and a police car pulled up behind us when the stop light changed we went across 70 hwy the police car turned on its lights and flew around us really fast and went in the same directions as the craft did.  Not sure if someone had reported it to the police or not .","homemaker",2,3,"circle",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2016,2010,1,3,20,"Evening","South",1,0,0,1,0

So a friend of mine with the name of ((girl's name deleted)) and myself were travelling from NJ to DE for a wedding reception for one of her family members next day.  I cannot remember which road we were taking as she was driving but it was one of the main ones as I remember paying toll shortly after.  I believe it had 9 in the number so it was on 495 or 295, but I remember it wasn't 95.

So there she was driving and it was past 2:30 am and I reclined the passenger seat and I was trying to get some sleep.  Then she pokes me to wake me up saying:  ""((male name deleted)) wake up there is a UFO next to the car!"" and she had a nervous laughter to her voice and she said that twice.  Now my first impression was that she just wanted to wake me up so I can keep her company so I pretended I was fast asleep till the second poke.

I turn to her (as I was sleeping facing my door) and I ask her ok where is it?  Now she used to make fun of my belief in UFOs, so I couldn't have taken anything coming from her about that matter seriously.

She points to some lights outside her window that seemed a few miles away at least. They appeared to be a row of round white lights at least 6-7, reminded me of portholes  of a ship with lights shining from inside now that I think about it.  Any ways these lights were many feet above the ground but it's so hard to tell how far they were, we were going through a flat area with no street lights or houses, possibly fields.  I automatically looked for scientific explanation for what we were looking at, I said may be it's a construction tool/crane of some sort or row of lights on a building.

But we continued to drive further and we DID NOT leave the lights behind which can only mean they were not stationary and keeping pace with our speed!  I asked her how long has it been since she first saw the lights and she said a few minutes!  I asked her to stop the car and the lights may have just stopped if they were following us.  So now I see the lights stationary/hovering in the air with absolutely no sound and I had this feeling that something intelligent was looking at me while I was looking at it/them.  Few seconds after, the row of lights moved together (which confirmed to me that they were attached to the same object and not individual) from being horizontal to being suspended in the air at about 20 degrees!  The craziest thing I have seen is as it started to tilt from flat to 20 degrees, it ""wobbled"" like it was in water not in air!  Reminds me if you have a bathtub of water and gently drop a plate how it will land at the bottom.  It was bigger than  plane f! or sure but I could not confirm what it looked like, I thought I could see a black silhouette of the body which I thought it was flat but I am not 100% sure.  It was dark with no lights around but these.

I had the hairs on my body stand on end and it then hit me that that WAS NOT EARTHLY!  It immediately reminded me of the Phoenix lights which I saw briefly in 1997 on the news with the volume down and never got the whole scoop on it.  I cannot explain to you how it just hit me that I am witnessing something out of this world and how different it was between believing and witnessing!  I had a 35mm camera behind my feet as we wanted to take pictures next day at the reception and I frantically was looking for it under the mess of the empty fast food wrappers and I was about ready to leave the car to take a snap (I thought I will make history and all) she grabs my left arm and said:  ""They will take you with them!"" and until this day I cannot believe what I said in response.. ""I want to go with them!"".

Whomever is reading this, at that particular moment I was ready to leave EVERYTHING and EVERYONE on earth to experience for myself that we are not alone, even if I couldn't come back EVER! Any ways I took note of the time on the dashboard which was 2:50 am.

I get out of the car go around the back, got the camera ready and this thing tilts and wobbles again just like it did before so now it's at 45 degrees suspended in the air with no sound.  And then.. NOTHING!  It just disappeared!  I thought I may have missed it take off but I am very positive that it just was no longer there!  It was like when you turn off the lights in a room kind of effect!  So here I am on the side of the highway with a camera loaded with film, mouth wide open and looking at nothing!  I went back to the car and looked at the time and there was none missing, we drove further down hoping to find it again if it has just moved further down but there was nothing!  We paid toll and kept on going but there was nothing.

Next day, we told her parents and they kinda chuckled, but didn't call us crazy.  It's funny that there is a ufo shaped house in DE we used to often pass and I wonder what's the story behind that?  I am willing to undergo any kind of test to the truth of my encounter and I was not under the influence of any mind altering substance.

Aug 18th, 2014.  3:50 pm.  I had Just Arrived home from a day of wrenching at the speed shop i was working at in Ferrisburgh, VT.   I am a fabricator and performance mechanic by trade.  Motorsports is my life.                  

I washed up, and then proceeded to make some food.   Finishing that up I thought to myself ?it?s a super nice afternoon.  Not hot, not humid, and super clear and dry.?   You would be able to see the Milky Way belt later that night from my porch and driveway.  So I thought, ?I?m going to enjoy my front porch and sit out and watch the night sky for a few hours as it gets dark.

Well, only about 20min later, while sitting on my porch.  A huge caravan of Town police, State police, SWAT, FBI, Military and unmarked federal vehicles barreled down South Main Street going east towards Duxbury.  it was 10-12 vehicles at emergency operational speed all within a ? a car length of each other doing 60mph in a 25mph zone.  This kind of thing never happens here.  So I knew something big was going on.    

I ran inside and started looking online for local news channels or web sites that might be covering what was up.  Sure enough, just under a mile away WCAX was covering a story ?State police had received a call to check on Paul Sweetser, 58, Monday 18th.  Family members had called police because Sweetser was threatening to harm himself.?  

So at this point I went back outside to the sound and sight of a military Helicopter flying through the green mountain range over Waterbury, over route 89 and over my house going South towards Sweetser's house.  

So, I went to the end of my parking lot where the trees open up and witnessed the Heli slow down, and drop a bit in altitude and start circling around the general neighborhood where the report was coming from.  They stayed at about 1000-1500ft in elevation.  But then at about 7:30-9:45pm, they started circling a much larger area than the house in question on that street, and they were frequently rotating Helicopters in and out for refueling.  I saw 5 or 6 different helicopters in the sky that night in the span of 5hrs doing the same circular patrol while spot lighting large areas of trees and woods around the neighborhood.     Spotlighting the woods.  Not even the house in question.

So now it?s just after 9:50pm I have been watching the ground and aerial activity around and over this neighborhood for over 5 hrs now.   Mesmerized but what I was Witnessing.      Basically a huge military presence on the road ways, and aerial activity that the state police were not accountable for.  That also went un mentioned in any kind of official report of the incident by the state or the papers.

This is when I witnessed the UFO.  It was now 9:56.  I?ll never forget the time.

the last military chopper in the air to circle the neighborhood had just turned out of the patrol loop and gone back over the green mountain range towards Fort Ethan Allen.     When I saw the impossible.

I?ve seen shooting stars, I've seen super sonic jets brake the sound barrier, I?ve seen space shuttles float by in orbit,  I?ve seen the international space station float on by, and I?ve seen meteors & meteorites,  I've flown drones and seen military drones be flown.

This was none of the above.

About a ? mile west of the Sweetser?s house.  Up on the ridge that parallels the west side of that neighborhood.   A ball or orb of brilliant blue/white light, very much the same color as a plasma arc from a plasma cutter or torch, glowed blue/white at the center and glowed a intense white on the edges, from what looked like heat dispersion.  It was low in the trees and then proceeded to gain a little elevation at about 10-15mph, then eventually appearing fully visible above the tallest spruce pines at the top of the ridge.  It then gained an additional 500ft in elevation above the ridge and stopped.  

It sat there hovering for 5-6 seconds and then proceeded to move due East at approx. 5-10mph. right around half the speed it had been traveling up out of the trees with, right towards Sweetser?s house, it then went right over top of the house at the same elevation approx. 500ft, when It frantically and instantly changed direction and speed.  But not in a way I've ever witne! ssed.

See below.

Imagine if yoou will, a potentiometer that you could rotate left or right. that would supply input to a mechanical arm that holds a pen on paper.   Move the knob left and the pen moves up as the paper goes by.  Move the potentiometer right, and the pen moves down as the paper goes by, it would make a smooth wavy line left to right due to a more smooth analog input  Now imagine a 3-way switch controlling the pen.    Up, on the switch would move the pen up.  Center position of the switch would be earth, and down with the switch, would move it down.   Creating a squarer sine wave type line.   Not totally square corners or perfectly vertical lines would be produced, but I think it?s a close enough example to relate the difference in visual outcome to the difference in input  This UFO changed Direction like the square sine wave on the right And then instantly accelerated like I?ve never seen anything accelerate before.

First It made the instant turn at 500ft, and then went into what looked like an inter-planetary trajectory or an interstellar one.  It looked to progressively get smaller relative to the rate it was moving, but more importantly, it instantly got up to speed after it changed direction @ 500ft, and continued at that speed until it disappeared from view.   It looked like the size of a star a few million light years away when it disappeared from view I still to this day have trouble contemplating the physics of what I saw.  It made absolutely no sense.

After this was witnessed I felt very taken back, receded, an ominous feel was in the air.

So I felt the need to drive over to the neighborhood where this all happened, so as to drive by the house and see if some state police where still there, and maybe spot one of the unmarked FBI or military vehicles not near that property. Or ones that hadn?t been reported by WCAX.

So I went by.  A few state troopers were still there. But that was it.             So at that point I now wanted to get as close as I could to the launch location as possible.  And I thought the use of the big field between Sweetser?s house and the mtn ridge where the UFO took off from would be the best bet.     So Remember this was a crystal clear, dry, Aug night.   And up here in VT especially in the valley I live in. If it?s hot and humid during the day, clouds will settle into the valleys at night   You?ll wake up to heavy fog in the A.M. only to realize that a few hours later, it?s all evaporated and actually a blue bird day without a cloud in the sky.   The reason I mentioned this is because That field at 11:12 on a clear, clear, clear, very dry night was full of humidity & precipitation. but only hovering about 12-24? off the surface of the grass.    Very, very weird atmospheric conditions close by this aerial anomaly.

 P.S.  Later that week the local Sunday paper stated that he had been talking crazy, yelling gibberish, acting erratically, and threatening to take his own life.

I am a lifelong skywatcher and have seen many ufos.  This event was unique in that the object metamorphosed.  It happened as follows:  After a long day of work I accompanied my kids to the community pool at 4:00 pm.  While the kids were swimming I was laying on my back in the grass.  After a few minutes I observed what looked like a 6 inch soap bubble a hundred feet or so off the ground.  

After twenty seconds the object transformed into what looked like a small jet at 10,000 feet more or less.  After fifteen seconds the object became a white dot that faded into the blue sky.  The trajectory of the object was a strait line until it disappeared.  The direction of the object was southerly, toward Point Mugu, which is an area having multiple sightings per month seemingly exiting and entering the Pacific Ocean.  

Common thought relates these sightings to the mysterious booming sounds heard centered around Alhambra (LA).  It is hypothesized that an undersurface excavation is occurring under Los Angeles.  Food for thought?

Huge falling fireball.  This was a significant meteor across my back field.  Only 10 degrees high - about 135 degrees falling.  I was facing NE 36 degrees.  Meteor flew in from right to left.  

Not even 5 minutes later in my back field, I saw three huge round white lights flash for 30 seconds.  It was significant light- like I was at a concerts from 100 yards away.  Perhaps the size of a porthole from that distance.I have three acres of forest in my backyard that slopes downhill.  The lights were mid tree level at least 50 feet high.  5 minutes or 10 minutes passed and they were followed by orange paneled lights also significant is size, but a dull color. Same exact spot as the white lights.  Double layered 4 across in square sections.  I opened my window and kept staring.  Now consecutive purple flashes in the sky where the fireball had last been seen.  THEN we heard the noises on the ground.  Deep grumbles like you'd hear in your abdomen of the D tone and prolonged.  We have raccoons, porcupines, and a healthy coyote population. I know what those all sound like and this was NOT it. Coyote's were extremely quiet whereas normally I hear them every night hunting. I even left food out for our raccoon friend (he likes my cats food) and it wasn't eaten the next day. THEN... an hour had gone by so around midnight we started to have a search light in my bedroom window.  This one was round and significantly smaller - something you might except to see on a helicopter only there was no sound associated with flying aircraft.  First it was just flashing through the trees then, it came in and focused right on my partner and me.  I've never been so scared in my life!  Shaking in my boots.  What a night.","marketing and farming",2,3,"sphere",0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2016,2010,4,10,0,"Night","Northeast",1,0,0,0,0

I was driving in Anderson Township at twilight to pick up Chinese food on Ohio Pike.  I was alone in the car when I noticed a very bright, low hovering light in the western sky toward the downtown Cincinnati direction.  It was way too low on the horizon to be a star or planet.  

I pulled over in the car and parked where I could have nearby points of reference to see if this object was moving at all. It was not.  There were no flashing lights, just a brilliantly bright slightly flickering light.  

When viewed through a very low power set of bird watching binocs it took on a 3 pointed shine shape.  

I drove to another location a few miles away and over the course of this time it never moved or changed.

In the early seventies my family moved into a run down Civil War mansion in Hancock, Maryland. It was on the C&O Railroad with the C&O canal, tow path and Potomac river within a short walk.  It was an amazing place to spend many years as a child.  It was surrounded by orchards and the Tow Path from Washington, D.C., to the Paw Paw Tunnel was our personal playground.

There were five children and two grown ups that lived together. Every child had their own room in this 31 room mansion.  All the children with rooms on the east side of the house saw a cigar shaped craft one night hover over an old ornamental fountain in the yard and suck water from it.  The next morning at the breakfast table they all drew pictures of the craft.  It was cigar shaped with orange windows in it.

That morning the headline in the local news paper reported many people seeing strange lights above Lovers Leap which was a historical sight directly across the Potomac from the mansion in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia.

We all had chores and that night mine was to feed the cats out on the patio.  The doors that lead out to the patio were french doors with a broken door nob.  If the door latched behind you, you would need to use a near by screw driver to open it.  It was a large screened in patio with terracotta tile floors.  We were hippies and had stuff all over the place including a mini fridge in one of the corners.  I went out to feed the cats and on my way back to the door I felt terror up my back.  I turned around to see a small being standing next to the minifridge with a look of fear on her face.  She was crouched with her hands clasped in front of her torso.  I knew she was a she.  And I knew she was as afraid as I was, like she was caught.  She was glowing amber, stood no taller than the mini fridge and looked exactly like the grays from Close and Encounters of the Third Kind but was much shorter and glowing amber. I was stunned and full of terror.  With container of cat food in one hand I pushed on the latched french door to run inside.  Without considering it had latched shut my hand went through the window as the door slammed open.  I skidded along the floor and ended up in a small pile of glass and dry cat food.  In the chaos I had sliced the palm of my right hand on the broken window and was bleeding pretty bad.

No one believed me.  Everyone thought I was copying the other children who saw the craft.

I hope that little biological entity found her way home.  The scar on my right palm is my proof of that experience.  This experience opened me to a life spent researching and reading about UFO's and ancient mysteries.

Fireball might not be the best description - more like a bright white comet-shaped object (short tail) that seemed to float in the air as it moved at a good clip.  No sound and no contrail.  I observed it out of my right view as I looked south (on my way to picking up Chinese food).  I had seen similar objects the day before (November 12 - Bethesda, MD report) and on November 5 (Bethesda, MD report) and October 15 (Kensington, MD - report not filed).  The white object was high in the sky - no clouds were present.  It was moving from right to left (West to East).  Wheaton, Maryland, is about 4 miles directly north of Washington, DC, and the airspace is pretty restricted.  The object veered - or more like pivoted - southward, as if heading toward DC/Virginia.  It then completely dissipated.  It looked like it vaporized.  Not fading slowly from view, but gone.  I took a video of the incident.

 The other times I saw these objects, there were either three or four together, maybe a few miles apart from each other or closer.  They may be in one field of view - kind of close but distant from each other.  It's weird - you see just one, and then there will be three or four in view.  These appear to be the same things described in the Philadelphia, PA  November 5, 2016 17:15 report of four cigar-shaped objects.  My report of November 5 was from an hour later (DC is south of Philly and the things were traveling southwesterly when I saw them).

Here are their characteristics from my four sightings: no sound; very high; very large; ""soft"" (not hard outlines); bright white - likely reflecting the sun; no contrail or vapor trail; appear in groups (three or four) sometimes (first one and then the others); not in same ""space"" as other aircraft in the area; looks like a slant sometimes; flies slanted; changes directions with pivots and not regular turns; seem to float, but also move fast - alternately and at the same time; no discernible body; tail is short at times and longer at other times, likely due to perspective as it rotates or moves from you; tail can appear to be a sideways V when viewed from one angle and straight - like a slant - when viewed from another; does not have lights (as if the objects would not be seen at night); they are being flown, not drifting - movement is purposeful; at least one seemed to disappear (vaporize like a puff either through rapid acceleration or otherwise); my vi! ewings were in late afternoon, early twilight (coincidence?).

It was the night of Friday, Sep 2, 2016.  After a long day of work, I retired to my bed and ready to sleep.  I also had a lunch meet-up appointment with my buddy on the next day so I went to bed by midnight, which was earlier than my usual Friday night sleep time.

Perhaps sometime at 1 or 2 am, I was awake but still in my bed.  There was a bright white light emitting from my 4 o'clock (my head is at 12 o'clock position as a reference).  The light came from a white ball of light. It was so bright that my eyes were filled with tears and I had to turn my head slightly to the left to avoid it.  The light was so white and bright like it was coming from either a high power flood light or the sun.  It must be noted that although the washroom light was on during the night and it was in the vicinity of my bed, it was a energy saving light bulb and its colour was yellowish dim.

I remember that right before I turned my head, there was a tingling sensation in my breathing tube traveling upward between my collar bone to my jaw.  It was itching and I remember that I brushed my neck with both hands downward.

I don't remember seeing any entities or physical contacts during the entire event and I was laid down on my bed the entire time;  I also dont remember if my lower body was immobile.

The next day, I got up with the sense of a bit restless but didnt give much thought. My friend later noticed that I was behaving a little bit agitated while I was looking for a parking spot at mall. It could be the result of the event or perhaps it was stress related.

But our lunch was the last meat I have eaten for the past three months. Somehow that encounter changed my diet habit and I dont find red meat and chicken appetizing anymore.  My diet has become almost vegetarian.  I do eat fish and seafood from time to time, but I know I can also live without them.  My weight dropped and I felt more healthy and my brain more active for all these months.

What really blew my mind was a physical evidence that I cannot simply treat this as a dream or human psychological response to stress.  This event had left a physical mark on my chest.  I found it very similar to the scoop mark left on some of the abductees' bodies.  It has been three months since the event and that mark still remains in its original shape and colour.  There is no other physical symptoms, pain or itching coming from it.  Of course, it wasnt there before and no scratch cannot heal in three months.

I don't sense it was a malevolent encounter and I have not had another one since then, or at least any that I can remember.",NA,1,1,"sphere",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2016,2010,3,9,0,"Night",NA,1,0,0,0,0

Myself and my father, I was 8yrs old he was 38yrs old, the year was 1979.

The small hamlet of East Orange, VT.  Was the location that the event was witnessed.

The time was approximately between 1am-2am, early on a Saturday, opening day of deer season (rifle).

We had departed from our home in Chelmsford, MA, earlier in the evening, around 9pm.   This was more or less an annual event for us.  We would leave after my father returned from his plumbing job on Friday night, this time of year was the opening of hunting season in Vermont and we?d want to be ready to go for opening morning at sunrise the next morning.

We arrived in the village of East Orange, VT, sometime around 1am.  Of note we passed the home of a local who was having a loud party often a normal occurrence during the excitement of hunting season.  Our property and trailer are about ? of mile outside of the village, but because of the terrain, we can?t see the village from our property (about 1500ft above sea level).  Instead we have a beautiful view of the distant White Mountains in New Hampshire.

As was my father?s habit, he decided to make pit-stop at another hunting camp, even before we went to our trailer.  The camp was call Heartbreak and was the haunt of some of his buddies from back home where he grew up in Lowell, MA.  Over the years, I would come to understand that the pull of catching up and throwing a few back with one's buddies has a strong macho pull, especially in times before constant cell and email contact, although these were some of his best and longest held friends he had gone several months since last seeing them.  

Heartbreak was only about a ? mile from our trailer and as we drove up the road to Heartbreak we have always been able to look across the valley (about 300 yards as the crow flies) and see our little red trailer.   As it happened on this night the all that was visible was the barren scar of the ?flat spot? that we had recently carved out of the side of the mountain just above (30 feet) where our trailer sits, this flat spot was cut out! in the preparation for us to start to construct our ?mountain house? the following spring , it would be a Swiss chalet, but for now it was a large 150 x 75 flat open area, a strange site on such a mountains topography.

Upon arrival at Heartbreak, we were surprised to find all was quiet and still at this normally ruckus hunting camp.  Although close in association to those within, my father thought it was respectful to leave the inhabitants in peace and that maybe we, too, should finally head to our trailer and get some sleep as for as too the alarm clock would ring and we?d be amongst the early morning hunters.  As we descended town the same road we had ascended only minutes earlier, our attention was taken buy an unexpected site.

Across the valley we now see the lights of our trailer blazing, to me this was a very surprising sight, I had no idea who or why our trailer has come to life.  It is mid-November and the trailer has been dormant since the summer season ended after Labor Day weekend.  As we paused and looked across the valley at the now sparkling lights on an otherwise dark foreboding mountain, I asked my father who is at our trailer.  My father, not the leased alarmed, quickly realized that the unknown occupant could be none other than Uncle Eddie, uncle Eddie had for years been a on again off again regular during hunting season.  He never actually hunted but would go camping, by camping I mean he?d visit camp after camp and  camp, all the while careful not to? bruise the booze? with any food, his only substance would be Pepsi and an assortment of alcohols for the weekend.  I was disappointed at this turn of events, as a young boy I idolized my father and relished our alone time together.  My father was well liked and loved by almost everyone thought out his life and more so than ever in these early days I had to compete more often than not for my father?s time.  Seeing my disappointment at this loved but unwelcomed (at least to me) guest my father consoled me by reminding me we would soon be in the woods hunting, just the two of use and that ?Eddie? had always been fun and good humored and only added to the fabric of a good hunting camp.

After our brief discussion regarding Uncle Eddie, we proceeded down the road, the distance was only about another 100 yards to the end of the road where it met East Orange Road (Heartbreak was and still is at the end of Notch End Road).  At the end of the Notch End Road we had to simple make a right turn and our road (driveway) would be a switch back on the right, maybe ? mile up.  At the time it was simple ?our road?, since it has been named in honor of the farm from which much of the surrounding camps had acquired their land from Delmar Hutchinson, the driveway is now Hutchinson Way.

My father for some reason paused at the bottom of the road and pondered if he wanted to in fact head to the trailer.  He to my surprise decided to take a left and head back to the village where the local party was in full swing.  I don?t know if he thought that maybe some of his buddies were there?  Or did he just want to drop in.  As Flatlanders (people from the lower part of New England, we were from Mass, some would simple call us Massholes) we were somewhat shunned, maybe a type of modern ?carpetbagger? but my father being a down to earth plumber and having over the previous 10years installed a number of ?in-door plumbing? was more or less accepted, for whatever the reason it was only a short ride, maybe ? mile and to our surprise the ruckus party had all but completely dissipated, the ?party house? was dead quiet, no lights, no activity, nothing,  both of us were more than surprised at this turn of events.  It had only been maybe 10 minutes since we passed by this very ! same house with half a dozen pickup trucks and whooping and hollering.   With no options left my father begrudgingly headed for the trailer.

Upon our arrival at the trailer, or shall I say ?almost? arrival.   The fall rains had taken a tremendous toll on last of our driveway.  The last part of our driveway was a sharp left turn up a rocky hill, maybe only 50 yards, but steep and even in the best of conditions a challenged, never mind that we were in his work van (if I remember it was a Ford E350, not a 100% on that, but surely a van), so which was pretty common we ended up walking the last 30yards to the trailer up the hill.

The trailer was some model that was old when I was young, maybe from the 1950?s I can?t be sure, but it was our beloved weekend get-a-way.   My father upon reaching the trailer when to the power box on the back of the trailer and switch the power main on,  tomorrow he?d fire up the water heater and prime the pump, but for tonight we?d go with the electric heat and many blankets as November in Vermont can be cold very cold.   We unlocked and removed the padlock from the trailer door, and swept aside the cobwebs.  The trailer always had a stale smell when we would arrive for the weekend, but soon with the burps and farts of hunting camp we would long wish for that staleness again.   I found my bunk in the rear of the trailer and my father took his familiar position at the head of the trailer on the couch (the bunks did not offer much comfort for a large adult man, my father stood at 6? and maybe 240-250lbs).

Come the early morning the weekend went as expected, we didn?t shoot a deer, in reality in all of our years hunting (lasting until the early 2000?s) we only got one deer , it was always about a father and son spending quality time with each other.    This weekend like many others ended with no spent rounds and we closed up Sunday afternoon as the winter sun slid behind the mountain in early afternoon we headed home, empty handed but fully satisfied with our time together.   The ride home usually about 3hrs saw nothing out of the ordinary.    Arriving home and dangerously close to my bed time I exchanged a loving hug with my mother and held off with an recanting of our weekend till the following day.

Arriving home from school about 330pm Monday afternoon I walked into the kitchen to find my mother and father sitting at the kitchen table.  As I stepped into the room my father glanced in my direction stood up and walked into the other room.   My mother instructed me sit down with her at the table.  My mind raced with all the mischief that my nickname Ricky the wreaker earned me, nothing that would rise to this level of interrogation came to mind.        My mother in a calm voice began questioning me in a most impressive Socratic manner.   She wanted me to talk her through the details of our hunting trip, starting when we left Chelmsford and ending when we returned.    As I weaved through the narrative of the weekend I came upon the part of seeing the trailer lights a blaze and the discussion with my father about Uncle Eddie?s unexpected visit?.. It was then that it occurred to me that there never was any Uncle Eddie,  that the trailer lights could not have been ?ablaze?, t! hat something else was there, something else was present.     She asked me to describe what the trailer look like with these lights on, I said ?a passenger train at night,? several windows all lit up.  At this my mother called in my father, she indicated that our stories match exactly even down to our description of the ?object? we had seen , then she dropped a bombshell and confirmed a thought that was slowly formulating with in me, she said in a most excited declaration ? You?ve seen a UFO!!?   It turned out that Sunday night as my mother and father discussed the weekend she mentioned that she had visited with Eddie and Aunt Flora, it was when my father hear this that he recalled the pause and discussion with me regarding the visiting Uncle Eddie, who actually never visited and was in Massachusetts the entire weekend.   My mother always the sharp pencil devised the interrogation the next day in large part to assuage her own skepticism.

The obvious implication in this account should be obvious, but here are my major conclusion points.

1.	Uncle Eddie never actually came to Vermont, but yet we clearly saw a significant non-natural object on the side of the mountain.  The only man made object was our trailer.

2.	There is no evidence but I surmise that the ?flat spot we had cleared for the Chalet construction in the spring of 1980 was the likely landing spot for this UFO.? 3.	We feel there was a time issue, we found it unusual that the ?local party? disappeared so quickly, although not itself much, taken in the totality of the evening it is suspicious.

4.	The trailer driveway wasn?t accessible via vehicle, we could only get within 30yards, and the Flat spot was another 75yards up a steep unimproved driveway further up. This eliminates the possibility that we saw a bus or some other man made vehicle.

 Ok, well that is pretty much it.  In the decades since I?ve often talked with my father about that night, we needed to remind each other from time to time that what we saw really happened.  A few years back I put an idea to him that maybe when we got to the bottom of Notch End Road, that maybe we turned right after all, that we came upon whatever was there at the trailer, he would just nod and same maybe.   Well that?s it, do with this as you please.","former Military / Sales Executive",2,1,"cigar",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1979,1970,4,11,1,"Night","Northeast",1,0,0,0,0

The whole time the crafts were just sitting there and it almost seemed like they were spectating us.  We all went to bed thinking it was just military aircrafts. but here is where it gets interesting....one us (which was a teen girl) said she woke up and heard a rumbling sound in our backyard...she said that she looked out the window and stunned to see little eyes staring at her (directly at her).  she also said that that she saw an aircraft but it was very small.  It was only about 10 by 4 craft.  She ran to her bed and went under her covers and stayed there in till dawn.  She didn't sleep at all that night and said in the morning what she saw.  we went outside and we were shocked to see a lining of a large circle in the dirt.  In till then we all think it was maybe a UFO.  so that is why we came to you guys.  

Please email me back as soon as you guys can, so i can and my family figure this mystery out.  There is much more details to tell.

I was at a friend's house sitting on his front porch busy street busy area.  Talking about random stuff video games, etc..  He was like hey look at that, I'm like what ... look right there he pointed out a weird flashing object kind of strobish and similar to a plane flash but much brighter.  I said that's a plane he said no look how it's moving.  From where we were sitting he had a telephone pole to our right on an angle so we eyed it up with the pole to see which way it's moving if it even is moving and sure enough a couple of seconds after we did that it started moving.

In between the bright flashes, within a mili second of each one, we saw it in one spot then wam it was at least 1,000 yards (from our eyes, could be miles in the sky) but away from its original position.  We had a hard time keeping up with it in between flashes and moving irradic from left to right up And down.  Nothing that a plane helicopter or drone in today's world that's known to the public can move with such speed and agility.  Literally between its flashes, which was absolutely in under a second, it was in a totally different spot far away from the last position.  We watched do this for at least 15-20 minutes moving around.  Then it started moving a little farther away from us south east direction but still very visible with the flashes so bright.  But now it would flash then go dark completely no lights and show up in a totally different spot then it was like before.  We knew by then it wasn't a normal  plane especially because there are a bunch of planes flying in the sky and you see their regular flashes .

So we were asking ourselves how do these planes not see see this and move out the way or change course, but the way this thing was moving, it couldn't be near them at the speed in which it moved.  Then, after a minute or so of it going dark, a flashing, then dark again, moving to different spots.  It started flashing and rising up and just hovered while flashing.  Then lit up solid blue or white kind of like a floodlight, but nothing projecting down like you see with other common flood lights or search lights on commercial equipment, it just lit up whatever this thing was.  And for the way it reflected off the object it had to be a light colored object (white light with grey object projects a blueish color).

It was fully lit up for about a good 25 seconds went completely dark again then within a mili second we saw the flash of it farther away from where it was lit up which is farther away from where we were.  So more south central south east .  The only thing out that way that it could be as high as it was a project that bright of a light is fort dix combined base  no other airports or private places for such a thing in that direction then fort dix joint base. And in that direction depending on which part of the base is a given 30 to 80 miles away from us.  So that thing was bright .

After it headed farther away and disappeared me and my friend went to go get food took about 10 minutes or a little over got back to his house sat on the porch ate an we were still talking about it we never seen anything like it definitely unexplainable when all of sudden we saw it again back in the same area where it was before moving all over and flashing but did not light up solid or hover.  Just kept flashing then went dark and it was gone.  We sat outside for another 20 minutes looking at the sky, never saw it again or anything like it, just saw your normal plane passing by .

It was truly amazing how it moved liked that in a blink of an eye.  A night to remember never saw anything like this here before hopefully someone else saw this too and didn't blow it off as a plane it was anything, but I know the area very well and seen everything from regular helicopters to police helis, blackhawks  An your military crafts fly by all the time with lights on and off day and night  just as common as your regular plane and you can hear these far away aswell as a very lit up landscape from homes ect so to be that bright to outshine everything else wow .  . This thing had no sound and moved like no other craft known to the public could truly remarkable experience I will never forget.

So back in August of 1995, I had decided it was due time to leave the east coast.  At 23 years old I had grown up in Virginia my whole life and my soul just knew there was much more to see and do.  Little did I know, just how much more there was.  So I bought a motorhome and headed out west.  I had stocked the motorhome with enough food and camping supplies to last for months and set out for Boulder, Colorado.......free, single, and on top of the world.  As life has it, I was only there for a couple of weeks and ran into a gal from South Carolina who was on a similar journey that changed all that.

After a short time of running the streets of Boulder together we left out for the Four Corners area, where Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico meet.  I had met a group of new friends she was hanging out with that were our age and we decided we would all head deep up into the national forest and live off grid for a month or so.  Upon arriving, the dirt road we took up into the forest was a little perilous and saw us more than once with a road span of 9ft, in a camper with a width of 8ft, and a sheer 200-300ft cliff off the passenger side.  We were all glad to arrive safely and the group of us set up camp using tents, tipi's, hammocks and some makeshift shelters.  Her and I were kind of spoiled in the camper with the comfort of heat at night, a cooking stove and a soft bed to lay our heads.

After a month or so it had started to get pretty cold in the mountains and we decided to part ways.  A small group of us piled up in my motorhome and made our way back out of the woods, back to the highway and set off for our next journey to Sedona, Arizona.  For those who aren't aware, Sedona is home to of one of a small handful of vortexes on the planet.  A vortex or vortexes are areas of concentrated energy rising from the earth.

Many people believe that Sedona has several vortexes or power spots, making Sedona a highly sought-after spiritual and metaphysical destination.

As you approach the town of Sedona, even though its in the desert, you have to go down a very long steep and winding road.  The brakes on the camper started to make noise and by the time we got to the bottom, they were completely shot making a fierce grinding noise. The first place I could pull into was the local Post Office and I immediately parked.  Running low on funds we weren't exactly sure how we were going to solve this problem.  By coincidence, if you believe in such things, as we exited the camper, a man was just parking to go in and must have smelled our dilemma.  It just so happened that he was a local johnny on the spot mechanic, and after a brief explanation from us he offered a hot shower and to fix the breaks for free.

He directed us to roll the rest of the way thru town and told us of a free camping area about a mile on the other side.  A few hours later he arrived with a friend and tools and within a short time they had replaced all four brakes.  We were very grateful.....

We ended up staying at this very primitive camping area for about a week and during that time him and his friend came by a frequently.  We kind of befriended his friend more than him. He was about 7 ft tall with the build of an pro wrestler and we soon found out he had anger issues.  After some time together, his friend, a little more mild tempered, invited me and my companion back to his family's home to take a break from the road and to get a home cooked meal.  After intruding on his family for a few days he and his wife asked if we wanted to go to a good place in the desert they knew of to camp.  It was just outside of Cottonwood, Arizona, which was the next town down the road.

As we approached the area I noticed I was in a completely different environment than ever before.  The cacti were everywhere and the sagebrush truly rolled.  The only thing higher than a basketball goal was one mountain range with no trees about a mile away.  It wasn't even a camping area, we just kind of pulled up into the middle of the desert and the only sign of human life were some rocks piled up in a circle for fires.  We all had planned on staying in the camper so it didn't take too long to set up camp.

After a light lunch we all decided to go for a desert walk and probably stopped about 3/4 a mile from camp before heading back.  As we were walking and talking I started hearing from a distance behind us a high pitched noise that progressively got louder, the more we walked.  The next thing I knew the couple we were with, not saying anything, started to pick up their pace.  The closer we got back to the camper the louder and louder the noise became till all four of us were at a fast jog.  We threw open the door to the camper and piled on top of eachother getting inside to have a few dozen wild hogs all about a foot and a half tall stampede under and around us.  The camper swayed as they passed by. We stayed in the camper for some time after that but getting hungry and out of cooking propane we decided enough time had passed for us to build a fire outside.  Dinner was good and it had been a long day and the couple we were with wanted to retire so we thought we would give them some space and grabbed a few blankets and headed up on the roof of the camper to bed down for the night, letting them stay inside.

Getting caught up in conversation with nothing but the stars and our new found love for each other, hours must have passed and it was probably approaching midnight when I first noticed how beautiful that plain old mountain range looked in the eve of night.  The moon was high behind it, making it really stand out.  It was then that I noticed what looked like a Jeep or some kind of all terrain vehicle on the cusp of the hill which was only about three humps rolling out of the earth and probably only 1000ft high at there peak.  All's that I could make out at that time was what looked like a large headlight traveling along.   Finding it a bit unusual I continued watching as it traveled at a slow pace along the curvature of the mountain till I noticed it had turned towards us and seemed to be leaving the mountain.  That's when I nudged my new friend to take a look.  Within about 3 minutes,which seemed like 20, it had traveled from the top of the hill to almost overhead of us and I could feel her scootch herself close to my side.

It was probably the size of a half of a football field with slightly rounded corners on the bottom and almost as tall as it was long, more rounded at the top.  There were multiple pairs of very oddly colored red and green lights not in any kind of symmetrical order on the bottom that seemed to be twisting more like a barbers pole than flashing.  It made no noise...that's 0 noise...and we were in the middle of the desert so you could hear everything. It slowly made its way over our heads only about 3-400 feet above us and had slowed to 5 mph as it was directly above.  As it traveled past us about another football fields length we watched without blinking as it went into warp speed and within about 6-7 seconds it was out of sight doing a slight twisting incline as it went...still never making a sound.  We both looked at each other in the darkness of night both knowing what we had just experienced, hoping it was over....but it wasn't......

As we sat on the top of the camper quietly contemplating what had just happened, these perfectly round bubbles started appearing all around us on the ground.  They looked like thick plastic with a dull light in them and we heard scurrying in the brush.  I wasn't clear if the scurrying was due to what was happening or maybe rodents getting out of the bubbles way.  I had chills running down my spine and goosebumps all over.  This lasted another 5 minutes or so till they just slowly disappeared......and we were ok.....

This young lady later became my wife and after 2 decades we love to share this with anyone that will listen.  Most people don't really believe but we know different. Seeing is believing. It changed our lives forever.

**So I did a little research and it seems the mountain where I was facing outside of Cottonwood, Arizona, is called Mingus Mountain.....Just thought I'd share that. It was right at the highest peak when it came towards us....

July 23, 2017.  I went to take photos of the milky way at the St. Croix River canoe landing in St. Croix, New Brunswick, at about 11pm (Atlantic time).   I set up my camera, and had taken a few shots at f3.5,  25 seconds, iso2500.

I just happened to turn to the right and saw this very very bright object in the sky over head.  If I had to measure it with my fingers, I would say it was about 1 1/2 inch by 1/2inch.

I am just guessing now as it happened so fast.  I have never seen anything that bright in the sky.  It was crescent shape with  a small extension in the middle of the back side.

I tried to get my camera off of the tripod and change my settings, but could not see very well . I had a flashlight and tried to get it set, but the object was moving fast and it was almost gone.  I switched my camera to movie mode and took a couple of shots.  I couldn?t tell were I was shooting as I couldn?t see very well on my screen.  I had live view on, but my lens was at 18mm so everything looked small.

When I got home, I downloaded my photos and looked to see if I had got it.  There was only a small dot, but when you scrolled it bigger it looked like a long wire of light.  They is not very good but if you want them, you can have them.

 Please note that the postal code I put in may or may not be correct.  I was at a canoe landing  and there is no postal code that I know of.

At 6:50 pm, my wife and I were in our backyard discussing Mexican food, when I looked up and saw at approximately 900-1000 feet high an odd looking object that was definitely not a plane or a helicopter and appeared to be carrying a triangle shaped second object.  

The main object (don't know what else to call it) was very shiny and appeared to be metallic.  The top of the object resembled the shape of the letter S if it were faced backwards and seemed to have several strange cable like ?arms? that were attached to and carrying the second object.  

My wife also saw the object and also was in awe and not sure what top make of it.  

We watched it travel in an awkward zig-zag pattern heading North-East as it gained altitude for about 2 minutes, until it was at a out of site.  

Shortly after, an airplane flew overhead in the direction of the strange flying object. 

I took a  few pictures with my phone and a short video, which I will attach.

What I saw:  It was a clear night, the moon was below the horizon to the east and I was laying outside in Superior, CO, on our patio furniture star gazing above.  At 10:55PM, I was astonished to see a rather faint chevron shaped craft come into view from the east and continue to disappear to the west in only 3 seconds time.  If I hadn?t been looking in the exact location I was, then I never would have seen it, as it wasn?t particularly bright and was moving extremely fast.  It was visible to me within 90 degrees, or half the sky, and then faded away.  Before it disappeared the lights seemed to move or deform in relation to one another, each getting closer/further away from one another.  For a moment I thought maybe it was 5 separate craft flying in perfect formation, but I had noticed a body structure so this couldn?t have been the case.

Odd side note - as I?m writing this the following evening, a large black military helicopter has decided to visit our neighborhood several times.

Here are some details about the craft: It made no noise and it was very faint. It was the fastest thing I have ever seen.  There were no flashing lights but instead five good sized lights on the underside, two on each side leading to one at the front. I didn?t see the details of the front or the ends of the chevron.  The lights or something else partially illuminated the edges of the craft.  The color of the lights were whitish-yellow or that of a warm colored light bulb.  I could not denote any color to the craft so I assumed it was black like the sky.  After it passed, I estimated it to be four fingers wide when I held out my fingers to measure its width.  For me, thats about 3 inches wide at 21? from my face.

My thoughts after this happened: I thought maybe some kind of cloaking technology was used, as before it disappeared there was a weird distortion of its appearance. The lights seemed to ride an invisible wave, almost like when you look at the sun or bright light when under water - like a pool. I couldn?t specifically tell the altitude of it, but it seemed to be at least as high as the commercial jets, I can?t fathom what the size of this thing could be if it was higher.

For what it?s worth: I?m used to seeing a wide variety of aircraft fly overhead while looking at the stars, as DIA is 35 miles away so we get a lot of jets flying over.  The commercial jets seem to take about 30 seconds to cover the same area of whatever I saw.  I live next to a small airport, and we?ve had every kind of aircraft from Cessnas to Slurry Bombers and F-16s at the local air shows, they are all audible, even the very high altitude jets.




((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))

Hi Peter,

I?m a Coast Insider and knew to come to your site as I hear you on the show all the time. Great work by the way, I love hearing your reports! Oddly enough, I was actually listening to Sundays show on aliens and ufos.  Not too unlikely I suppose, but it made me think of when George says, ?Everything happens for a reason."" It was hard to not file this report while I was working, I?ve been thinking about this thing all day long.  Also, thanks for taking the time to put together such a great database of reports.

So in terms of distance, beginning to end
: 
If I were to lay on my back and hold my arms straight up to the sky and measure the angle of my arms, they would be 90 degrees or a right angle.  Now that distance that was visible was almost directly over me (it was actually offset), so 45 degrees left from straight up to 45 degrees right of straight up.  Not sure if this makes total sense, I tried to find a website with details of how to explain the arc and other details in astronomical terms. 

It was also almost travelling perfectly east to west, but I estimated that was also off by a few degrees when looking at Google Maps.  I?d say it was slightly SE to NW, but almost true West? again not sure how to best explain it.

I did have one thought I forgot to add to my  ?For what it?s worth section?.  It doesn?t have to get appended to the report, but I thought you might find this interesting.  This morning I told a coworker you never know what this thing could have been, an alien craft or a high tech military craft, one that?s probably headed to North Korea.  Five minutes later I thought to myself? 'why would it have lights on the bottom of it then!?  Anyhow, food for thought I suppose.

I was out on my patio deck smoking a cigarette, looking to the east, when I noticed a line of light, like a bright needle floating in the clear blue sky.  It was so high that I could see no details, and I don't think I would have seen it at all if it had not been perfectly perpendicular to the direction of the sun, whose light reflected brightly from its entire length.  Holding a ruler at arms length, the needle measured between 3/4"" to 1"" long.

At first I thought it might be a jet, but all I could see was that single line of light, very straight and bright, no other details at all --no wings, no curve, and barely moving.  Yet a commercial jet's wings are approximately as wide as the jet's fuselage, and there were no wings visible, nor any interruption of the straight line of light where wings ought to have been.

It was moving so slowly across the sky it appeared to be barely moving at all.

I continued to watch it for about ten minutes, until the angle between it and the sun had finally changed enough that it no longer reflected any light in my direction.

I'm an engineer who has flown commercially many times.  I know about how long a city block appears to be from cruising altitude -- tiny!  I also know how to calculate image length versus distance.

So if this aircraft was at normal jet cruising altitude (7 miles), then it was at least 1100 feet long, more than four times the length of a Boeing 747 commercial airliner.

Yet its apparent velocity was so slow that it appeared to be moving barely as much as its own length each minute, while jets cruise at 175 times their own length per minute. To stay aloft with wings at that height, it would have had to move at least 22 times its length per minute.

So if it was human in origin, it could not have been flying with wings.  Therefore, it must have been in orbit.

But if it was in orbit, then just how big was it?  That depends on how far away it was.

If it was in low earth orbit (1,200 miles) then it was at least 37 miles long.  Which strains credulity.  Also, it moved much more slowly than any LEO satellite I've watched in the night sky.

 But if it was just below geostationary orbit (22,000 miles) - say, at 20,000 miles?  -- Then its actual length was at least 625 miles long.  Which is ridiculous.

 More -- In order for its surface to reflect enough light to be seen in full daylight, it must have been a mirror-bright cylinder.  And in order for that cylinder to have a wide enough surface for the reflected light to be very bright and obvious in full daylight, its width must have been at least 5% of its length.

 Back of the envelope -- a craft only two miles long and 500 feet in diameter, with inner shells 20 feet apart, an inner core 100 feet in diameter, and assuming that the outer surface of each shell is the ""floor"", has over 100 MILLION square feet of space.  Depending on how efficiently the ecosystem is organized, a ship two miles long could easily support 10,000 people, perhaps even more if the decks are closer together and the food/air/recycling farm fills its decks from floor to ceiling.

 If the ship was actually 50 miles long and 2.5 miles in diameter with a core that was 0.5 mile wide, then it had 264 decks 20ft in height, with a total usable area of 62,000 square MILES.  The outermost deck all by itself is 392.5 square miles.  If the inner core were dedicated green space, it would provide over 78 square miles of park-like grounds.  The line of artificial suns running through the center to light the core park would be 1,300 feet overhead -- about the height of the Empire State Building.

 Ridiculous for any purpose except colonization.

 So, let's assume that it had anti-gravity to keep it aloft and stationary.  In that case it could have been at any height, though for the sake of discretion it would have made sense to be well above airliner cruising altitude.

 In that case it might have been only 15 miles high, less than half a mile long, only a few hundred feet in diameter, less than 10 million square feet of decks, maybe a third of a square mile.

Bear in mind that all the above calculations are extremely conservative.  In every case of ""between low A and high B"", I chose A or less rather than an average of A and B.

When I was younger, I experienced a traumatic event each and every night that I still cannot explain. I?ve done research but have found no conclusive answer.

Every night for as long as I can remember when I was aged 5-7, I would wake up in my bed only to see my mother walk into the room with a plate of food, speak to me saying (from what I remember) ?here?s your dinner. Sorry you couldn?t have it at the table,? place it beside my bed and disappear. Evaporate might be a better term.

Then this cycle would repeat. It would be endless and I remember staying awake for hours transfixed by what was occurring.

What leads me to believe that it wasn?t some sort of dream was the fact that I had full control over my body. I vividly remember trying to reach out and touch the food, get out of bed, move and I did these all successfully. When I would move (apart from getting completely out of bed) the ?thing? would continue. Many times I tried to talk to it but it would never respond.

I?m sorry if this was not the correct place to ask for help, but if someone can explain what was going on, I would be very grateful.

The lights looked like two separate objects it seemed as if the lights were spinning and almost communicating with each other.  The reason why I say that is because the lights swing left to right on both objects only to see two lights on each object until it went back to the left side to swing to the right again.  

Again, there were two huge objects rotating with two lights apiece.  The lights in the rotation in both objects lasted 30 seconds.  The lights were yellow and white.

To whom it may concern:

We deliver food for schools (frozen food) and like any morning we arrived little earlier then the schools opens.  While I was looking through the paperwork my driver starts screening at me if he is seeing things, he asked me if I saw the same lights as he was.  I look up and sure enough there they are.  About 10 of them in perfect line formation equal distance apart.  I wasn?t sure what was it we were looking at but I told him yes I sure do see them.  As soon as I said that these lights that were just hovering in the air rose about 20% straight up (all together) then they stopped, and then, they became instant circle like number 0 in the air.

At this point maybe 40+ seconds have passed and I jumped out of the truck grabbed my phone and started recording.  I have 48 seconds of the footage of what we saw afterwards and would love to share it with you.

I was working in a small semi-open woodworking shop near by the log house I was finishing.  There was a neighbor close but we did not associate with each other.  My wife and young child were on a 6 week holiday.  This was probably the only time in my life where a lengthy disappearance would not be noticed.

Around noon I had a sudden and irresistible urge to walk 50 ft over to the lake (?I should go to the lake? popped into my head).

I remember walking, then nothing.

The next thing I knew I was appearing as if out of a fog.  The time was about 8:30 in the morning, I was wearing the same clothes, standing in the house, and it seemed dusty and unlived in; like when you come home from a holiday.  I was very confused and disoriented.  My brain felt fuzzy, like I had just had an electric shock.

I could not figure out what day it was, what I was supposed to be doing that day etc..  I turned on the radio and it was Friday morning.  I looked at my day-timer that I kept my hours and descriptions of my work in.  The book (curiously) was open to that Friday.  I started flipping back through the days and nothing had been written since the previous Friday.  I had never (in 2 months being there) gone more than 1 day without logging my hours and what was done.  Each blank day seemed to hit me harder.

From looking around and cross referencing in my book, I could see that no work had been done since Monday.  I looked outside at my shop and everything was as it appeared the previous Monday noon.  No further work had occurred.  There was snow on the ground, so I could see any and all tracks.  My truck was where I had parked it the previous Sunday night and the bit of fresh snow since showed that no one had driven in or out since Sunday.  Examining myself, I was wearing the same clothes as Monday and they were dry and not smelly or dirty ()like they would if I had been wearing them for 5 days straight.  The house had wood heat and I could see that the firewood from Monday morning was still there. The food purchased on Sunday for the work week was all in the fridge and nothing had been eaten since Monday morning.  I checked myself in the bathroom and I was not dehydrated or hungry, nor coincidentally were there any marks on me.  (I am not sure why I examined myself.)  I tried and figure out what I had been doing for almost 4 days.  I had complete amnesia and could not remember the slightest detail.  When I look at my memory that memory is just solid white like a thick fog.

An overriding thought kept repeating in my head;  ?I must have been here working.  I must have been here working. I ...?This seemed like a post hypnotic suggestion (or in this case command).

As if in a trance, I took my day-timer and filled in the missing time with imaginary work-even though it was a complete lie!  The work I was doing was log house trim/finishing.  The rooms were so uneven that I would measure up only part of one room and mill materials just for that part, install then move forward to the next part.  It was completely obvious that no work was done, yet I filled in fictitious work.  This bothered me immensely. was completely out of character yet I still did it.  This is the only time in my life that I have cheated an employer.

The fictitious work was so well written, that even a few months later I could not figure out exactly what week this occurred.

About 6 months later I dreamt about the start of this experience.  As the dream started I immediately knew it was the day the missing time started. I was in my shop, the suggestion to walk to the lake came and over I immediately shut off my thickness planer and went over to the lake.  I looked up to the sky and it was a bright overcast day.  There was a seeming saucer-shaped hole in the clouds.  It seemed I could see through the hole into space.  The saucer shaped hole was on a 30 degree angle with the right side higher. It did not appear to be a solid object.  The inside of the hole was jet black and full of bright shining stars.  There were too many ?stars? to be actual space but this was the closest description I could come up with.  It appeared to be about a thousand feet up and about three fingers width (holding my arm extended).

I stared at this for about 10-15 seconds and I could not figure out what it was, since it seemed to be the opposite of a solid object.  I then thought ?I?m actually seeing a UFO!?. I was very excited since I have been fascinated by them most of my life, but had never seen one (or did not recall seeing one).

As soon as the thought came to me, I had an electric shock zap me-from my head to my toes and I was completely awake sitting upright in bed.  The thought of a UFO, the shock and sitting up in bed seemed to happen instantaneously.  As soon as I was awake I felt I had solved the mystery of what happened to me the previous spring.

I have tried to dream more about this and have had only snippets in my dreams.

One time I was aboard a craft with another person in front of large golden balls that had something to do with propulsion.

Another time I saw a silver craft (just landed on the ground in front of me 20 ft away).  There were about 12 smiling very attractive people sitting behind a window in the UFO facing me, men and women in shiny suits.  The people were very attractive. The window changed from clear to mirrored (like 70s sunglasses) just below eye level, so I could see all of them, but their eyes and the tops of their heads.

Other times, my dreams have discs flying about and occasionally landing.  Whenever I have the dreams I am after tired and disoriented (in my dreams).  I have never felt any fear or apprehension about my experience or during dream recollections.

I would like to have some hypnotic regression sessions since I have never regained any memory of the lost time.  Since there were close to 4 days I feel there could be some interesting details of other worlds and life forms etc.","Self employed",1,1,"disk",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1988,1980,1,2,12,"Morning",NA,1,0,0,0,0

This sighting took place somewhere in North or Northeast Raleigh, North Carolina. I lived there with my girlfriend at the time for a short while and since I rarely ventured out of the house, I was unfamiliar with the area, so I'll try to give my best recollection involving where we might have been when I saw this UFO.

We're traveling in my girlfriend's car on what I believe was Spring of 2012.  She was driving. I'm in the passenger seat and there was no one else besides us in the car.  As we're moving I was looking at all the scenery and it was a beautiful day.  In my peripheral vision, I noticed a large passenger jet somewhat high in the sky.  The jet wasn't low. I'd wager it was flying at roughly 10-20,000 feet.

That's when I saw it. Just in front of the jet's path looked to what I can only describe as an Oil Drum or a dark, almost black-looking cylinder, upright like an oil drum.  Now it was hard to tell but it looked like it was up there really close to this jet which was heading towards it.

The windows in the car were up so I heard no noise.  It just seemed to hang there, motionless in the sky.  I was excited so I told my girlfriend and she wanted to see it and asked where it was.  I said, ""It's up there, by that plane!""  Unfortunately, she couldn't look as she was driving.  I probably looked at this thing for about a minute, no more.  As we drove some trees blocked my view.  We pulled up to a traffic light and that's when I looked up again only this time all I could see was the jet and no cylinder.

To give an idea of the sizes of this jet and cylinder, at arm's length, the jet would have been about the size of my thumb and the cylinder was about 1/3 that size.  I wish I could give more information but the sighting was brief.

Just one last thing.  As I said, I was unfamiliar with the area, but I know we used to live a mile west of Route 1, a.k.a. (Capital Blvd).  We lived off of Durant road between Capital Blvd. and Falls of Neuse Rd.  The sighting was not too far from this area.  I wish I could tell you the name of the road we were on, but all I can tell you is we were no more than 5 miles from our house on our way to get a burger from this great little burger and hotdog place where you walk up to the window and they take your order.  When it's ready they call your number, go up to the window, get your food, and then we would just sit in our car and eat.

It was a horizontal cigar shape, and it was white/silver.  It wasn't were any plane could have been, and it was too high in the sky for it to be a balloon or sign.

One night, the ceiling started to shake, so I went running to my parents, thinking it was another earthquake.  At the time we used to get a lot of earthquakes during the day as many as 30 earthquakes during a single day, strong earthquakes that would topple the poorly constructed houses and it was said that the worlds end was near due to all of the earthquakes.  

Now going back to the night of the incident we noticed that only the ceiling was rattling but the ground wasn?t shaking.  So we were baffled by this, all of a sudden we see a bright light through the window, the light was so intense that it looked like if the sun was out, but it was night time.  

At the same time we can hear commotion going on outside, so we all ran outside.  When went outside we see the light right above our heads and indeed it looked like daytime.  Literally hundreds of people were witnessing this, some in panic or other like me and my family just looking at the light about 3 or 4 stories high above us.  Around it, we could clearly see the shape of the object which was rounded and only a humming sound we could hear, no wind or propulsion.  It stood there for at least 5 minutes just hovering and it suddenly took off upwards so fast that if you blinked you could of missed it and still no propulsion or wind.  We all went back to our houses and it was never talked about it ever again, we were so poor the only thing to talk about was about if we were gonna have food and all other things related to a dangerous poor area and the timing which the country was going through with the cocaine wars.  

Also, the people were so poor, I?m sure no one had a camera to take pictures or maybe too scared but a lot of people witnessed this ufo.

I'm nearly 40 years old now.  I witnessed this craft when I was about 11 or 12.  I never told anyone and just recently found out about this reporting site.

It was on or around July 4th early 1990's, I can't remember exact year.  We were at my house having a BBQ with many friends and family members.  We were all in the backyard(about 30 or 40 people).  Very clear skies.  From our NE to SE was visually wide open as there was a decline in elevation in that direction.  I estimate the field of view was easily from 020 TRUE to 160 TRUE.

I was standing in the back of the at the food table facing South, and a friend of my father's was right in front of me.  This is when it happened.

I first noticed a bright flash to my left (SE direction).  I first thought it was a reflection from a car mirror as it was driving past the front of our house, but oddly, when I looked there was no vehicle in sight coming from either direction.  This is when I saw it again, the flash was bright in the very distant SE sky.  

Suddenly, before I could really process what was going on, a saucer shaped space craft zoomed in and appeared to hover from what I estimate to be about 30 feet above my basketball hoop at the east end of our driveway(so pretty close).

I remember this in vivid detail.  This was a silver-ish flying saucer looking craft. Not quite chrome, but a lighter shade of silver.  The bottom half was bowl shaped, with a dome shaped module on top.  The dome shaped module was not quite the same circumference as the bottom half.  I remember seeing what looked like jet black port hole windows around the dome shaped area(about 3 windows).  I couldn't tell if the craft was spinning, but it was deathly silent.  Even the party seemed to be silent in my memory.

Suddenly, just as fast as it appeared, it zipped off into a NE direction until out of sight.  I remember flashing back to reality and looking at the guy in line in front of me.  Him and I were facing the same direction and the look on his face let me know that he too had just saw what I saw, but we never spoke of it.  It seems as if no one else there had witnessed it either.  We just continued in line and got our food and went our separate ways.

When I think back to this moment, it seems as if this all happened in about 1 or 2 seconds, but as I try to recall the event it just seems like much more time had passed.  How was I able to gather all that detail and feel like time was frozen as I observed this.  Who knows, maybe it was able to transplant some memories to me.

As I grew older, I was fascinated with this topic.  I joined the US Navy as an Intel Analyst and have been around the world a few times, always searching for something more.  I can't go into detail because of classification issues, but the US Government, along with other countries, are well aware of these types of occurrences and have well documented files.  I have have tracked anomalies in real time...for example, once in the South China Sea,  I tracked an aerial contact from roughly 300 miles away come directly to our position at 220 knots, but simply disappear.

Anyways, that's some of my experience and thought it'd be good to share it with you.

I want to clarify before anything else, the incident could have taken place either 3 months prior or 3 months after the date entered.  All I can guarantee, is that using information such as my work history, housing history, and the travel history of my cousin; what we saw occurred within the first 6 months of 2015. No sooner and definitely not later.  The time and location however are relatively accurate, slightly before midnight and seen from 71st Ave and Bethany Home Rd and facing South.

*All the information gathered here was obtained with the help of the other witness mentioned, all matching*   During a routine weekend at my father's house, my cousin spent the night over like he?d done a number of times before.  After arriving and spending some time playing video games I decided a snack was in order.  After realizing we were low on food, and starving, we decided to make a quick run to our local Frys/Kroger store down the street.  It was around 11:15 PM when we decided on this.

Prior to leaving, and against my cousins wishes I decided to smoke a bit of marijuana to help with the pain of being an athlete.  As a long time smoker I knew this would not drastically impair my ability to walk and/or think and that it?d help me deal with the soreness in my ankles from constant soccer.  My cousin did not ingest any marijuana, alcohol, or anything of the sort prior to either arriving at my then home or leaving with me to walk to the store.

15 minutes of prepping and smoking, and 20 minutes of walking later we were nearly there. My cousin, slightly nervous about being out so late and being caught by his father, decided to call my uncle to check in and let him know we?d be in bed soon enough (a lie).  It was during this call that I, while gazing around the familiar neighborhood noticed something above me and not at all far away in the night sky.

Only after taking 5-7 seconds to repeatedly blink and rub my eyes did I gather the sense to immediately alert my cousin as to what I was experiencing.  Above us were 6-8 near white lights, forming a perfect circle and a moderately bright one at that.  Past the lights, once hyper focused you could make out the dark saucer shape the lights were obviously a part of. There wasn?t any rotation of said lights, no pulsing, and no odd details.  The object sat stationary while being viewed and emitted ZERO fumes, projectiles, and strangely enough, sound whatsoever.  It was so quiet in fact that I recall the embarrassment of being able to hear my cousin explaining to his father/my uncle what we were seeing and practically revealing that we were outside and not in my home as he?d previously described.  I could hear cars driving by us and in the distance, I could have heard crickets if there were any, just not the craft.

After about 60 or so seconds of staring, the craft proceeded to accelerate like no aircraft I?d seen in my 20+ years of living.  The object went from being the sole focus of my vision, to zooming straight upwards and decreasing in size within an instant; vanishing almost cartoonishly.

2:35 am	  Awakened by her cat; went into kitchen to get the cat some of its food from refrigerator; she remembers considering taking her morning medication extra early (but didn?t).  Returned to bed.

3:30 am  	Awakened by a rustling noise in the kitchen/living room area that sounded like the dog prancing around when he gets excited.  She thought maybe the dog & cat were playing.  She called the dog, and he came into the bedroom in an excited state with his ears perked up and his attention was directed towards where he had come from.

She continued to hear the rustling sound (sort of like fast, small footsteps) coming from the kitchen, and assumed that it must be the cat.  She moved her body, and realized the cat was actually laying on the bed.  This cat normally reacts with curiosity when someone outside the family comes in the house, but she uncharacteristically decided not to investigate the noises, although she clearly heard them too.

Realizing she can?t blame the noise on any of the animals (and her son is asleep in bed with her), she became afraid that an intruder was in the house.  She actually considered getting her gun.

Just after having that thought, an extremely bright light coming from outside brightened up the room, completely taking her mind off the mysterious kitchen sounds.  Lying in her bed and looking out her window, she could see the underneath side of an enormous UFO that reminded her more of the Star Trek Enterprise because of its detailing and multiple shapes rather than the stereotypically shaped UFO.  It was grayish cream in color with many white lights.  Her position made it impossible to see the entire craft until it moved away. The round sections had inner soft, circular contoured bevel (like molding).  The square section was outlined with lights, and its inner part was flat and non-descript.  There was a hazy appearance around the ship.

She recalled having the presence of mind to think ?I have to try and remember lots of details, because Mom will ask a million questions.?  And ?Lots of people have to be witnessing this!?  It was hovering very low when she initially saw it, then it moved in a very slight eastward direction before it stopped.  It remained stationary for no more than 20 seconds allowing her to see the entire underneath side of the ship.

It then shot off at a tremendous speed in a southeast direction with a slightly increased altitude, causing her to sit up in bed for a better look.  Where and when it disappears from sight, she witnessed a distant lightning strike & flash/halo of haze and light around the area where it disappeared.  She mentioned that even if this was actual lightening, her perception was that it was far enough away that she wouldn?t have expected to hear thunder.

While this was going on in the sky, she heard moaning off & on outside as if someone was in pain.

Time?  	Everything went back to normal.  She wanted to check the kitchen, but oddly fell back asleep.  Her sleep was fitful, because the largest knuckle on her index finger of her left hand started hurting.

5:50 a.m.	  Woke up and took her thyroid medication which was on her nightstand.

6:00 a.m.	  Her alarm goes off.  She turned the TV on in her bedroom expecting to see a news report about the UFO.  There was none, and this frustrated her, because it was so large (football field size); people had to witness this.

6:50 a.m.	  Got out of bed and went into the kitchen (which is extremely small in dimension and just enough room to turn around).  A lower cupboard door is wide open.  She could not have missed this detail on her 2:35 a.m. trip to the kitchen.  Neither of the animals could have done this.  Her son never woke up during the night.

9:30 a.m.  	Took her jacket off at work, and the motion made her finger start hurting again. She can feel a very small bump.  It is slightly purple and feels like bruise.  It continued to hurt at the end of her workday and the time of this writing.

She claims to have had the intuitive feeling during the whole episode that this experience ?wasn?t for her?.  But, if it wasn?t directed at her, she wonders why something was happening in her kitchen.

 She said that she has never experienced anything like this.  She tried to reason that it must have been a dream, because it is too preposterous to be anything else.  At the same time, she knows it happened.  She said that her odd reaction of easily going back to sleep was disturbing, and that she felt like she had experienced psychological gaslighting.","retired; my daughter is a part time school employee",1,1,"other",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2018,2010,4,10,3,"Night","West",1,0,0,1,0

I was about 14 years old, I was having a sleep over at my friends farm.  There was six of us.  We were sleeping in a barn on sofas and blow up beds. It was mid summer and we were on our summer holidays from school.  We decided to stay awake all night eating sweets, junk food and soda.  I remember it was about 4.30 am in the morning, it was not quite night and not quite day, somewhere in between. at this time we decided to go out on our bikes for a wonder around the area.  There were no cars or people to be heard or seen.  

We were out on the main road next to the farm just riding around having a laugh when one of my friends pointed up to the sky above the farm fields and shouted ""omg look "".   We all looked up and I saw two flying saucers/metallic grey/silver disc shaped crafts completely still in the sky. two houses high above the fields.  They made absolutely no sound. I remember staring up the discs and feeling an emotion of complete dread and fear.  I do not know if I even knew what a ufo was back then until a few years later when seeing them in movies and connecting the dots.  We were so scared we rode back to the barn as fast as we could and when we got back to the barn the lights tripped out and we had a power cut.  We were too scared to sleep in the barn so we slept outside on the driveway until the morning .  

I am no longer connected to the group of people I was with during this sighting but as some one who is a regular listener to coast to coast for the past year I know for sure I had witnessed a craft from another civilisation in space.

I live in an area where you can see the planes going towards Fort Lauderdale Airport.  Also in the vecinity there is a small airport for advertisement airplanes and helicopters.  I also used to work as a night security guard outdoors.  What I saw was not planes or helicopters.

I was walking out of a food store when I saw a bright, steady red light moving east to west which at first appeared to be an airplane.  I noticed immediately it was not blinking but did not have the characteristics of a helicopter in flight at night.

I tried to photograph and video it with my cellphone.  Just as I was putting away the phone, I saw an identical object move in the same direction just a short distance behind the previous one.  For about 7 seconds I could see both bright red lights moving at the same speed.  I tried to take pictures and video.

I drove towards a neighboring area away from the bright street lights.  I had the impression that the air traffic was off, as planes appeared to be circling the airport.  I could count 4 or 5 airplanes, clearly seen as blinking lights.  Even airplanes that were moving away appeared like distant blinking dots.  A small airplane landing at the little airport nearby appeared as one red light not too bright with a blinking red light.  It was landing west to east and it was easy to identify as a small airplane.

At this point, I spotted the third, even brighter red light in the same point and moving in the same direction as the other two.  This was about 21:10 hours.  I walked away from my car to photograph and video it as it was even more clear than the other two and again did  not resemble a plane.  No sound could be heard at all.  Even the regular planes I could hear when they are visible that way, much more helicopters.

After I lost sight of the third light, I waited about 15 more minutes but could not see anything besides planes.  On video the planes also appear as blinking lights, small and white or white and red.

I work as a food delivery driver in Madison, Wisconsin, and on July 13th, at approximately 21:35 hours  I had a delivery to make and I happened to glance up into the night sky to the south.  I?m used to seeing various aircraft, both Civilian, military and commercial come and go through Truax field.  But this didn?t have the typical aircraft light set up with the Red and green navigation lights, nor was there typical landing lights.  Plus growing up near Davis Monthan AFB, I knew my aircraft well.

This was 4 red lights in a vertical diamond formation, in an up and down diamond, not a horizontal layout.  Rather close to each other with no real space in between the lights as an aircraft would have between the wings.  The object was hovering in the air, not moving at all. I was at first thinking it was possibly a drone since it was just hovering.  It also made no noise whatsoever, unlike a typical light aircraft or commercial aircraft.  And it certainly wasn?t a F-16 thats stationed here.  Compared to the near full moon, it was maybe a quarter the size of the moon.  I continued watching, pulling my car over to watch it more.  Two bicyclists peddling past also looked up, but continued peddling north.

At that point the object was moving north,  and I lost sight of it through some tall trees blocking my view.  I moved further south  and looked back to see the object heading north.  Then stop again.  And then  it split into two objects, both of 4 red lights.  And quickly both sets of lights left the area.  One heading north, the other west.  It took just a few seconds to lose sight of both.  I had viewed the object/objects at most a full 2 minutes.","Delivery driver",1,1,"diamond",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2019,2010,3,7,21,"Evening","Midwest",1,0,0,0,0

Dear NUFORC,  First and foremost, I would like to say ""thank you"" for the work that you do.

It was a lovely, clear Saturday and I was home after directing morning music rehearsals at a local church.  I was elated because the early evening was beatific in its summer breeze.

Coming home to perfect summer weather was nice, as our church building has a cold-and-spooky vibe that leaves me drained.

I was standing up on my porch, just enjoying the blue sky while my friend sat down to check her texts, when I suddenly saw something 25-50 ft overhead - something that I still cannot explain, as I have found little to no evidence.

It was a highly reflective, metallic, glittery, shapeless poof of sparks that resembled blinking stars or fireworks.  The blob was about 5 ft in length, had many sparks, appeared out of thin air and disappeared the same way.

Toward the end of its appearance, the sparks seemed to coordinate with one another to  make a formation that reminded me of a flock of birds flying very high overhead, at sunset.  I can definitely confirm that this was not that.  This was especially strange to me, and reminded me that I have a friend who has been researching UFO's for many years, and that she has found that they like to hide by imitating their environment.

Back to the event, I was slack-jawed by what I was seeing, yet immediately alarmed my friend who was not able to look up from her screen to see the 2-5 second event.  I would like to add that we were soberly sharing food, and that I don't suffer from any type of hallucinations.  Finally, I was not scared at all by the proximity of this sighting...just blown away.","Student-Teacher",1,NA,"other",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2019,2010,3,8,17,"Afternoon","South",1,0,0,0,0

Two nights in a row-On the night Oct 23 2019 my husband and I saw a star like object move around in the sky in a small area of the sky. I also watched it the night of Oct 22. It's movements were like a slow moth, some movements a straight line but mostly erratic. It stayed in the same little area of sky. In observing this for some time, I realized there was a dimmer smaller star by it and I have concluded that this bigger brighter star was connected to the smaller star, making it look like it would be a long pencil like shape, I am calling the Bigger star the head and the smaller dimmer star the end. They move together and the head will move in different directions as the end stays in place. The head also looks like it extends it's neck to move around like an insect would feeding on something or building something due staying in the same sky area spot it had been in. They look like stars. I saw another single star move across the sky and disappear by the fi! rst entity. This was looking above my backyard to the South in NE Ohio. There were no blinking lights. Aircraft in the area flew past as if things were normal. In my opinion this ufo looked like it was alive by the movement of the head star. Two stars connected, one bigger and brighter and one smaller and dimmer in a pencil shape, no seen connectors but as it moved I could see the two stars move together as if they were one, a body, with a extending head(bigger brighter star) moving around like a slow moth or insect gathering food. I am going to watch again tonight and I will make further reports if necessary.

I was returning to work after getting food on 11/28/19 around 23:50 hours and noticed 4 to 5 lights rotating in a counter-clockwise formation equally spaced apart from each other in a diameter.  The lights while rotating would zoom into the center and then back out to the exact distance they originated from above the Fed Ex Hub at the airport (Above the control tower from the perspective to my location). The clouds were low hanging, no craft was visible.  I thought that it was strange to be seeing that but also that it had to be some sort of ground light making this effect. I  asked my senior officer about this on 12/2/19 and he stated that there is nothing that would produce that over the hub.  I have not seen the pattern before or sense.

Good evening, After some consideration, I have decided to report an incident that occurred on the night of 12/21/2019.  I am a 737 Captain at a major US airline.  In 21 years of flying with an air carrier I have never seen something that I couldn?t explain in one way or another. This event is my first exception.

 Unfortunately, my times and locations for this event are not exact. The First Officer (FO) and I were so taken with what was occurring, discussing what it might have been, that I did not note this information to the degree that I should have.  I did take a screen shot of my computer flight plan later in the flight.  Time and location have largely been rebuilt using this data and the mutual recollection of myself and the FO.

We were about 2.3 hours in to our flight from JFK to SFO, cruising at 32,000 feet, Mach .79, on a magnetic course of approximately 270.  The time was about 1950 central time (0150Z) and we were roughly 50-100 nautical miles north of Kansas City.  The sky was very clear.  The cockpit overhead light was turned off, but both the FO and I had our map lights on as we ate our crew meals.  My point in describing this is to illustrate the moderate amount of light pollution within the cockpit rendering only the brighter stars visible.

While eating dinner, I noticed 5 white lights in the night sky that I initially took to be stars. They were centered within a few degrees of the nose of our aircraft.  These 5 ?stars? were in an exact diagonal line at approximately a 30 degree angle of tilt relative to the horizon. I would say their distance apart was about the same as the spacing in Orion?s belt. They were approximately 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon.  The lowest ?star? was on the left, and the highest was on the right.  When first observed, they were all the same ?medium? relative intensity to other stars.  They had zero relative motion with respect to the other stars in the area. What struck me was the linear nature of their formation.  I decided to have a look at my iPad star chart after I finished eating and continued to watch the 5 lights.

After about 5 minutes, my FO commented, ?Do you see those 5 stars out there??.  The comment was unsolicited. It had struck her as peculiar too.  We agreed that we had never seen that star formation in the sky.  We put our food away, turned off our interior lights and began watching intently for the next 15 to 20 minutes.  During that time period, the light in the middle of the row of five flared twice to a very bright intensity.  I would liken it to an Iridium flare. The remaining four did not change in intensity.  Towards the end of the time period, the two pairs of lights on either side of the center light quickly faded and were no longer visible.  Approximately 10-20 seconds after the outer pairs of lights faded, the center light flared slightly and began moving diagonally up and to the right in our field of view at about a 30 degree angle.  It moved at about half of the pace normally observed when viewing the ISS. The movement lasted for less than 10 seconds before it also faded! in intensity until no longer visible.  This final light faded in a way similar to when a satellite enters the Earth?s shadow and no longer reflects light in the direction of the observer.

That was the end of it. Not too flashy, and certainly no threat of ever going down in history as significant.  I just felt compelled to share the experience since it was so out of the ordinary for me.

The FO and I discussed various hypotheses about the lights in the aftermath.  There is no way it was an aircraft.  The extended period of zero relative motion to the background and unwavering uniformity of the formation rules it out unequivocally.  It was not naturally occurring.  The geometry of the formation indicates something man made, or other.  My perception of the flaring indicates reflection of sunlight rather than a light bulb of some sort.  These were not objects using aerodynamics.  I believe they were in space, but did not behave like a craft in orbit unless that orbit was geosynchronous.

There is probably a good explanation for this, but I have no idea what that explanation might be.  I would very much appreciate any insight you may have based on your experience.  I am hoping that perhaps you have a deeper knowledge regarding near Earth orbital operations being conducted that may explain what I saw.  I?m also hoping someone else saw it and reported the same event.

Thank you for your time.","Airline Pilot",2,5,"formation",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2019,2010,4,12,19,"Evening","Midwest",1,0,0,0,0

On January 14th, 2020 I was driving down the highway, heading home for my lunch break to let my dog out for food and a bio break. I noticed a large dark rectangular object in the sky about a mile down the road that appeared to be floating in the sky. It flew slowly, almost like it was floating, over the highway I was driving on. At first, I didn?t think twice about it as it was heading towards our airport. So, I figured it was an airplane, but I still watched it while I was driving and witnessed it fade away, presumably into a cloud from what I could tell. So, I thought the sighting was over, but it wasn?t. The object faded back into view and floated back across the highway heading to where it first appeared. It kept on moving away from the highway and then stopped about a quarter mile away the highway and descended towards the ground in a straight and steady line with no wavering motion.  I wish I could have gotten a video instead of the picture from my car! . By the time I got video ready on my phone, it had already descended behind the tree line. I looked around the sky for it as I drove down my residential street, where it looked like it might have descended, but I didn?t see anything out of the ordinary. A video would have been so much more telling than the photo I took, but I have a before and after picture that shows the object in the sky and one that shows no sign of the flying object. Clearly it wasn?t a normal object on a pole or tower or something and was definitely not an airplane, and too large to be a toy drone. When I returned to work, about an hour later I went deaf for about 30 seconds with a loud ringing in my ears, I couldn't hear the person talking to me. Not saying the two are related, but certainly not ruling it out either. My background is clean, I don't drink alcohol, I have never used any drugs and was not on any prescription drugs at the time of this sighting. I'm just a normal guy with a normal job try! ing to make a living.

I walked out side to get food off the grill when i noticed a weird lighted triangle about 5000 ft above doing axis over axis rotation with a red light at the mid point on all 3 sides. I grabbed my friend to show him and when we looked up again we noticed dozens of the objects at that seemed were maintain their altitude but in a constant gyroscopic rotation that. after a moment we noticed the sky it covered in these triangular craft but these appeared almost as they were in orbit like a star and the earth was rotating. 2 groups of these craft about 10 or so in each were in the formation of the little and big dipper. in the east there was few one looked to be over JRB air base but over the west in orbit looked like a WW2 movie with dozens and dozens of these craft similar to a bombing squadron but not advancing and the only movement was the earths rotation as the crafts that seemed to be in orbit like a star and were in the same place in the sky almost two hou! rs later. I got a picture that was clear when i took it but after i sent it as a text message it appeared the iphone camera picture lost its resolution (i know this sounds crazy but i have a witness). I started to take video on my iphone 11 and this too captured these triangular craft in the west above aledo texas with a perfect white outline that would appear to turn into an orb as you got closer with the zoom. Thinking I zoomed in too far and the orb was just too much focus, i backed out the zoom just a little bit and I could clearly see a rotating octagon shape gyro scoping around its own axis.   The pictures are no longer clear and in the video that showed the lower flying air craft outlines are blurry after i text messaged them from my iphone but the the orb typed objects that showed during my zooming on the video (zooming during the incident) are clear as day of the object that showed a clear outline of the craft by eye and by iphone camera at no zoom turned into a gy! ro scoping octogon orb. I could only see the orb as i zoomed i! n on cam era but when I would look directly at the craft i never saw the orb this was only seen on camera as it zoomed in to a certain point. I was suprised to wake up and see no coverage or reports of this incident as it was a saturday night over DFW Texas and the whole time we watched we didnt see one single commercial or private air craft and we are 30 miles from DFW Airport and 3 miles from JRB Airstation, and along hwy 30 west where careflight and often 3 chinook helicopters fly  over using the below hwy as a visual visual route.

I was out running[in S.F.] some errands and was walking towards a local supermarket to get some food and then head home.  As I was walking down this street,  I saw in the corner of my eye and up in the sky, what seemed to be quite a large or circle.  It was way larger than a star and at 1st,  I thought of the possibility of it being the planet Venus, since it does come close to our planet around this time and is visible, however out of curiosity I decided to sit there and observe it and the 1st odd thing I noticed was how it had some sort of glowing iridescence from its upper right side.

 As I kept watching, I noticed these weird ""spikes"" came out of it and they would pop in out of it.  The color of these spikes was like light colored except for some spikes that were yellowish.  I saw a passenger plane fly underneath it, although in reference, it was obvious that this UFO was at a much higher altitude.

 I pulled out my phone-camera and held it in my hands so that it be completely still and as I was doing this, from my eyesight(which is 20/20), this thing seemed stationary, yet when applied the infinite zoom on my phone, this thing came on my screen that was whizzing around in circles...it was very odd. I was right the grocery store and went and finished my shopping and when I came out the grocery it was still there but had moved a little to the northwest.

 I dropped off my groceries and tried to relax from a weird excitement I felt and decided to go back out see if I could spot it again. I went up a couple blocks and looked up and at 1st I saw a constellation of stars and then to the left of those stars I saw this thing again with those weird spikes and you could see how much bigger it looked in reference to the stars nearby, except this time, it was mobile and was circling in weave type patterns.","None (disabled and retired)",NA,1,"egg",1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2020,2020,1,2,19,"Evening","West",1,0,0,0,0

I was informed that he saw it as well and even caught it on his dash cam in his vehicle.  It did not dissipate like a shooting star or comet would usually.  Both of which are not unusual for the area.  Shortly after there was a search helicopter in the area last seen doing circles.

I noticed a light green light in the sky moving strangely, I observed for about 10 seconds and pulled out my iPhone to record the event. The object was making very sharp maneuvers and flashing bright then getting dim again. This object flew at a rapid speed and changed direction like I have never seen any aircraft do before. After about two and a half minutes of recording it disappeared. You can not see the green color in my video but it reminded me of the color of mint ice cream. Like white mixed with green. There are parts of the video where it is hard to see the craft but if you can zoom in you can follow it for almost the entire video. For a moment it disappears behind a satellite dish but will reappear going the opposite direction shortly.

My husband and I were traveling westbound, on a back country road, making a food delivery to a customer. Off to our left side, my husband noticed 2 very bright white lights initially trailing after each other. When he mentioned it to me, I dismissed him and said it?s just airplanes. Then, both white lights came to a dead stop in the sky. We both watched the first light turn blue (it was ahead of the other light behind it). We both started to feel uneasy and anxious. Then the one behind it took off in the opposite direction ( heading south west) at a very fast rate of speed, while the first one began moving in our direction. It changed back to a white light and appeared to stop over our vehicle. In that moment we lost our radio reception. It turned to absolute static. It hovered above us for what seemed like forever, in reality was more like 1 minute. There was no sound to it. After about 1 minute of hovering, it took off heading northeast at a high rate of s! peed. We eventually lost it, as it just vanished. We looked back to the south west and the 2nd white light had vanished as well. Once the one that hovered over our vehicle took off, we got our radio reception back.

Subject: Loss of time!    In the late 90's, when there was a sphere over Las Vegas, a friend and I experienced MULTIPLE U.F.O.'s of all shapes.  I am scared to write this.

When a friend and I got done working for the day we left from Vegas on our way back to Kingman, it was dark and late , we just passed thru Boulder heading down the long road to the dam. We were talking about what to do the next day about work when the truck lights and radio flickered and went off.  Then the truck stalled.  I laughed and said, "" Oh no, aliens.""  The truck kept rolling down the street, even tho stalled.

After a few seconds we looked at each other then looked up thru our windshield.  There it was right above us. We could barely see it.  But with the light of the moon we can see the shadow, just hovering above us.  Way too close!!!  Then it was gone.

The truck started and we pulled over to the left on a dirt road and went back about 1/4 off the road. My heart was pounding, my hands are tingling still as i write this.  We just looked at eachother . He said ""You seen that right?"" I said ""Yes."",breathless.

We talked a few just staring at the sky.  We decided to just stay there for the night. We were there about an hr when we started seeing a flicker of light slowly coming across the sky.  It was small like a star but moved slowly flickering off and on like it was stalling or the engine was failing.  Then all of a sudden it got to a star (or we thought it was a star). We saw the little one line up under the brighter one and then all of a sudden there was a line barely noticeable from the one to the other. The bigger brighter one slowly lifted up the flickering one until it disappeared. Then it just stayed there, like a star that was supposed to be there.

I don't know how long we sat there until we noticed more lights of red and yellow and white colors just sitting above the mountain beside us. It was HUGE. It went from one side of the mountain to the other just hovering above it. Lights just blinking.

We were paying so much attention that i barely noticed the lights on the ground in front of us. I seen half circle lights that were red green and orange floating on the ground about 20-30 feet ahead of the truck. At first I thought street stop lights. But there was no lights in our area.these moved very slow and as I looked closer they were moving behind the bushes. I can see the bushes in front of them. There was at least 10 of them moving slow and bright but not that bright. I was scared, VERY SCARED! We watched them for a few minutes, actually a long few minutes.

In our old pick up truck we had no lining on our inside roof. All of a sudden there was a flash like a photograph behind us to where we could see our shadows of our heads on the ceiling. I turned to look and there was another one. I saw 5 yellow squares that seemed to be part of another craft. Barely moving up in the sky about 100 ft up and 100 feet back from us. It had 2 yellow squares on top and 3 on bottom.

I told him to look. He did. Now I was beyond scared! It just sat there floating back and forth. I was so scared I just started blurting out,"" Oh my god we got to go"". I screamed, ""We gotta go!"",""I love you we gotta go!"" But we didn't not move. We just watched. It seemed forever. We did not want to go to sleep. Then I felt like my body was going to vibrate. We had nowhere to go they were all around. I looked in front of the truck again to see how close the ones on the ground were getting closer they were. They were small tho. Only about 1-2 feet long and about 1 ft tall.

Just then this bright light shot out of behind this side of the cliff behind them and just stopped. It was maybe 50 ft off the ground about a football field ahead of us. I froze.

We felt like it was just staring at us. My friend grabbed his 500 candle flood light from behind the seat. He wanted to get out and shine the light on it. I FREAKED OUT!!!! He opened his door and stood on the door frame and shined the light on the thing.

It looked like a very shiny silver bell. Like the kind you ring on the counter at a store for service. Then it started to move towards us. I screamed and started crying. He jumped back in the truck we locked the doors. I don't remember if all the other lights were still there. We watched it for hrs it seems It just stayed there and moved very slowly upward. VERY SLOWLY! Almost to where you couldn't notice. The next thing I remember is waking up laying with my head on his lap and he was waking up with his hands on the wheel sitting as if he was driving and it was morning. Not just morning.....the sun has been up for hrs. We went back to Vegas to go to work. We told two friends. They joked saying I could be pregnant. We told no one else.

 There was a lot of talk in Vegas. About a flying silver cigar just hovering over the city. We knew it was the same craft as the one we seen come from behind the mountain.

   Later that day we started back to Kingman again . We decided to stop by the spot that it happened. When we got close to it we saw 12 black helicopters directly over the sight where our truck was parked. We slowed down. It was weird. Now we know we didn't imagine it. This was proof. there was 3 helicopters side by side going north to south. 3 going south to north. Going in between each other , combing. Then the other six doing the same from west to east and east to west. But they were just over that area that we seen all of it.

   We pulled over further up the road and got out. We saw what looked like impressions of crutch bottoms all over the sides of the road.

 We got back in the truck. Continued on to kingman. We went and rented a camping spot in the Hualapai mountains to clear our heads and of course watch the skies.

 In the morning we were packing up and this black suv came by our camping spot moving very slow. All the windows even the windshield was dark. We just seen shadows of four men. They left. We got a little freaked out. So about a half hr later we were heading down the mountain into kingman when we saw it again It was pulled off to the side of the road and someone was standing out on the passenger side. But I couldn't see him the back door was open and blocked everything of him except his shiny black dress shoes and black pants. As we went by I turned to see if I can catch a glimpse. He seemed to turn exactly the same time our truck passed. But I saw his stature. He was a broad shouldered man with dark hair. He had on a white dress shirt and black suspenders. When we got further away he jumped in the suv. I still saw nothing of the inside or of the other men in the vehicle. It was all limousine black tinted out.

    Since that night and the day with the suv. I still see the suv. But not often. Just every other year or so. Just sitting in a parking lot when i am shopping and when i go to look at it after I get in my vehicle its gone.

  Since this occured my friend has shot himself in the head, but survived. I don't know if he remembers the incident or not. I think he is lucky if not. Me.......I sometimes have to take pills to go to sleep. 1 time I woke up on my bed in the middle of the day not remembering how I got there, screaming my ex husbands name because I couldn't move. It felt like someone was holding me down just by my forehead. I screamed and screamed but nothing came out. Then it was over.

   I still feel sometimes a numbing starting in my head and feeling like I'm going to become paralyzed again. I have constant ringing in my ears. When I wake up in the morning for the first few minutes before I'm fully awake, I hear what sounds like morse code. I don't even know morse code.

   Well that's my experience. I went thru my stress again telling it. My hands are numb and my hearts racing. But I do feel some release telling it. In a way I want to know what happened in our lost time. I was looking for hypnotists to know. Then again who do I tell.

It was the night before Thanksgiving, when my twin and I were around 8 or 9 years of age, so it would have been around 1967 or so.  The reason I remember it was the night before Thanksgiving was because a family member was over helping our mother prepare food for the next day.  We were told to go get ready for bed. We walked into our bedroom and looked out the window.  We were always doing that; it drove our parents crazy.  We were always looking out the windows at night; weird...anyway, we hadn't even turned on the bedroom light.  

Across the street, next to the top of a large evergreen tree, were two oval shaped blue lights, next to each other.  They only stayed for a second or two and then shot upward and over our house, almost as if they did not want to be seen.  

We were so scared!!  We ran from our bedroom and tried telling the adults about it, but being busy, our concern was prett! y much dismissed.  We were told we were seeing things and the matter was dropped. We were pretty shaken.  At that age I had no idea about dimensions, height etc.  All I remember were two glowing blue lights that disappeared almost suddenly.

Her grandfather had a house near were we were.  Her and I went into the house and made a pot of coffee got some snacks and food for the children to eat and sat down at the table on the porch which was a screened in porch that was connected to the house without a wall they had taken down the wall between the kitchen and the screened in porch the table was in the screened in porch we were sitting and talking and I could see something in the back of her head and it just appeared.

I looked at it and she turned around to see what I was looking at, cause she'd notice that whatever I was looking changed my whole demeanor.

It went from my right to my left down to my right to my left again and I said ?Bell do you see what I see. She says ?yes I do?.  It came to the right again but it kept getting closer and it came up over o ur car which was across the driveway, the way we had the car parked, there was a driveway and then the cars would park facing the swamps with the back to the driveway.

It hovered over our car about 10 feet above the car approximately 5 to 6 seconds and zoomed off Into the woods in the swamps.

It was very large I would say 3 times the size of a car and it was shaped like a saucer the side slanted down there was a half round dome on the top than the bottom slant matched the top slant.  There was what looked like a band on the bottom with lights. The top set went right and the bottom set went left.  It was metallic. the lights were white like a car headlights.  It was silent, not even a whisper . The leaves didn?t even move when it flew away.  I?ll never forget that as long as I live.

We grabbed our  ours I said let's get outta here, and  we ran out the door.  Our husbands had been fishing in the little creek next to the house, they beat us to the car and we drove out of there. We were scared.  I never talked about it again, because one- everybody would have told me that I was crazy.  Two at that time if you said anything they would put you in the insanity house.

There was one spot in each side of the circle across from each other that was a gap in the light.

 We proceeded tk take photos and videos in the sky and throught the telescope.  Looking with the naked eye or phone camera it looked like a star.  However the telescope showed its true form.  Higher than thr planes in the sky it stood in the same spot.  Not moving an ich it seemed to flex from circle to oval shaped.  We all sat staring until around 8:36 pm the clouds covered the craft from sight.

 Thick dark clouds obscured the object however it was visible here and there through spaces in the cloud. A small storm rolled in and the craft completely disappeared from sight.

At approximately 1900, Friday, 14 August 2020, while on duty of gate security at North Fort Hood Army Base, Gatesville, TX, myself and two of my fellow security officers observed two white objects in the Northern Portion of the sky at about a 45 degree angle up in front of the Main and only gate to North Fort Hood Army Base, TX.  The two objects were white in color but not a metallic shiny white, more of a dull chalky white but were round in shape with no wings or any lights observed.  The two objects were approximately 80-90 feet apart from each other with the object on the right about 20 feet in the sky lower the than the object on the left and appeared to be farther away.  I do not know the approximate altitude of the objects because I have never seen them before so I do not know their relative size to be able to determine how high up they were.  If I had to guess their altitudes, I would say approximately 10 to 15 thousand feet.  They were not moving at all and I do not know how long they were there; it is like they were perfectly suspended in the air.  The sky at this time of day was still blue and stars were not yet visible so you could still observe other aircraft such as helicopters (olive drab H-60 Blackhawks) flying and landing in the nearby helo pad to the North of our front gate but they too did not require lights at this time.  There were also two takeout food delivery people who use their own vehicles to enter the base to deliver food to our Soldiers who also observed the objects and they two commented about how strange the objects were.  Then all of the sudden after maybe 20 minutes, both objects disappeared.  I do not know exactly how they disappeared or if they just moved out of the area because we could not stay looking at them the whole time because we had to focus on our job of checking ID cards for those persons entering the base.

One of my coworkers who observed the objects that Friday night saw the same object above his backyard in Copperas Cove, TX, approximately 20 miles from the Gatesville, North Fort Hood sighting, on the afternoon of Sunday, 16 August 2020, and that is the one which is labeled as such.

Myself and my coworkers have never seen anything like this before and we cannot tell you what we think it is because we just do not know.  That is why I am submitting this report.  I am really ashamed of the photos I am submitting but as I said, this is all we have.  There is also a short video of the objects from Friday 14 August but the quality is very poor because it is so pixelated.  Please when you open up the JPEG file of the photos zoom them in and you will see that white dot in all photos but understand that when you do that; the image will not be sharp.  As I worked the same location on Saturday and Sunday 15 and 16 August at the front gate of North Fort Hood, I did not see the objects.  I have never seen a UFO before so I cannot tell you that these objects are UFO?s but I do believe they exist.  Please provide some sort of feedback at your earliest convenience as to what you and your staff think these objects were.

I do not remember the exact year, day, or time due to having memory problems about the event. Its like the harder I try to remember, the more it fades, like a dream . I do know for a fact though that this was not a dream as my sister witnessed it as well.  It was during the annual Perseid meteor shower, so July-August, between the years of 2006-2008 I believe. I know I was still in high school.

This is what I remember clearly.  My sister and I went outside at around 2 a.m. to watch the meteor shower on our front lawn.  We were laying down in the grass and watching the meteors, they were very bright and numerous, when I noticed something in my peripheral vision.  I looked, at this point my sister was looking at it too, and literally on top of the tree line directly across from our driveway,  so very close and low, was a line of fixed lights that were changing colors.  They seemed to be attached to something that was not visible to our eyes.  The lights stayed in the same spot, they did not shift position at all. If whatever they were attached to was a craft, then it had the ability to hover without any movement or noise what-so-ever.

It was completely silent. There was an unnatural silence about the world that was noticeable.  Any background noise was gone.  It was like we had been isolated in a bubble away from the rest of the world; that is the only way I can describe this complete lack of sound.

We watched the lights move around what appeared to be an invisible, disc-shaped object for what seemed like a few minutes and then it was gone.  I blinked and it was gone.  I don't know if it just turned off the lights and was still there or if it took off, but it did it in the blink of an eye without making a single sound or leaving any trail or evidence.

I'm not sure what happened after that. It was like it was immediately gone from my memory. I don't know if I talked to my sister about it, if we finished watching meteors, when we went back inside, I don't remember. When I did remember the incident, which was YEARS later, it was like I was remembering a dream from long ago and could not grasp the whole story or all the information. I only know it actually happened because my sister witnessed and remembers it too. She did not remember it though until I asked her about it years later and then she described to me the same thing I remembered, but that the memory was weird and fuzzy.

Other experiences possibly worth noting were my only ""sleep paralysis"" experience in which I saw a being of light and weird geometrical bruising that appeared on my back as a child. The sleep paralysis experience was weird, because I thought that I had the ability to move, but when I tried I experienced so much pain throughout my body that I just held still as to not experience anymore pain. The whole time a very tall being made out of light was observing me. The bruising happened when I was maybe 10, I was camping in Nikiski, AK and woke up with geometrical(squares, rectangles, triangles) bruises covering half of my back. Not sure if these are related, but food for thought.","House wife",2,1,"disk",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2008,2000,3,8,2,"Night","West",1,0,0,0,0

We pulled into the driveway and parked my car and had our usual end of the day catching up before getting out.

Once we got out of my car I took about five steps and was standing behind his car, which is parked directly to the left of mine, and noticed movement in the sky above me.

I looked up and to my shock saw a boomerang shaped craft about 150-200ft off the ground cruising slowly over our house, the wildest thing was that it was completely silent. I could hear crickets chirping and cicadas all around us but not this thing.

It was heading towards the southeast. I watched it for a good two seconds before i slapped my friend on the shoulder and told him to ?Look at that fucking thing? and he saw it as well, we both watched in complete disbelief for another two seconds before it disappeared behind a tree that?s in a neighbot?s yard behind our house. After me freaking out for a good two minutes I told him to get in the car because we were going to try to follow it since I thought it would be flying towards a specific area that has been known, by my family at least, to be a small hotspot for UFOs/ UAPs. Unfortunately we did not end up seeing it again after we lost sight of it behind the tree. If i had to guess I?d say it turned before we got in the car to try to follow it, I genuinely believe there should be other witnesses to this somewhere in town because of the simple fact that it was flying so low.

 Description: The craft was boomerang shaped and 25-35ft from wingtip-to-wingtip. It was mostly black but the perimeter of the craft was white with lights(?) that were turned off lining the outside of it. The tree it eventually disappeared behind is probably 75-80ft tall and this thing was NOT far from the top of it at all. It was moving very slow, it?s hard to put a MPH estimate on it but it went from overtop where our pool would be to disappearing behind a tree in about 4.5 seconds.

I am a 22-year-old white female college student studying English and Creative Writing. (Hopefully any talent I have in the field will aid in this description.) I wouldn?t exactly call myself a conspiracy theorist, but I am openly receptive to the idea that there are things among us that we don?t understand. I don?t know if this is pertinent, but I have a background of depression and anxiety, though I was experiencing neither during this event. (Up until I saw the UFO. Then, I will admit, I was very anxious.)  At approximately 19:30 on October 9, 2020, I was sitting alone in my car in a McDonald?s drive-thru on the north side of Terre Haute, Indiana. The sun was setting, but it was still bright out; the sky was a pastel pink. As I waited for the cars ahead of me to move on, I noticed what looked to be two stars hovering in the west?the direction that I was facing. They were bright white pinpricks of light contrasted against the sky. It?s hard to say the shape, simply because they seemed so far away. Upon closer inspection, I could see that at least one of them had a short trail, and in an attempt to reconcile the strange object, I told myself it must be a couple of planes, despite the fact that planes do not emit light in that way.

 (The trail was odd looking, too. Not smoke, but it appeared to be made of light.)  The drive-thru line was not long, but long enough for me to stare for a minute or two. Long enough to have noticed any movement, or a direction in which the ?planes? were heading, if there was any. But they simply hovered, completely still. The trail that had been left by the one had dissipated in a matter of moments. I pulled out my cell phone and attempted to take pictures, but the points of light were too small for my camera to pick up. At this point, I suspected that it might be a UFO, but had other explanations to put myself at ease, as well. I knew that Mars and Venus were supposed to be bright this month?perhaps that was all I was seeing.

 However, as I was focused on the original two points of light, two more appeared. I first noticed the third, and then as my gaze shifted, a fourth. All close together, and all unwaveringly still. I distractedly pulled forward to the pickup window, and accepted my bag of food before pulling out of the parking lot and heading home.

 I took Fort Harrison Rd west toward 13th St and continued to anxiously watch the points of light (what I even now struggle to call UFOs) as I drove. So intent on watching them in fact, needing to track any movement and at this point terrified of what it might mean, I was not as focused on the road as I should have been. I made it back to my home in one piece, but only after I told myself to look away and pay attention to what I was doing. I wanted to look around at the other drivers on the road, to see if they were reacting the same way, if they even noticed, but my mind was scattered, and I was far too anxious to do anything but race home.

 The moment I arrived back at my house, I headed to the back yard to get a clearer view of the sky, but there were too many trees blocking my view, so I went back in. Sat down. Feverishly Googled what it could be, and found with a blossoming dread that it couldn?t be Mars and Venus. Not only are those planets located in different quadrants of the sky, but are visible only at different times of the day. Perhaps one of the lights I saw was Mars, but that doesn?t explain the other three.

 Later that night, I did further research, and was momentarily relieved to find there would be a meteor shower that same night, but the details about the meteor shower didn?t line up with what I saw. According to a local news site, the Draconid meteor shower is small, and one should only expect to ?see a few meteors streak across the sky in an hour.? And though the Draconid meteors move slower than those in other showers, they only last ?one or two seconds,? which does not account for the several minutes that these UFOs were in my line of sight.

 And these could not be stars. Even neglecting the fact that one of them had a trail, nowhere within city limits could you see stars shining that brightly, especially before nightfall. Truly, I would like for there to be some other explanation. But the more I go over the memory of what I saw, the more I?m convinced that the only logical explanation is UFOs. I relayed this experience to a trusted friend who used to live in Arizona, a well-known hub for UFO activity, and she told me that my description matches that of her own experiences. I did a few different Google searches to see if anyone had reported anything similar, but I came up empty-handed. So I decided I had to do it myself, even though thinking about it fills me with that same dread as before.

 I don?t think I?ll be getting any sleep tonight.

I was traveling east with my fiance on Bay Rd. in Hadley MA around 7:20 (right before Atkins) when I first noticed a single low, bright, color shifting object just above the tree line. I had seen lights exactly like this before several times, all near or above water sources (see my previous post from January 2019 of seeing a diamond shaped craft hovering low over the Connecticut River while traveling home from work in Northampton/Holyoke on rt. 5). For this particular sighting, initially I only saw 1 light. It was definitely not a plane, helicopter, or drone as the light pattern was a rapidly changing almost opal or diamond like random color pattern, not a standard FAA color scheme or pattern that planes and helicopters have. I asked my fiance who was driving at the time if he saw it too and he confirmed that he did. It was not moving in the sky and remained stationary as we headed into Belchertown continuing on Bay Rd. and turned off on our street shortly b! efore Bay Rd. merges onto rt 9. When we got to our home, we could still clearly see the same light from our front yard. It had not moved. We went inside and about an hour later came out again and it was in the same spot. I noticed now that it looked like there was a small helicopter flying near it, like it was observing the strange light from a close distance. It was a much smaller, much dimmer flashing white light next to it. We watched this for another couple of minutes and the strange light began to go from bright, almost sparkling like color shifts to pure blackout (this could have been due to some clouds). It appeared to be right over Quabbin reservoir near the Belchertown/Pelham line which is a few miles from our house. After watching it for a few more minutes, it made a pretty sudden and small shift in direction, looking like it was headed towards us (headed west) in the sky. We could tell it was moving towards us because it got slightly larger in size and brightness! very fast. Once it appeared to have stopped moving, we headed! out bac k (traveling west) towards Bay Rd. to get some food on rt 9 when I looked up and saw that there were actually several of these lights lining what appeared to be the outline of the lower portion of the Quabbin reservoir along rt 9 heading into Ware. I counted about 4 or 5 that were low and close enough that I could see them clearly before we had to turn onto Bay Rd. and they would be completely behind us from the car. The lights seemed to be in a type of line or formation or like I said, lining the reservoirs edge or at least the lower portion of the water from my vantage point.

 I had only seen these kinds of lights in a diamond shape per my previous sighting so to see them individually spread out like that was the only difference from my first sighting. The lights/crafts were far enough apart that it couldn't have been 1 craft but rather a series of possible sentinels or smaller crafts hovering over different points along the water. As we headed toward rt 9 via Bay Rd, I noticed another single light like the ones we just saw but it was over the Northampton/Hatfield area. It was also pulsating at a fast rate several different brilliant colors and was also low in the sky. It was the same type of light/craft but by itself, possibly over the Connecticut River. I am not sure why every time I see these lights they are hovering over or traveling along a river or other waterway, but I can't deny what I saw. After seeing the same type of light multiple times, this time having my fiance also see them and confirm what I was seeing/what I said I had seen befor! e, it made me feel like I wasn't crazy and legitimized my/our experience. We are moving to Belchertown shortly and even though this wasn't the first time, I suspect it won't be the last time I see some unexplainable things in the night sky near Quabbin.

How we treat animals and lesser beings here, is also how they treat us. A what you put in, is what you take out perspective. They make actions based on your own actions, if you treat animals in an in-humane way they also do that to us. Remember most of these entities have direct defendants on this planet, just at an animal level. They watch your every move constantly, ever action or reaction you take apart in is known and recorded.

Background  Just before Christmas in 1955,  when I was seven-years-old, my family moved from a uranium mining camp located on the Dolores River, some 24 miles north of Dove Creek, Colorado, relocating to Moab, Utah.

 My Dad told me that most of the guys that worked at the mine were veterans from WWII, but they didn?t talk about the war.  One of them gave me a large model of a navy destroyer, one that matched the ship he had served on.  Audie Murphy had just appeared in ""To Hell and Back,"" and we went to the drive-in at Cortez, Colorado to see the movie. These facts would be important to my perception of what was to happen.

 In June 1956, my parents took me back to Colorado, where I spent a week at the home of my friend, Frankie.  We ran all over the hills, playing and when it rained, we did our best to catch a rainbow to see if there really was a pot of gold.  No matter how fast we went, the end of the rainbow kept ahead of us.  On Friday, my parents drove to Colorado to pick me up and to take Frankie back to Moab.  Our elementary school was in Egnar (Range spelled backwards) surrounded by farms, many of which were bean fields.  It was after work on Friday when my parents drove to Colorado and it was dark by the time we headed back toward Moab, probably 9 pm or later.

 What We Saw  As we headed west on Highway 491 maybe a mile or two east of the Colorado-Utah border, my Mom spotted what appeared to be a bright light on the north side of the highway, lighting up the field below it.  She asked Frankie, ""Why do they have lights in the bean fields?""  He assured her that they didn?t do that.  The light was very bright and looked like it was just high enough to be at the top of a light pole.

 While the road was level, there was a small embankment of varying heights between the road and the fields to the north.  As we drove closer to the light, it was obscured now and then by the high spots of the embankment.  When we got to the point that the light was directly to the north of us, the bright light shot directly up into the sky, stopping at a level that might have been 300 or so feet above the ground.

 When we first saw it from a distance, the light looked like a round spot.  When we drove up to it, it was not round at all.  It was shaped like a long cigar, with rounded ends.  My Dad pulled the car over and we parked at the side of the road to watch the light.  It was a bright bluish-white.  Because of the distance we were away, it was difficult to say exactly how long it was, maybe 100 feet or so.

 As we watched, several smaller round lights came out of the west (left) end of ship, maybe 8-10 or so.  They lined up under the main ship, in a line parallel to it.  The exception was the 2nd or 3rd light, that was out of line, maybe 10 to 20 feet below the rest.  Then, a larger, brighter round light came out of the main ship.  As it went under the line of smaller lights, the one that was out of line moved up to the line, putting them all into a straight line.  I observed at the time that the bigger ship was acting like a drill sergeant and the lights were the trainees.  He was there to get them into shape and keep them in line.  (My perspective came from the Audie Murphy movie, I suspect.)  Then, they put on a show of dazzling aeronautics that was wonderful.  Each ?trainee? would shoot directly toward the ground and make a 90-degree turn just above the ground, go about 100-200 feet then shoot directly upward, and then back to the line where it had started.  Some took diagonal courses, but most were 90-degree course changes.  They did not slow as they made the corners.  They were very, very fast.

 We had been to the drive-in movie in Cortez several times, including To Hell and Back and my favorite, Davy Crockett.  There were times when the movie screen went dark and we were invited to visit the snack bar for over-priced food.  Many cars in the 1950?s had spotlights.  During the time when the screen was black, a number of drivers would shine their spotlights on the screen and play tag with each other.  The spotlights dashed right to left, up and down, and every direction, without accelerating or slowing when they made a ?corner.?  That is a perfect comparison to what we were seeing in the sky that night.

 There were two differences though.  First, when the lights took off or made corners, they would change from blue to a yellowish, almost orange color, then back to blue as they sped straight ahead.  Second, they made a humming sound that we could hear, though we were maybe 100 yards away from them.

 I recognized that sound.  When Frankie and I were out playing on the fields that week, I heard a low humming sound.  As we got closer to the high-power lines crossing the fields, it was obvious that they were the source of the hum.  The small lights made the same humming sound as they did their ?training exercises.?  We watched the ?show? for maybe 15 minutes.  My little sister, aged 6, was totally silent.  Frankie was shaken and began to cry.  My Mom assured him that we were safe.  The objects didn?t do anything to acknowledge that we were watching and had made no moves toward us.  Frankie stopped crying, but wasn?t certain we were safe.

 The end of the show came when all of the lights ended their training and the all headed directly north as a small company of recruits, led by a sergeant and the main ship.  My Dad said, ?We need to tell someone before they get away!? and drove west to the Highway Patrol Weigh Station, just a few minutes away.  When we got there, we got the trooper to come out and look.  By then, the lights were so far away that they were lost among the stars and their motion was not obvious.  He couldn?t see them.

 Then What?  When we got back home to Moab, we told everyone.  Dad was called ?flying saucer boy? at work and soon learned to keep his mouth shut.  It was summer, so I couldn?t tell my schoolmates.  Frankie didn?t want to talk about it.

 Life went on.  We never saw anything like it again, even though we often searched the skies for moving lights.

 I'm 72 now and that is the long version of our short experience.

I was 18 I was visited one night in a night terror/abduction/sleep  paralysis like episode. I had not done any drugs at that point in my  life, was currently living at home and was raised in the Mormon church.

 I awoke suddenly to my pitch black room....sweating with a feeling of unease, a feeling of a presence. When I tried to move I realized I was totally paralyzed expect for my eyes. I scanned the room with my eyes. To my absolute horror I saw a large column in the center of my room that was darker than the darkness of my room. Something was there, my eyes struggling to adjust, fighting for every last detail of what was before me. Then like in the blink of an eye I beheld my visitor.

 It looked like a very tall bipedal bird like figure with very long plague doctor like ""beak"". Huge grapefruit sized black eyes that were more outside his face than they were inside. Sporting a slick black lab coat or duster fit for a Matrix movie. Bald head with curly white skullet, large raptor like hands and feet.

Upon witnessing the entity I became overwhelmed with terror and passed out from shock.....

 I awoke suddenly again and remembered very quickly of what had just happened.  I was still paralyzed and began to scan the room with my eyes but did not see any gradients in the darkness. It's gone I thought. Then the entity stood up and backed away from my bed. It had it's face so close to mine that the darkness of the room I was scanning was actually its eyes so close to mine I could not tell.

The crippling fear returned in an instant and I felt like I was going to pass out again. At that moment it ""spoke"" to me. It sounded like a extremely low vibration that translated itself into English in my head, in real time.

 It called me by a name that was not my own. But I recognized this name as my own. A name that is not supported by our language. Once he had addressed me by this name all the feelings of fear ceased and I was overcome with a feeling of peace,love and safety. I then shifted into a alternate personality, the personality of the name I was being addressed by. I came to realize that this was the name of my soul, the name of the entity who is me occupying this human body. Turns out our terrestrial bodies and terrestrial names are just egos. Egos are like spaceships, vehicles for a special purpose of navigating the waters of eternity.

 At that moment I remembered a lot of stuff that I can't explain. I remembered that I was on a mission. Somehow my life was a planned injection into the system for some other goal that in the moment I remembered, but now I cannot. It explained to me that it could perceive the entire contents of my mind and could somehow tell that I was passionate and serious about helping my fellow man through the darkness. It said that on special occasions, like the one at hand they could interject in the process to communicate and/or help us. It said that I possessed a unique perceptive that I was to share with my peers.

 It explained that if I wanted to participate I would have to give my consent. It said that while they were allowed to make themselves known they could not truly interfere without my consent. It said that it had the power to make me believe anything was real, and that I did not have the ability to determine what was real and whats not. It asked if I wanted to continue.....

 I declined, becoming very suspicious that was a malicious entity. ""Needs my permission?"" sounds like deal with the devil kinda shit. I got spooked, declined its offer and it dispensary right before me.

I awoke suddenly to an empty room. No longer paralyzed. Reflecting on what just happened. I became sad. I thought to myself. ""Wow, that was your chance to learn something new, to participate in something beyond belief. I thought that was my one chance and I blew it because I was afraid. Lost in regrets I laid back down and tried to go back to sleep. Then BAM! It was back just like that, BAM! paralyzed again. ""Am I awake or dreaming God dammit!"" I was so confused.

 The entity reminded me of how it just said that it could see my entire mind/soul/self like I could see pages of a book or view information off a DVD. It knew of my sadness and regret. It said it came back to make the offer one last time. This time I gladly accepted. It seemed very pleased and with that all went black.

 I awoke suddenly......it was morning time. I got up, showered, got dressed, brushed my teeth and decided that I would take my mind off these events by offering to make pancakes for my family. As I was flipping the first round of flapjacks I felt the same presence that I felt in my episode. I laughed and blurted out ""I know your there"". Then I felt goofy because I realized my whole family was at the table behind my waiting on the pancakes. I turned around to see the entire breakfast scene was on pause. Straight up on pause. Like the steam from the food and everything. Freeze frame. And the entity was standing right there on the other side of the counter. It ""chuckled"" and said something patronizing like I was doing a good job and had a strong mind. That I was a ""tough nut to crack"" so to speak.

 With that I was thrust into drama after drama. Normal real life basic dramas. Home,school,work,what have you......and every single time I was blindsided with a freeze frame and a little banter from this entity. I realized my mind was on a treadmill. A telepathic anesthetic technique. It kept on saying how much fun he was having actually having to try to keep my mind from seeing what was truly at hand. But it was not entirely successful and I did see what was really happening from time to time. You see during this whole ""treadmill"" of events I was getting blasted with short sporadic visceral images of my situation.

I was in a large metal room, naked, strapped to a large metal table in T pose. The table rotated into a vertical position and I saw informant of me this entity along with other entities but they were smaller and acted like aids to the main entity. Like I said this ""scene"" was being violently peppered into the ""day dream treadmill"" instances. Aka the telepathic anesthetic was hiding me from seeing but I was still getting traumatic slivers of my situation.

 In this metal room the entity approached me with a large metal looking object. The apparatus was 3ft long about 2in in diameter with a slight curve. I was completely and utterly frozen with terror. It held up the apparatus and inserted it all the way into my mouth. I could feel the apparatus melt into small tendrils like lighting or tree growth pattern. Each tendril tip then locked into each rung of each strand of my DNA and was preforming  read/write operations. I blacked out.

 I awoke suddenly.....it was night time, the same night still. I felt relived to realize that it all must have been a nightmare. That is when I heard a knock at my door. It was my little sister. She said she heard me thrashing in bed and wanted to see if I was OK. I was telling her of everything that just ""happened"" she was looking at her phone the whole time seemingly not interested with kinda hurt my feelings. In that moment she asked if she could show my something. We were both sitting on my bed. She got up and stood in front of me and turned here phone screen to my face. The white light of the blank screen temporarily blinded me. In that moment in the faded dark image behind the light of the screen my sister's skin began ripping like a shirt on a body builder and out her came the 7ft figure that had been toying with me all night.

 That was when it happened. I realized in then that he was right. During the ""day dream loops"" and ""abduction"" stuff I had an underlying notion of disbelief. But the instance with my sister, being awake and talking to her. I literally thought that that was real life, that I was back to real life. But really the entity was just giving one last final blow in the stability of my perception of reality. It then asked once more if I cared to continue. I admitted to it that it was correct. I did in fact think that was real and it succeeded in proving that it indeed had the power it claimed to have. I submitted and said I would like to continue.

That is when it bent over. Our eyes now level, our gazes locked. I was slammed with a series of discrete images. All the images were from my perceptive doing various things but nothing about the images seemed to match my current situation in life. My bedroom, computer, set/setting. They were not memories........what were they? I awoke suddenly........it was the next day. All that crazy shit stuffed into a single night. I felt as I was gone from Earth for years, but is was just a single night. I got ready and left for my community collage. My first class of the day was drawing class. The teacher opened class with a basic exercise to get the class warmed up. She said ""Draw something interesting you saw in a dream"". I locked up with anxiety so bad I slammed my hands down to my desk frantically looking around expecting to get blindsided by the entity only to see the whole class staring back at me from the sound of me hitting my desk. Plus my expression must have been priceless! HaHa! It's been 13 years since that night.......or has it? I will literally never be able to tell the difference. But that was the gift I was given.

 To make no choice matter.

To have and yet lose yourself, until finally all reasons why are forgotten.

To live through ones own shadow. Mute and blinded, is to really see.

A lie to maintain equilibrium, to hold me in this dead realm - this last ever dream.

I'm the thought that never crossed my mind - disguised in the evident.

 I now no longer have a sense of real vs not real. It's all real. In fact the only thing that is truly impossible is to not exist. The proof of this fact that you already do exist. We will never cease to exist. The contents of our minds and the actions of our thoughts are just as valid as the ""material"" world. There is no prime mover but us. Having both fun and terrifying experiences, escaping repetition and boredom for the sake of not loosing grasp of ourselves during our eternal existence.

 Here is the kicker. Over the last 13 years sometimes I will have deja vu. But instead of the normal deja vu sensation of knowing this happened already but having no memory of it happening. I would instead have a deja vu that linked back to a memory of where I saw that image in the first place. It's always one of the images that I was slammed with by the entity at the end of my episode. And they always occur when I am making a important decision in life or was looking for guidance on what to read/study next..

I have been making decisions based on these ""memories"" and it has led me on a life path so filled with synchronicity that I'm ""tripping"" sober each and every day.

 I found DMT when I was 24 y.o and got the confirmation I was looking for. I have deja vu a lot while researching/studying physics and they have led me to a ton of new ideas. After 13 years of following this bread crumb trail of deja vu I now have a great life situation that I am thankful for and oddly enough plans for a new physics apparatus that might be the answer to interstellar and/or inter-dimensional and/or time travel. TOTALLY INSANE......I know.

 I turn 31 this year. And I have not for a single second been able to remove what I saw from my minds eye. That night is BURNED into me. This year I finished the plans for my machine and plan on starting the build later this year.

Observers: Myself (36yrs old) and my son (16yrs old)  Background of Observers: Both of us have no history of UFO sightings nor were we UFO/Alien believers prior to this occurrence. We have both been very hesitant to report as our experience didn't feel friendly, in fact, the best way to describe the feeling from this 'thing' would be ""purposefully intimidating"" and ""watchful"".

 Sidenote: We have had another encounter with this 'thing' post our first experience and we have also had, what I can only describe as, ""energy encounters"" as well that all won't be listed in this sighting description.

 *Sighting started January 1, 2020, just before midnight and went into January 2, 2020, after midnight.

 Full Sighting Description: It was just before midnight on January 1, 2020, when my son and I came home. We parked in our reserved parking space at our condo which is located on the top floor (open to the sky) of a six-story building. We were sitting in our car talking for a while (I was actually giving him a lecture for something that happened earlier that evening) when he pointed out this star in the sky. We recognized it as Sirius as it was larger than most stars, brighter, and flashed rainbow colors. He noticed that it was moving to the left and then disappearing only to reappear in the exact same location a few minutes later. When it reappeared the last time (I'm guestimating we had been observing it for about 30 min or so) it started moving again, except, this time it was slightly moving up and down, right and left, etc. I know this sounds weird, but we both said to each other that it felt like it knew we were watching it and it was watching us back. That's when it star! ted moving to the left again, in the same pattern as before, but this time it didn't disappear, it just kept moving. This was when we started to feel very uneasy. At one point, as it was moving to the left, it passed right under an airplane/aircraft (not sure how close they were in reality, but from our perspective, they looked fairly close). The plane was an obvious aircraft because it had the typical blinking lights on the wingtips, etc. Well, as soon as this 'star thing' moved under the plane, it immediately mimicked the airplane - the blinking wingtip lights, red flashing lights and all. It was at this moment when we both kind of freaked, like, this star just turned into an airplane - that's impossible, right? We both jumped out of our car in order to look up and follow its path. As soon as it passed the plane, it turned into 3 orbs (I hate using that term but it's the best way to describe it), then went to 2 orbs and then back to one solid light orb and it was moving t! hrough the air almost as if it was swimming. It's very hard to! describ e but almost as if it was doing the butterfly stroke - it moved very smoothly, like gliding, but with smooth wave-like patterns. Also to note, at this point, it was not far up in the sky. I'd compare it to the height of a private plane or helicopter, maybe. Eventually, it moved almost completely parallel to the rooftop (which was at a higher point than us as there are stairs from the parking rooftop that go up to the tennis courts and outdoor lounge area). So, to not lose track of it, we both darted across the parking deck and ran up the stairs to the tennis court. We still had it in our sight when it took a complete 90-degree turn in our direction. We weren't even talking to each other, it was absolutely freezing cold outside and terribly windy and we were just fixated on it. It was both scary and fascinating. It was like you couldn't take your eyes off of it. We're watching it go over us when it suddenly stops in place (above us, yet, in front of us) and a bright light com! es on and shines right at us and it's just hovering - no sound at all. The light was incredibly bright. Almost like a police spotlight that they shine in your back window if you get pulled over at night, but larger. It was completely blinding. I felt like it was trying to intimidate us. I completely freaked out and grabbed my son's jacket to get him to run away, but he didn't move at first. Then I literally yelled at him to ""f****** run"" (sorry for the language) and he snapped out of it and ran with me back down the stairs and into the car. We immediately took off down the parking deck while both yelling ""What the hell was that!"" We were both freaking out the whole way down while trying to confirm with each other what we both had just witnessed. We didn't even know where we were driving to but we knew we wanted to get far away from that location. At the time, I had been checking on a friend's dog while they were on vacation, so I decided that we would he! ad over to their house and just stay there for the evening. Th! e house was approximately 3 miles away. As soon as we took a right turn to the road their house is off of, a low flying aircraft was hovering tree-top level. It was the shape of a triangle with no base, but lights underneath. What's interesting is that I heard no noise, but my son says he heard a helicopter-like sound. I have no clue how we both were there and heard two different things. It felt like it was anticipating us turning onto that street as if it was waiting for us. That's when I completely lost it and started crying out of fear. We sped under it and kept driving and there was this overwhelming bad feeling/energy that was so thick in the air (it's so hard to explain). I felt like something bad was going to happen to us but I didn't know what. It felt like we were being stalked, watched, not wanted, and threatened. We kept driving (never stopping at my friend's house) and we had no clue where we were driving, just getting away. We drove to the main road and I recalled a hot! el that I figured we could park at as it's open 24 hours therefore it felt safer. This hotel was about another 2+ miles down the road. As soon as we made a right turn into the hotel parking lot, we both saw it at the same time and I stopped my car in place. There was a figure in the hallway window on the 5th floor of the hotel, just standing still with its arms in its pockets, facing us - completely unmoving. Please take note, that this is a hotel that's solely stayed at by business persons. It's an extremely quiet neighborhood, the hotel had maybe 1/3 occupancy as there were very few cars in the parking lot. The window that this thing was standing at faced absolutely nothing but this semi-empty parking lot. There is no site to see outside that hallway window, nor would I guess anyone could see much of the dark outside parking lot through the window with all the bright lights on in the hallways of this hotel. My son did snap a photo of this thing in the window from his iPho! ne that I will forward via email. We were probably stopped the! re for a bout 30 seconds just staring and the most awful feeling of dread came over the both of us. I literally felt the blood draining from my face. I have never been so scared in my life. We zoomed out of the parking lot and got to the left turn light at the intersection we turned around to see if it was still in the window and it turned facing its left (which we went back to that hotel days later to see what would have been on the thing's left side and it's just a wall). We take that left onto the main road again, now driving toward the nearest gas station when that same aircraft passes over us again. We pulled into the gas station and I immediately called my sister (who didn't pick up the phone) then I called my parents (who were both well into their sleep at this time) and told them everything that had just happened because we really thought something was going to happen to us that night and we wanted someone to know. My dad suggested going to a 24-hour diner (since we did not w! ant to go back to our house nor would we have been able to sleep) so I looked one up that was closest to us and we headed straight there ? never been to this diner before, it?s called Landmark Diner in Buckhead. After we arrived, we were handed menus and at the top of the menu, they have a big tagline that says, ?Where The Stars Meet At Night? ? Could this be a coincidence? Sure, but what are the odds? Then when my son went to use the restroom he came out and asked me to come into the men?s bathroom to see the light. There were several recessed light fixtures in the ceiling and they were all white except one that was flashing every color of the rainbow. I went and asked the manager why they had one light in the bathroom that flashes different colors and he asked me to show him. I did, and he said he never noticed that before and that maybe it needed to be replaced and was about to die (I have iPhone video footage of this light in the bathroom as well that I will forward ove! r via email). I was talking to my son at the diner and I was t! elling h im how weird this was as I had just seen this triangle-shaped craft in the clouds earlier that day when I was walking the dog. He asked me to describe it, I did and told him it was on the side grass entrance to the Whole Foods parking lot in Chamblee. He thought it was weird and crazy but we kept talking about everything else that had just taken place that night so it stayed more of a random coincidence-style 'side note' part of the conversation. The evening ended with us sleeping in our car in a 24-hour McDonald's parking lot for the following 2 nights because we didn?t want to go back to where we first witnessed this thing. That's how very real this was.

 Now jump forward around 6 months after this event took place... We seldom talk about it, not because it's not interesting but because there's nothing much to ever get out of the conversation - we're always left with unanswered questions so it becomes redundant to mull it over again and again. But this evening, we were both home and talking about something entirely different in the living room, when suddenly he relates something to the triangle thing I had mentioned back on Jan 2, that I had seen while walking the dog. I go to explain to him how weird it was and the details (it was huge and literally in the clouds but very visible) when he asked me, ""Nobody else saw it?"" I was thinking for a moment, and I was like, ""No, I guess not. Maybe? I wasn't really looking around though."" Then he asked me what dog I was walking over by the Whole Foods area. That was when we both kind of blankly stared at each other and we realized it at the same time. I don't know w! hy I would be walking ANY dog over by the Whole Foods location. That's a mile and a half down the road from us. I also don't remember what dog I was walking. I can't remember the exact time it took place or the most obvious part - why anyone wouldn't have seen this humongous flying triangle object in the clouds hovering over the parking lot. It couldn't have taken place. Period. And why did we not realize how ridiculous that was when I told him that same story that evening at the diner? Why did it take us 6 months to realize this is an impossibility? I can't even recall that entire day up until the point I picked up my son and we drove home and saw this thing. Now that I know my memory couldn't have happened, I don't know what to make of what I actually did do that day. We were both sitting there just kind of stunned and confused by the whole thing when our dog (an 80lb Rhodesian/Mastiff mix starts physically shaking and pacing back and forth whining. We got that overwhelmi! ng fearful feeling again just as we did the night of Jan 2nd, ! literall y goosebumps all over both of us. We're trying to tell my dog ""It's ok"" and figure out what's wrong when he gets on top of the couch literally balances himself on the very top, where you rest your head, and is shaking uncontrollably and refuses to get down. We've since had many blinking light issues, no just in our home, but many friends and family homes, in the car, etc. The light thing seems to be a semi-regular occurrence. The weird wave of energy that we will get at the exact same time that is absolutely identical to the energy that thing in the sky gave has happened about a handful of times over the last year and a half. There's a couple of other short instances when this has taken place that I won't go into more detail about at this time as this is already a very long description. I would be very interested to speak with someone who knows about these things. We both would be 100% willing to take lie detector tests, etc.

Im a night guard on my watch. I parked my car in the corner of the lot and looked up at the treeline on the low hill that makes up the far side (east) of the lot. Its a suburban area outside of Milwaukee. Im on a commercial lot on the highway,, lots of fast food and strip malls, i think there's residential further back from the road. Its not the middle of nowhere. At first I thought it was someone with a flashlight either on a walk or maybe looking to break into my building. People walk by on the street occasionally sometimes a car drives through but never up on the hill its wooded theres no road or sidewalk up there.

 Appearance: the coloring was off for a flashlight,l like a wierd combination of 2 kinds of bulbs. The color was bright white like LED headlights but had an orange halo glow like old streetlights and the glow slightly lit up the immediate trees. The bright white seemed to face one direction at a time but always perfectly angled the same way like it was staring at something constantly while the orange hue was slight but all directions. it was enough to light up trees behind it. I didn't hear it made any sound, though I was in my patrol car with the engine and air on.

 Movement: It moved back and forth too fast for anyone on foot and at either end it would abruptly stop, bounce slightly and reverse direction. The path took about 5 seconds to cover maybe 50-100 yards. I'm not sure how far away it was exactly but this is all within maybe 500 yards of me. Theres just not enough room back there to be any further you run into houses. But then it faded back into the trees out of sight, very slowly, about 20 seconds.

 I was trying to write it in my log when it reappeared at the edge of the treeline and shot up and down. Then it zipped southeast along the edge of the lot/treeline when it went behind my building and I lost sight. I added that to my log and drove around to see if I could spot it again but there was nothing. I drove around on patrol and saw nothing.

 Time stamp: First sighting was 21:34 and lasted less than 2 minutes, second was maybe 30 seconds with maybe 2 minutes in between but I looked away at times. Lost sight clock said 21:37, just before 21:38 I guess. Again I tried writing in the log as accurate as possible but that meant looking away.

 Drone possibility: it could possibly been a drone but it would have yo be an incredible skilled pilot to fly between trees at night. The 'spotlight' was fixed perfectly on one spot no matter how it moved except when it faded away. When it disappeared the spotlight dimmed a lot, like 80% of its brightness. I dont know how a drone has a spotlight that can aim so perfectly. It shot up and down too high too fast for a drone it was like a fireworks rocket for 100 ft up then just as fast down, with the 'spotlight' changing angles perfectly to stay on whatever target.

I did not see an Ufo but I was changed 20,5 months ago by what I think can only be some external power. This is serious and not a joke.

 In September 2019 I was a primary school teacher, content in my work, with good friends and a supportive family.

Then from one second to the other I was not able to sleep anymore, I do not mean sleep less or poorly but no sleep at all. I was not tired or exhausted, I was rather exactly the same all the time. I formed sentences about how people sleep non stop and I did not know to whom. I was and still am also unable to imagine anything. For example if you ask me to close my eyes and picture a tomato I am not able to do so or if you ask me to think of a desert island - I can not.

 After 11 days I reported my self into a psychiatry and the gave me sleeping pills, but although I got all different kinds of pills I never fell asleep. After a few days the psychiatrists asked me how I felt about my snoring roommate, about my parents being on holiday... Then I realised that I could and still can not feel anything anymore. My senses are all intact although I do not have a seductive awareness anymore - I am aware of anything all the time.

 I can not be destracted or distract myself from forming sentences about either how humans feel, sleep, act or about me telling humans about my situation.

 I am in the most terrible state and also consider myself being traped between life and death. Nothing no drug, medicine, alcohol has any effect on me apart from a narcoses I had. It does not even have any effect on me if I eat or drink. So I went without drinking and eating for 11 days in the hospital and as I have a written report nothing happened even my blood samples where ok. I am currently not eating for 5 weeks and I am not even losing weight.

 Please help me, I am desperatly looking for someone to do research on me and I know that this is no Ufo sighting but I am really sure this is connected.

 I am in contact with the parapsychological institute in Freiburg but so fare nobody could help me in any way.

I have found you because I was searching for alien contacts.

What I am going to write to you sounds really crazy and I am completly aware that the easiest answer would be that I have some kind of psychological issue and I would do anything to change my situation for any psychological disorder, but it is not. It would be very kind of you to read everything I write - I need all the help that anybody ever needed.

22 months ago I was happily working as a teacher in primary school. I was 38 years old, I was in a good and stable relationship and without any psychological disorders.

Then from one second to the other I was completly changed. The first thing I reported to my friends and doctors was that I was no longer able to sleep - I was not tired or exhausted - I was always on the same level wide awake and full of power, but I was not sleeping anymore. I was also nonstop forming sentences in my head about what humans do to sleep, how I should feel... After nine days and nights I went to a psychiatric clinic. They gave me all kinds of sleeping pills- without any results. They asked me to exhaust myself, so I ran 22 km. Afterwards I felt completly the same, not tired, not exhausted, no mussle cramps. The nurses reported that I was really always awake when they checked, but said that maybe I just had a light sleep and woke up every time somebody entered the room. That is not the case. I went into a sleeping labor and my brain scan showed that I was in deep sleep - but while I was talking to the nurse, fully aware that I was talking.

Then the psychiatrists asked me how I felt about my snoring roommate, how I felt about my boyfriend not visiting to much, about my parents being away... That was when I realized that I was and still am not able to feel anymore. Of course the psychiatrists thought that I supress feelings, but there is no reason for that, I have no traumatic experience, I felt really good before the change happened. To show that I am really not able to feel, I went bungeejumping with a pulse watch and a camera- I had a pulse of 70 before, while and during the jump. I can still read feelings of people, I always know how I should feel, but I am not able to feel anymore. Before I was changed I was no fan of horror movies because I would be easily scared, now somebody could be eaten alive next to me- I am not able to feel anything. I form nonstop sentences about how humans feel, how I felt before.

The next realisation came when my mother asked me to imagine something positive. I realised that I was and still am not able to visualise anything anymore. If you ask me for example to draw a lemonade, I can do that. If you ask me to close my eyes and picture one I can not do that, I can also not imagine I taste a lemonade, I can also not go with thoughts to a desert island for example. I know that I was able to do all that before I was changed, but with the change I even forgot how humans work. I just form sentences like: Humans can imagine they are on a desert island. This is how human minds work. Why can't I. I would even go so far and say that I do not have thoughts anymore. I do not have something that comes to my mind and goes or that I can put aside. I just have this nonstop forming of sentences and they are either about how humans work or about how I explain my state to humans.

I went to different psychiatric clinics, got all bodily functions checked. Nothing made a different for one second. For me every second is the same, running is the same as sitting, my body is in the same state all the time. The doctors gave me all kind of medicine, you could see that it went into my blood, but you could also see that it had no effect on me. They tried to stop these reporting about humans by giving me skills like biting on chillies or having a cold shower. I bit on chillies, had a cold shower and formed sentences about how humans feel when they bite on chillies and take cold showers. It is as impossible for me to stop forming these sentences as it is for humans to fly.

I took all mkind of therapies from pottery to dancing... and formed sentences that pottery has an effect on humans and that it has no effect on me. While doing pottery I was exactly like when I was lying on my bed.

It was and is such a terrible (without feeling, but not without pain) situation that I formed the sentence: I stop drinking and eating, then I will dye. So I stopped drinking and eating. The doctors and the clinic did not like it but agreed under the condition that they check my blood every three days and that I would start drinking if I changed and for example got hallizunations. Nothing happened - My bloodsamples were always the same, a always had spit in my mouth. I did not drink for 11 days and nothing happened. This is reported by the clinic. Of course the doctors thought I might maybe drink unconciously - but this is not the case. In the last 22 months there has not been any evidence that I do things that I can not recall - on the contrary. It is impossible to distract me. I am always completly concentrated because I do not have thoughts with which I can go elsewhere.

I know that everything I write sounds unbelievable and that psychological explanations seem to be more realistic and I am taking every pill, doing every therapie - but I know from the first second on that something unbelievable has happened to me.

I have never seen an alien, no alien has ever spoken to me, I have no idea what has changed me.

The things I know are that I am hold in the same state for 22 months, that nothing is able to get me out of this state, that I have no feelings, that I have no imagination anymore, that I do not have a subconciousness anymore - everything I do is a result of a full conciousness and if you ask me what I have done the last 22 months: I have formed sentences about how humans function, how they feel, how feelings work, how they sleep or sentences for humans: How I work now (just like in this email) non stop.

I have no idea why and for whom I form the sentences about how humans work. They are always in German or in English. I feel not pressured to form them, because I do not feel anything. It is just impossible to not form them. I do not feel anything when I form them.

It is as if I teach some other alien form of living about humans or about how humans work. It is also as if I tell them how human language works.

I really have no idea if anybody in this world can help me - nobody was able to help me for one second in the last 22 months and I have spent 16 months in good clinics.

Please take this serious there is something that is using me to know more about humans- and I am completly aware that this sounds like a crazy person speaking.

I have no idea if anthing can help me - I am caught between life and death, neither able to have one or the other.

I even took 100 sleeping pills (Promethazin- neuraxpharm 50mg)- I should be dead - I did not spit them out, I did not sleep - I just formed sentences about what should happen.

I am completly aware that if you respond your answer will probably be to look for a good psychiatrist, but of course I am und psychological supervision, but it has no effect on me - they can not help me and that is even what they are saying.

If you want to see how I was before I changed you can have a look at my facebook page, it really changed in a second.

I really need all the help that I can get and I really think there is a danger for mankind.

You can also show this mail to collegues who work on the topic of alien contact.

Thank you for reading this long mail.

I was driving down NC 421 headed East from Boone headed toward Wilkesboro on my way home from work. I was the only car on the road as far as I could see. As I was driving, off to the left of the road (right around the area of the Food Lion on Deep Gap on Old 421) was what looked like an extremely bright and close star. It looked almost ovular, like it was a band of light lying horizontal. I happened to notice it out of the corner of my eye, and I looked at it. Once I looked in its direction, it immediately dropped out of the sky in a perfect vertical drop,  as if it was propelling itself downward, much faster than if something was just falling from the sky. After it dropped down, it disappeared and I didn?t see anything else like it for the rest of my drive home. As I was replaying the sight of it, I was trying to think of something else that it could have been, like a floodlight in a construction zone falling off of a post, or a drone; but, I concluded that! the speed at which it was moving had to have been faster than the speed of an object falling due to gravity.

Firstly this isn't the first time I've been seeing this. It's a recurring event that I have accepted and now it's a regular part of my everyday life. Everyday right before the sun goes down I'm greeted usually with 1 coming into view then another but that's just the beginning. I have a total of at least a hundred upwards of over 200 that follow me everywhere I go. It sounds crazy I hate explaining it cause almost everyone thinks I'm delusional but I can see perfectly I have brilliant vision and depth perception. They are just over the trees at their highest and below the tree tops at their lowest. Just a few days ago I was watching ufo or uap videos on YouTube and saw the Albuquerque video of the white orbs in formation and then the orange one. Same exact white orbs that follow me also with the orange one. They appear in formation and they mimic the constellation. I have been greeted by the big dipper just right above when turning on my road when I'm pulling in at home. It sounds insane but this has been going on since early May. Up until I saw that video in NM I thought they were drones but I started to realize that's not the case and there's other things that's happened that I'm not gonna explain that support the uap theory and dismantle this drone hype that some are trying to convince is the majority of these sightings. I found an article about this lady who can communicate with different beings and I tried this and got a reaction. I failed to hear or receive or understand and communication but I did get 2 of them to descend below the trees at my house and the other was last night behind food Lion with the bigger orange colored orb, it also changed from orange to white back to orange then to red then back to orange. The first one at home I got to descend from what I could tell definitely wasn't a drone. Seen no propellers nor heard any. There was however a tiny glowing red dot or orb that aimlessly danced or orbited this thing with no recognizable pattern or destination. I'm hoping to discover the reason as to why I was chosen to be followed or watched by these things. They stay up until right before the sunrises and it doesn't matter where I go or how fast I go they have absolutely no difficulty finding or keeping up with me..

We were camped out on Assateague island on a trip and we were making a fire to cook some food about 9 or so at night. We were facing north looking at ocean city and beyond.. all of the sudden a bright light caught my eye, it looked like a fire in the sky. It was bright and pretty big.. it then started flying towards the ocean, the bright light went away and it looked like blinking dots of different colors flashing in random sequences. It then seemed to drift back toward where it started and land. After a while another one took off and a bright light shining again and it would go dimmer and it flew around for a bit up and down sometimes slower and then go faster ... It would go up and then it started flashing crazy color lights purples, violets indigos, every hue of purple, oranges , reds, like some sort of party strobe light. It was pretty big and then it went away.... We watched it for 30 minutes l this going on ... We stood there trying to make a meal over the fire but we couldn't even keep the fire going because we were so distracted by all of this taking place. The craft seemed to fly toward the ocean getting brighter again. The colors were shifting is rapidly and with no set pattern just random. Purples , red, orange , green, so many colors alternating from this glowing orb in the distance .. then something caught our eye and coming from the south now had flown over us, directly over us and pretty low and we could hear nothing. I could see the lights underneath and some circle shapes under this craft, about three lights and they lit up some circle shapes underneath the craft. This went on and off for an hour at least. After this craft flee overhead we were just absolutely stunned and in shock. After all seemed still for a while maybe 20 minutes, we saw another light facing north and another was circling around it as if they were doing some sort of dance. These UFOs looked like they were shape shifting , one second it is as huge white light like a fire, next it was blue dots flashing then all the colors and purples and oranges and pulsating. It was just out of this world , and whatever flew over us was flashing some colorful lights as well .","Secretary",2,5,"orb",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2022,2020,1,2,21,"Evening","South",1,0,0,1,0

I arrived home via Mom passenger Dad was driving a minivan Ford Aerostar if any of that matters. When returning home up a windy road where my dad worked next door, we were returning from food or something. I was the only one in the home with them and my Dad turns into the driveway. He says, ""what do you mean?"" Looking at me. I tell him see what I mean and ahead of us was a 7' to 8' being glowing bright white in what appeared to be an all white garment with its head flowing back protruding out as if it was the beings skull.

Very remote no one around to see a thing. I was playing Tony Hawks pro skater and turning it off at 2 and no it wasn't a visual hallucination. I saw this thing looking dead me through the doorframe. I remembered to myself that same being and thought this was it. I carefully pretend to see past it and go I am f'd I cut the light and lock the door.

A second light appeared, this one started following the first lights movement by tailing it closely. In unison, the lights ""dropped"" what looked like a flashing orbs. The flash was bright white. The orbs fell directly down from the lights, they did not follow light's trajectory. The orbs flashed five times and vanished. A third light appeared in the sky. All 3 lights sped off. There were 3 sonic booms.

It was a Sunday night and I had just got out of the shower and was getting ready to watch Walt Disney, when I looked out the window in the stair way going down stairs I saw it, I giant UFO. I ran down the stairs to the front door screaming, ""A UFO! A UFO! as I opened the door in my PJ's with my older sister yelling Get in her Jimmy! I think she thought I was lying or something and pulled away and got outside and was Screaming my head off to intentionally draw attention from neighbors and it worked. Doors began opening and people started to the street and followed me and we all just stood there looking up in amazement.
There were about 60 to 75 people in my neighborhood in Newburyport Ma., that all watched something very out of the ordinary and amazing in September or early October of 1975. It was 100% a UFO, Made no sound and watched it hover for about 25 to 40 minutes. This craft was Massive and appeared to rotate in place and also had what appeared to be bright luminescent Windows in about the middle of the craft that ran all the way around. When I tell you it was Massive - Think US Aircraft Carrier in the sky (about 800 - 1000ft long and a Hight of about 80 to 100ft). This was at the end of Dennette Drive and Turkey Hill Road that we all watched this and looked to be about 1 mile away at an elevation of about 600 to 700 ft off the ground. When the craft left it made no sound and was lightning fast on it's exit. I ran home and called the police and they thought I was making a crank call so I told them I would get my big brothers shot gun and shoot it down, the officer on the other end told me not to touch the gun and he'd dispatch a cruiser. The responding officers name was Wayne Hooper. He tried to tell us that it was a ""Helicopter towing a lighted banner over the High school stadium"". We all knew that was a line of BS because the high school was 6miles to the South East from where the craft was and Helicopter's don't tow banners unless they want to crash...not to mention Banners are not 1000' X 100'. The closest version of what we all saw was in a film release 2 years after the event, ""Close Encounters"" but the big difference was I don't remember and vast assortment of colored lights. The were some that were colored green and mauve perhaps some purple and blue but the big white lighted windows was what caught my attention, each window panel seemed to be long and rectangular with slanted ends. I was 9 years old when I saw this and can still remember everything like it was yesterday and I can tell you everyone that was there. Some of my neighbors grew up to become Ma.

Sighthing occurred in front of my apartment building.","New Brunswick","NJ","08901","United States","USA","Saw a UFo in the sky while waiting for food delivery.","Saw a UFo in the sky while waiting for food delivery.

After work, I arrived home around 5 PM. Felt extremely tired, watched a movie and fell asleep listening to some ambient music. Sometime after 11 PM, I woke up and felt very much hangry. So, I ordered a food delivery through the iPhone app. Fast forward about 30 minutes, and I got a notification. Which I assumed was the delivery being dropped downstairs. I had left the iPhone charging. When I heard the notification bell ring, I ran downstairs. Assuming that the food delivery had arrived. Except, it had not. I had jumped the gun and now found myself outside holding the door to my building in one hand, wondering if I should stay waiting outside or not. It was a bit cold but I was dressed warmly.

Then suddenly, as I stood there trying to make up my mind. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw this luminous rotating weird looking thing. Yes, a thing. Pardon me for using that wrecked word. But understand that we do not have a proper word in any language which would make you ""get it"" instantly. Anyhow, I saw this luminous object go behind the building which is partly facing my apartment building. I thought to myself; ""Why is that helicopter making no sound?"" I assumed as much because just a couple of blocks away from home sits one of them big hospitals in New Brunswick. So, I assumed that this rotating luminousity was a helicopter. But when it came out the other side of the building, I could see very clearly that it was no helicopter. It was a disk-shaped object.

Through the entire duration of this sighthing, I was always left wondering what I was looking at. And it really didn't matter how my brain would go about trying to make sense out of this object. The more I looked, the more baffled and confused I became. For starters, the object was very much ridiculous looking. But most importantly, it made absolutely zero sense whatsoever. The shape wasn't aerodynamic in any way. The luminosity was constantly swirling into a series of waves which would change in intensity as the colors would ripple into one another. There was a specific sequence in the color changing pattern. ""The waves"" would be first yellow then morph into orange, then into red and then go back to orange and then, into yellow again and so on. In the center, It was a pitch black round disk-like completely black structure. The whole thing was tilted at a 45 degree angle as it moved forward. A dark disc-like object with a surrounding perimeter which was a luminous mass of colorful rotation. An ever-swirling changing coloration. To add more intrigue, the object was slowly positioning itself as it moved forward and upwards, in an elliptical pattern. The trajectory wasn't affected in any shape or form by this repositioning. Last but not least, it didn't make any sound. And if it did it wasn't loud enough to be heard from my vantage point.","Sales Rep. / Management",1,1,"disk",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2020,2020,4,12,23,"Night","Northeast",1,0,0,0,0

Recount: I was watching for the comet neowise I believe it was, I came across a patch of sky blacked out in a perfect triangle. The edges of the shape refracted the stars, imagine chromatic aberration and distorted/difuesed stars that somehow stop existing past the edge while appearing curved into nothing. There was no noise.

There was no abnormalities aside from literally negative space where there should have been stars. I looked at the clock at 9:45 that night, look back at it and somehow it was 11:45. My attention to detail is extremely high ask my col from rotc, I dont miss details. Period. Not saying I was abducted but I am a loss of what I saw and my missing time. I have had Urinary issues since and the doctors are still trying to figure out what's wrong.

Similar to the missing time I experienced as a child when in the corn field with my father who's former Navy Nuclear Submariner and sister many years ago, no one was able to find me then I turned the corner and was found after a long time im told. I guess they like me if UAPs are the cuase. I do often get random I guess flashes or singular memory of looking at a short grey face with big black eyes but that could be just a memory from or movie or something thats stuck in my head but I dont know its all very confusing for me because I cant recall any movie ive seen like that. I get a fear emotion but like I wait to be told how it affects me at the same time like hesitant emotional response. Its rare i have that kind of memory and I am doing my best to avoide sounding like a conspiracy nut but its the truth.

I am reporting this to my government because it's my responsibility to as a citizen and a patriot to provide my government with intelligence although it be late. Late due to me not wanting to sound or appear a nut as well as not wanting to waste my governments time with inactionable intelligence. I love science, facts are food. Beale Air Force base is located north east of event location within 30 miles I believe, it clearly evaded radar.

I got out of the car on the passenger side on the opposite side of the street of my house (left side) house being on the right. I had two hands full of food and soda as I closed the door with my hip. I had a lot of things in my hands so I was still standing in the exact spot when the car pulled away facing the opposite direction of my house. Checking pockets in case I forgot anything etc, as I began to turnaround a light caught my eye. I double take and look a third time and there was a perfect circle that was all light. More yellow than orange mostly yellow. I had a good 10 seconds to observe and confirm what my eyes were witnessing. It was far I could tell but it wasn?t in space it was in my sky about where the second layer would be. Though the skies were clear and it was night time about 10-11:00 PM. I had been seeing shooting stars and asteroids burn out in the atmosphere in space which had my attention so I would often look up at night. This night the ball of light stood completely still as I watched it just sit in the sky. It looked like a small sun yet it made nothing around it bright. As I looked left and right down my street there was no one to call to come and see the same as I saw. The second I looked back up the ball zoomed so fast downwards to the left and then to the right and then shot out so fast as I watched it fade by size into what looked like space. I was really excited and I regret not reporting that night as I did look for a number to report to.

I went out for a few minutes in my car to get fast food, and on my drive back home, I saw an orange light in the sky. It did not blink, but slightly pulsated. As far as size, it appeared slightly but noticably larger than stars and planets from my perspective. It moved slowly in the same direction as my car, then turned in an almost 90 degree angle, then turned again a few more times. I kept looking out my car windshield periodically until I arrived home and parked in front of my house. (The restaurant I went to is just about a minute away from my house). After I parked, I kept looking at the light from the driver's side window of my car, which was facing south. The light continued to move and change direction every few seconds. I saw that it was above the clouds, since clouds moving in front of it made it appear more hazy. (The next few sentences will sound cliche, and I understand, but it is the honest truth). I knew I had to get this sighting on camera. I frantically grabbed my phone, opened up the camera, and quickly looked back up to make sure it was there, but it had vanished. I got out of my car and looked up at the sky for a few minutes and scanned for the light, but I could not find it again.","Production Specialist",1,1,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2022,2020,2,6,21,"Evening","Northeast",1,0,1,0,0

On the evening of this occurrence, I was working in the Memphis Police Dispatch Office as one of the Shift Supervisors when a sighting of UFO?S was reported in the vicinity of the Memphis International Airport. I knew I would have an unobstructed view of the Airport from the roof of the building so I took my Police mobile radio and proceeded to the rooftop to see if I could observe any problems occurring at the Airport. While at the location observing in all directions, I did not observe any aircraft other than our planes (I?m also an aircraft mechanic, trained by the U.S.A.F. and I?m accustomed to seeing Aircraft of all types in flight). While standing there I happened to peer over the side of the Building and I was thinking ?how in the world could someone bring themselves to a point where they could launch themselves over the side of anything this tall to commit suicide.? As I was thinking about how it must feel to be falling through the space and time knowing all the time you are going to hit the ground. Suddenly, I was taken by a completely new sensation of which I have never before in my life experienced. I could literally feel the presence of another being near me. I looked into the direction of where I could feel this being and I was looking at about a 45-degree angle up into the darkness of the night toward the East, but I saw nothing. I could feel this being coming closer to me as if I could see it coming toward me, but there was nothing but darkness in the sky. As I stood there watching the sky and I felt another connection I have never felt, and that was like I could understand what someone else was thinking, and then I saw this small (between the size of a soccer ball and basketball) shinny sphere coming toward me that shinned brightly from the lights of the top of the Building Helicopter landing area but gave off no light or sound of its own. The sphere flew straight down at me and passed above my head about five feet away traveling maybe 2-3 MPH. (It felt so close that I felt like I could reach out and touch it.) I could feel some sort of mental connection between that thing and myself that I have never experienced before. It felt so strange that I can?t fully explain it even today. It flew past me and upward where I could still see it traveling toward the 100 N. Main Building and then turned sharply and was last seen traveling toward the part of the sky, I had observed it to originate from. I knew what this was as soon as I saw it coming toward me, as I have seen numerous of them in the past where there was death. I then realized that this UFO could read my mind and it must truly be a spirit catcher. I have seen these flying objects many times and as I say there was always death. The most chilling time that I observed them was unfortunately, the worst, and saddest time, for America. If you go back and observe the attack on the twin towers in NY, and watch when the cameras are pointed at the smoke rising from the tops of the towers, you will see these bright shinny orbs flying into the smoke-filled sky above the towers and you will see bright colored flashes emerge from them multiple times on every pass through the smoke-filled sky. They are catching the spirits of the dead. That my friend, is the simple truth of what they are. Aliens have been traveling through the cosmos for more than 5000 years. They were flying their ships probably before mankind was even on this earth. They have stood by all the time humans have polluted and almost destroyed the earth and all the seas and filled the heavens with debris from our space ships, not to mention the debris we have deposited on this earth. Yet, they keep their distance. They leave us alone to do our thing. They are not human, not like you, don?t breathe the air, don?t consume the same thing as you, well, maybe, uh, if you consume blood, well ok, they do also. They are not subject to the forces of gravity, and there is a reason for that as, they would not be able to stand the G forces that would instantly kill a human being. Really, they are more like an inter-dimensional being than anything else.
Let me explain what I mean when I say they are spirit catchers. Everything that exist contains energy. We may not understand this energy, be it Sub-Atomic particles or another totally different energy, yet there is energy there. The human spirit is energy. The human body is run by energy. When you die that energy that runs the body is gone. Your spirit energy is not. It goes out of the body. Where, well, I don?t know, but it goes out. Perhaps a depiction will give you insight. I?m giving you food for knowledge so, what the hell, I might as well give you everything. I?m providing a photograph that is totally untouched. It is a picture of something I witnessed while I was setting up some CCTV cameras. This system was only a few months old and functioning perfectly when I was using it and while I was setting a camera and watching the screen, I observed something travel out of the side of a hill of ground and travel about 18 inches off the ground at about 35-40 MPH for 50-60 feet and turn downward and go directly into the asphalt of the parking lot. I went back on the video and found that the object was traveling so quickly that it was only captured on one frame of the video. Well, I?ll tell you that I have never seen anything like this. The sun was directly in the front of the camera, yet the object cast no shadow. You can see those two beings, one on right you can see through, and one on left you cannot see through, ridding on some sort of jet powered sled with jets on the bottom rear. If you look closely, you can see one jet is giving off smoke. You make up your own mind. I?m not going to fill you with my thoughts on this one but, this is what I mean by inter-dimensional being. Blow it up on a big screen and make your own determination. Now, come to the reality that there are other dimensions to this world and we are not alone in the cosmos.

Context: I was a 21 year old enlisted soldier taking part in the U.S. Army Special Forces Forces and selection program. We conduct different physical events to select candidates for the green berets. This event is called land navigation. You have to traverse accross a large plot of terrain in cover of darkness with a rucksack, rifle, map, compass, protractor, food and water all by yourself. The objective is to find these point on a map, 6-15 miles apart, Lastly, I KNOW what differnt aircrafts look and sound like both at night and during the day. I jumped out of them for a living both at night and day.

It's 2.am and I just began my trek to my first point maybe 2 hours ago. They set us out on this objective during zero moon illumination to make it more challenging for candidates. I'm sure that I was close to my first point which was my furthest at 8 miles or something because I could barely make out another candidate in the near distance so I just though ""He might be going to the same point""( we have to wear these orange vests around our rucksacks for our own safety so if you're around 20 feet from someone, even in the dark you can kind of make it out.) He then went through some trees so I was trying to catch up by running but I was tired and stopped to catch my breath and rest my back from the 50lbs ruck sack. I leaned downward to give my lower back a break then leaned up to readjust my rucksack and I noticed some type of white-lit marble in the night sky. Remember, there is no light anywhere, except the stars. So I'm try to gather what it was but I couldn't gauge the distance or the size because the light didn't cast on anything at all.

Like normally when you have a light shining from a helicopter for example, you can tell the size and how far away it is by the direction of the spot light being cast or the front lights of the aircraft. So this non-light casting bright sphere was so smoothly flying towards me and it struck me as odd by how smooth it was moving towards me. Again, I'm use to C-130, C-17, blackhawks, Chinooks.... So I know this is weird. But because it didn't cast a light, I did realize how much closer it was than I thought and couldn't make out the size. Currently my mental state is the same as anyone who has been doing cardo for over and hour, very alert, constantly hydrating with my canteens so I know I'm in my right mind. This whole scenario maybe lasted 10 seconds so far.

But then I realized I suddenly could hear myself say ""what is that?"" and the surrounding calm breeze. Normally it's pure chaos when an aircraft lands. So now I'm trying to rationalize, Maybe its a drone? ...No?

As it was about to be over head, but may above the treeline, suddenly it sped up and turned like how you would roll a marble on a bed sheet or something. it made like a hooked curve-like turn but very fast and without tilting or anything. like a fast ball rolling it's way through the sky. That freaked me out. ALL aircraft tilt as far as I know and drones have a very mechanical movement when they turn. So now I'm awake.

The nail in the coffin came when this thing turned and increased speeds to something I have never even seen again after that day. Remember, It's the darkest night of the month. I can see this non light-casting ball speed off past the horizon and tree line and cover the distance I just came from in under 10 seconds. I started freaking out trying to look and see if any other candidates were around so I quickly sprinted to where I thought I saw the other guy went and found them, because only 5 minutes had passed since I saw him. tried to tell someone and realized I sounded like an idiot. I kept thinking ""What do we(The army) have that can do that??! I have never seen that"" I asked around the camp with a hundred or so others. Some of which were more veteran than me nd they just kind of shrugged and looked at me like I was delirious. And unfortunately, these people also have to NOT vote to send you home as well. So I kept quiet ever since.

But the physics I saw and the physics I was used to as an experienced airborne soldier completely in his right mind and not giving a crap about aliens, knew that this was TOO different. And there was NO way, it wasn't extraterrestrial.

While camping with my 14 year old son and daschaund my son and I decided to do some stargazing. We were in great spirits, dancing around the campfire, running around in the dark , being silly and having fun . My son was taking photos of the stars about 50 feet away from me . I looked up at what my brain wanted to initially call a shooting star, then as I processed that that couldn?t be correct my thought turned to ?meteor shower? but my brain processed that that couldn?t be correct either . After about 15 seconds of initial sight I called to my son in a no nonsense tone to ?get over here? while pointing out the objects to him .

We watched together for at least a full two minutes as from south to north a perfect line of lights appeared one after another moving at speed and in a manner that was inappropriate for anything our minds could make sense of.
- The lights were perfectly spaced from one another and moved in a perfect line .
-The lights ?started? green in color but turned bright white . Not flashing , more like the green got so bright and intense it had to turn white.
- The lights were fast and moved at a speed comparable to shooting stars but never lost altitude or broke ?formation? in regards to the spacing of the lights in front or behind it.
-At any given point throughout the sighting 15 to 20 of these fast moving lights could be seen creating a perfect line across the sky, though their colors were not constant with one another.
-The individual lights appeared rectangular or maybe pill shaped.
-The manner in which the lights moved across the sky was just ?wrong.? I have a hard time articulating this . Aside from the speed and formation the lights ?floated? or could maybe be compared to the way something glides across smooth ice.
-the formation these lights created were so constant and symmetrical I still question if we saw many small objects or one absolutely immense one

My son took video of a small bit of our sighting though we can?t see the lights in the video. The North Star is visible and constant and it appears other stars burn bright enough every now and then to blink up in the video . In reality it was a very clear night with many stars present.

After watching the last light in the string of lights . My son and I sat down unspeaking and unable to take our eyes from the sky . The mood wasn?t silly anymore . I said my sons name and he replied ? I can?t talk about it . Maybe we can talk about it in the morning. Don?t talk about it.? This place that only 2 minutes ago had been so fun and free now felt ominous, filled with dread, and just unsafe.
We both got into our tent for about 30 seconds and I asked him ?do you want to be here ?? His eyes welled with tears and he replied ?we can?t be here.? We got out of the tent and started shoving things into bags in any way they would fit and quickly tearing down camp .
About 30 second into doing so our very friendly dog who had not made so much as a yip or whine the entire day turned toward the Southern woods and started fiercely growling, barring his teeth, and barking frantically while oddly tucking his tail between his legs . This is notable as anytime the dog goes into an alert position (which is super seldom) we joke about him going into show dog mode as generally his ears will just perk and his long slender body goes into a perfect symmetry with his tail tip and nose being in a super straight line . The dogs actions caused both my son and I to instinctively scream . We grabbed everything haphazardly to make our way to the car which was parked about a quarter mile away through isolated woods. Without thinking I ensured that I had our alarm whistle in my mouth and bear spray in my hand for the trek . I blew the whistle loudly about every 10 steps . We walked by our loaded food hanging system without even discussing stopping to retrieve it . That wasn?t an even an option at that point .

We reached the car without incident threw everything in and locked the doors immediately upon entering. It took about 20 minutes of driving before we spoke . When we did we both broke down sobbing. I tried to assure my son everything was fine , we were ok. He disagreed and pointed out our body position which I hadn?t realized was hunched, arms in as tightly as they would go , it was like we were trying to make ourselves as small as possible . We drove the 3 hours home arriving around 1:30 am stopping only once in a well lit parking lot to sit in the car and just breathe for awhile. Upon getting home , my son would not leave my presence even for me to use the bathroom and demanded that I sleep in his bed with him . Imagine under normal circumstances how awkward being a 14 year old boy watching your mom use the bathroom and sleep in your bed would be . That discomfort was nonexistent and instead replaced with the fear of being in any sense of the word ?alone.?

I realize the facts of the sighting are what?s measurable here . I expand beyond those because while we can tell you about the lights we saw , it was the sense of imminent danger, dread, and primal instinctive fear that they instilled in us and our dog that for me makes this experience so notable . We camp, hike, and backpack all the time. We love science and nature and logic . Maybe that plays into our reactions . What we saw defied all of those things and left us feeling very defenseless and unsafe . The occurrences of last night were by far the most terrifying of my entire life.

I was leaving Columbus heading down state route 23 going to Jackson Ohio. Before I got to Circleville I saw 3 lights in the sky. About 10 times bigger than a bright star. They had a washed out yellowish glow to them. I thought it was just bright stars or a good night for stars until they all shut off at the same time. I thought it was weird but just kinda shrugged it off as helicopters. Until I seen it again. So I just grabbed some food in Circleville and was on my way to Chillicothe then I saw them again! The very left lower one turned on first almost like it was signaling the others to turn on. So the other 2 turned on for a few seconds all then all of a sudden the 2 on the right (not the signal light) started shooting out 3-4 other equal sized lights! Both of them! Them the lights they shot out turned off and then a few seconds later they all shut off. I was freaking out I called my fiance then the UFO report agency. They couldn?t do anything over the phone but I tried my best to record it. My phone case makes it fuzzy and there is a lot of light pollution being on the high way so I couldn?t get good quality but when I was recording the signal light (very left) turned on. At this point I was in Chillicothe so the lights being a plane or cell tower was out of the question. Also it stayed pretty in line with stars so I drive about 45 minutes and they were still in the same spot! But as I was saying the left one turned on and for a few seconds it stayed on then it flickered for a few seconds acting like it was trying to get the other attention but nothing. Them about 4 minutes later it turned on the the middle one turned on for a few seconds but the third did not appear. They shut off and that was the last I seen of them.","Electrician",1,3,"circle",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2022,2020,3,8,21,"Evening","Midwest",1,0,0,0,0

On approximately 9/15/2022 I returned from an ER Visit for a minor infection on the bottom of my feet. As I had a conversation on the phone with a family member I noticed what at first was, for a split second, I am pretty sure some type of triangle UAP that morphed back into a comercial airliner on takeoff from the Orlando Metro West Southwest. It at first appeared to be cruising normally but as I continued to observe out of the corner of my eye it seemed abnormally slow and moving at tops at 50 to 70 mph in a bit of a haze on a clear night. I watched as it continued climbing between 750 and 1500 to 2000 ft and continued at a crawl. I am fairly certian I witnessed the aircraft through time dilation and reported as such in relation to the vector heading and time of 9:52 pm per a photograph to the FAA Atlanta regional overnight 24 hr aircraft interference/emergency line. The aircraft took actually almost 5 minutes to approach and cross the horizon and I now feel like I might be remebering a bit of missing time. Are time travelers interfering with our commercial aircraft like the movie Millennium? I don't know but this was not the first time I noticed strange craft that I think were cloaked as commercial airliners I think to move around in our air space in secret. One time in ~2015 I noticed a what at first apeared to be a commercial jet liner with lighted wing tips crawling just as slowly across the Orlando/Winter Park sky to the North West from Corrine Dr./Lake Druid with a strange disco ball like twinkling strobe behind the rudder that resembled the Close Encounters of the Third Kind craft where it interacted with the Keyboard Lights/Moog. Additionally I have seen twice giant flying wings display for a split second/second out of commercial aliners in the Orlando metro going back to 2012/2013 as I remember; one black with red lights on the wing tips and an metal superstructure underneath that must have been a mile wide the dimensions of a an ~165? boomerang and the other banked at a 90? ""screaming standing still"", basically, within displacing momentarily an aircraft on approach to OIA over approximately Winter Park/S.R. 436. In summary, this is a detailed description of my sighting as discussed/described by me on ~ Sept 15th since then that was witnessed from an open window in my car parked in my driveway in the Lockhart neighborhood/municipality in the Orlando Florida area on Tarpon Dr. facing north.

Additionally, about a month prior to Sept 1.5 on August 15 or so, of this year, my friend and I saw a faintly lighted commercial sized airliner doing a series of banked 90? turns over Lockhart to the east of Eatonville where we were picking up food in the drive through. I picked up on the fact that it flew silently and made no sound.

Lastly, three sightings from 2012 and ~ 2010.

1) In about 2012 I saw at night from cross town what I think was a commercial airliner fall out of the sky through ""a hole"" over roughly the sinkhole behind Austin Coffee and Film in Winter Park Florida. I drove over in a hurry expecting a crash and simply remember ""blacking out"" when I got their and their after I can only remember I went about hanging out instead of calling local authorities per my understanding of how of how to respond at the time.

2) In roughly 2010 my self and my buddy the artist Gavin Heron Venetta witnessed two commercial airliners in the same approximate position come within ~500ft of eachother in terms of altitude over Austin Coffee and Film where we used to hang out regularly before he passed back in roughly, per my perspective, in 2018 in a strange thick mist like daytime fog in~ 2010. Per my perspective it seemed like they came in from different dimensions in time as well.

3) I witnessed either an E.B.E. (ExtraTerrestrial Biological Entity) or an time traveler, kinda resembling the E.T. in the movie Battleship, stop time for a split second behind Austin Coffee and Film where a couple of people including myself stood in a circle to accept that one thing that you might do socially if you were offered, though I only took ""one puff"", before I saw it thrash and headbang in a background of static electricity lightning then leap into the sky as it appeared,

I was driving west leaving work. I was on highway 160 approaching Talisman drive.
I noticed very bright lights coming in a southeast direction. I Looked up to assume I would see an airplane. My thoughts were that craft is flying very low, that it would barely make it above the trees. And that it was so large it couldn't possibly land at our local airport. I also noted that it had no ""wings"" and no tail. There were about 6-8 white lights and one red on the craft's left side. And no detectable sound. It was very clear and distinct.
The craft was flying just above a local fast-food restaurant, and was larger than that building.
I stopped in my lane and watched it fly over my car. It disappeared when I looked in my rear-view mirror.
I have been looking in our town's newspaper for any reports of a large aircraft sighting. I have found none.
I am very curious and would like to hear your thoughts. I was in such awe I did not get a photo. I did however, look on Google and found a photo of what I recall seeing.

No attempt to conceal.

Setting: Driver of a vehicle, overcast, medium to light traffic, headed northbound recently passing the Hampton Coliseum (~exit 263).

I Saw(1): A massive ship ""moving slowly across all lanes of the highway just above the trees, slowly enough for me to observe the ship with great detail approaching it. I am pretty sure I was in a state of awe as I kept driving.

MAYBE Missing time: I was on a short timeline to meet my brother in Richmond. No planned stops (full gas) 1.5ish hr drive. I don't recall pulling over (I am the type of person that, when I drive, I don't like to stop if I don't have to)

I Saw (2): I am in a parking lot at a fast food restaurant (don't remember) in my vehicle (backed in a parking spot) just off of the highway I was just on. Not enough time to process until I immediately see the ship again, and I am put into another state of awe. It's just over the highway still where I need to go. I remember getting back on the highway and eventually passing under the ship.

I was able to get an extremely good look at the underside of the craft (huge ship) while leaning forwarding looking up through my windshield. The craft was so long you could not see end to end of the ship when it was perpendicular to the highway from my vantage point.

The odd thing is I remember seeing the ship from two very different angles. The first sighting occurred after just passing the Hampton Coliseum, and again while in my parked vehicle at a fast-food place (I didn't have food in the vehicle) on a trip I never make a stop on. I am not sure if the gap in time was just from my inability to process the situation or if I simply pulled over in shock.

I have a Garmin Dashcam. I remember trying to have it recorded but it was not responding to my commands. No footage was saved when I checked the SD Card.

Ship description: (A VERY similar ship that I could say it looks like is the Arbitrator, from EVE Online... Seriously). Had characteristics of a V but not the flying V you can find in popular UFO google searches)
-Green, red, and sometimes blue flashing lights.
-Red ""under-dome""
-Metal plating, clayish to rust color.
-Piping and cables were black and situated behind the plating
-exposed ""intricacies"" between the ""gapped"" outer plating
-Silent
-It's movement in the air was ""glitchy""

It was around 5-5:30 in which my family and I (my father and eldest sibling) were heading out to pick up some Afghan food in Dublin/Livermore. We headed out via Camino Tassajara Road (Country side region) where we passed Tassajara Hills Elementary School and the soccer stadium nearby, as reference markers.

A few minutes later, while listening to music, I looked to my left and saw a stationary object of pure light hovering at a high altitude. Note too, there was a radio on with my family members talking, but neither was too loud to completely overwhelm my senses. Regardless, no obvious sound, movement, or even the common ?position lights? of common aircraft were apparent ? non-existent. I recorded this object for around 43 seconds, but had my eyes on it some seconds more prior. Even when I wasn?t recording and looked with my naked eye, I could tell there was no movement whatsoever. In regards to the video, it is wobbly given the rough, hilly road, so I do apologize for that, but hope it helps.

Now first and foremost, I must inform whoever sees this: there are no signal towers that are of that altitude, nor multiple in the distance that could breach these clouds, or be apparent (usually ?dim? but still noticeable, however, not like this), no position lights, thus no aircraft, nonetheless, seemed ?odd?. Usually you can see a dark dot to indicate a general idea of form, with objects of our knowledge in this time of day (while being overcast, there was a good portion of light left). While some may rule this out as a helicopter, signal tower, etc, none seem viable.

Any grammar, tonal or spelling mistakes, forgive me, since I?m very tired at the moment. Any questions, always welcome to contact me.

I had just got home and was in the process of getting some food for my dog when i noticed this glowing orange light moving across the night sky. There were no clouds, and the stars were out in number, very crisp and clear night. It seemed rather low, this light, and at the speed it was travelling I took it for a helicopter with a search light on, which is nonsense, there was no beam of light as a search light would give off, they are not orange, but that was my first thought. I expected to see some kind of outline of a helicopter and waited for some noise, but nothing was presented. Total silence, which is what really made me take pause. The sphere then ascended, its movement more like floating rather than something propelled. As it rose, it seemed to lengthen out, the orange ball became more stretched out into a ovular shape. At this point, it stopped moving for about ten seconds then the orange light went out from the front to the back and was replaced with a fuzzy whitish blue. It popped, or split in half, the orange light returned for the front with a kind of fuzz or blur with it, and remained still, while the other light, the back part, took off away from where it had been blinking and white. This continued for a few seconds, and it seemed almost at times like I was watching an optical illusion, as if they would look like they were coming towards me then they were right back where they were, simmering and elastic, then they both completely disappeared. That?s it, I didn?t just come from the bar, and im not on any drugs, just a random crazy thing that left me quite perplexed and man, its movement was so fluid and graceful, really something else.

The color of the lights were a bright white light. The lights glowed on and off, on and off, then off and I can almost still see it before it disappeared.

UFO SWARM OBSERVED OVER MADISON COUNTY, SOUTHEAST MISSOURI, USA

William Jud, Geologist, Author
14 December 2022

I had been complaining of boredom because nothing interesting was going on.

That changed on Saturday night, 22 October 2022.

? Around 9:00 p.m. my neighbor started banging on my door. A forest fire was approaching and I needed to evacuate.

? The Cherokee Pass Rural Fire Department had already arrived. US Forest Service and Missouri Conservation firefighters also came. Two bulldozers and several firefighters with leaf blowers started work. By the time the fire was contained, the fire was just 500 feet from my house.

? We went to the neighbor's house and sat on the porch, talking, and watching the stars. Some of the stars were moving erratically. Some were flashing on and off and changing color. Stars don't move that way. They weren't stars. They were not aircraft. They were not satellites. They were a UFO swarm. Twelve of them.

Yes, real UFOs. Real, legitimate UFOs. Doing what UFOs are famous for doing.

Parked unmoving in the sky, then immense acceleration, then an abrupt stop. Moving across as much as 5 degrees of sky in one second and one jump.

One bright red UFO zoomed across 15 degrees of sky in about 10 seconds and appeared to stop and hover in the vicinity of Marquand. That UFO resembled Mars but was larger and much brighter.

Three or four airplanes crossed the sky, moving in straight lines, at a constant speed, with red and white blinking identification lights. Completely normal airplane behavior. Not UFOs. No confusion.

There were islands of scattered clouds internally mixed with areas of open sky. Airplanes crossing the cloud islands disappeared behind the clouds and reappeared across the patches of open sky. Some moving UFOs dimmed but did not disappear when crossing the cloud islands, suggesting that the UFOs were flying within or under the clouds, and offering an estimate of flight altitude.

One bright white UFO displayed a surrounding cluster of several smaller satellite lights, some blinking, some constant, and some with white, blue, and red changing colors. My neighbor got still photos and video motion pictures on his telephone camera. The video recording does show some detail under magnification, displaying a 4-armed cross, +, extending top - bottom - left - right from the central UFO body.

No sound was noticed, but the UFOs were high up and miles away, probably too far for any sound to be heard.

UFO sightings records go back thousands of years, are shown in ancient petroglyphs in the southwestern States, and are mentioned (by interpretation) in the Bible, Quran, and other historical documents. Those UFOs come in two flavors: Solid Material UFOs, and Energy Projection UFOs.

UFOs made of solid physical material must (as far as we know) obey Newton's 2nd Law of Motion: Force = Mass x Acceleration.

UFOs made of solid material, probably Mothership types, would instantly break apart if doing the extreme start-stop changes in speed and instant, high-speed, zero-radius turns for which UFOs are famous. Living creatures onboard would go SPLAT against a hard surface.

UFOs that are Energy Projections, advanced HOLOGRAMS, are not limited by Newton's 2nd Law because photons have no mass, so Newton's equation reads Force = zero x Acceleration, or Zero Force.

An example is a Photon Energy Beam from a flashlight shining a spot of light onto a wall. You can move and shake the flashlight as fast as you want and the moving light spot on the wall will not influence the flashlight. Light photons are massless. Newton's 2nd Law equation equals zero.

Probable Energy Projection UFOs have been seen entering the water without making a SPLASH. A solid UFO definitely would make a VERY BIG SPLASH. An Energy Projection UFO would not disturb water any more than shining a flashlight beam into the water.

Now there may be a third category of UFO, and that has the US Department of Defense worried. About 500 really smart people at DoD, NASA, Harvard University, and several others, currently are studying UFOs to determine whether some modern UFOs might be homegrown, that is, built by US adversaries. Those worrisome UFOs include conventional drone aircraft and also functional reproductions of traditional (space alien?) UFOs.

Solid material UFOs crash occasionally. What if a UFO crashed in China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, and the scientists and engineers took the UFO apart, found out how it works, and built a fleet of UFOs to be loaded with thermonuclear weapons ('Hydrogen bombs') and flown into American skies when the opportunity arises? Not as far-fetched as it may seem, and our National Security people are investigating.

Our adversaries could create an artificial Carrington Event like the intense, natural, Solar Coronal Mass Ejection that hit Earth on 1?2 September 1859 and caused widespread damage to the national electrical and telegraph systems in North America and Europe.

Simultaneously detonate 50 evenly spaced H-bombs over North America at 50 to 100 miles above the ground and everything electronic or electrical is instantly destroyed by a giant electromagnetic pulse, including all the electrical generation and transmission equipment. Instant return to the Stone Age. Way more than 99% fatalities. Do you understand why the Department of Defense is concerned? Can you live in the modern world without electricity? No water. No food. Nothing. Maybe you will survive two to four weeks, tops.

If DoD and NASA are interested, I'm interested.

An exciting night. I have long wanted to see a UFO. Saturday night I saw 12 UFOs, plus the danger of a forest fire that came within the width of a gnat's eyebrow from destroying my house.

Were UFO swarms seen at other locations that night along the 37-38 degrees north latitude ""Paranormal Freeway""? Do UFO swarms often happen in southeast Missouri? (Recently, yes, they do.) Is there a geological connection? Does this mean anything?

Look at the sky next time you are outside on a clear, very dark, Moonless night.

Some of the lights in the sky may not be stars.

Stay tuned.

Second Article:

HOW DOES A UFO SURVIVE ITS OWN VIOLENT MOVEMENTS?

William Jud, Geologist, Author
14 January 2023 Updated 30 March 2023

There is a simple answer after a change of assumption. That is, many (emphasis!!!! NOT ALL) UFOs are not solid objects. Some UFOs are ENERGY PROJECTIONS with ZERO MASS. Advanced HOLOGRAMS.

Isaac Newton solved the UFO violent movements survival problem in the year 1687 with his 2nd Law Of Motion: (INERTIAL) FORCE = MASS x ACCELERATION. Let MASS = ZERO and it all makes sense. ""Inertial"" Force is created by a Change of Speed, not by Speed itself. Inertial Force is how a hammer drives a nail.

Repeating for emphasis: Some, not all, UFOs appear to be ENERGY PROJECTIONS, not SOLID PHYSICAL OBJECTS.

You get ZERO INERTIAL FORCE by replacing the MASS item in the equation with ENERGY. Yes, that is allowed. You want to keep ENERGY and make MASS equal ZERO. Observed UFO electromagnetic radiation and movement require Energy, which has Zero Mass. The Energy component can be any quantity and intensity.

This does NOT mean you multiply ENERGY x ACCELERATION for an Energy Projection UFO. When you change the UFO Conceptual Model from a SOLID UFO to an ENERGY PROJECTION UFO, the MASS component automatically becomes ZERO. Newton's original equation still applies/

Solid UFO 'Motherships', and Energy Projection 'Hologram UFOs', are different entities with different construction and abilities, serving different purposes.

A generalized and not totally accurate Navy ship analogy is, the solid Mothership UFO is an Aircraft Carrier and Holographic UFOs are the airplanes. Holographic UFOs, and a Holographic crew and other occupants if appropriate, are created (and erased) as needed and do not require feeding, equipment storage, maintenance, and support space on the Mothership.

Going off-topic for a moment, the basic Holographic UFO premise probably also applies to other Paranormal phenomena such as Ghosts and Dragons that share operational characteristics with Energy Projection UFOs. Think of a movie theater. The projection equipment will project any visual material loaded into the projector. Projection equipment powerful and advanced enough to project realistic Holographic UFOs would have no problem projecting other Paranormal images such as ghosts, Thunderbirds, and dragons, and even Angels. Have you seen the big wall chart illustrating a hundred or more varieties of UFOs? Are there really that many different UFO Models? It would be much simpler to have just a few standard operating Models and the rest could be nonfunctional projected drawings much like a cast of cartoon characters. Projected image size, color, lights, shape, sound, and other operational components could be adjusted. The same projected UFO Model image could be five feet wide or the size of several football fields. Effectively, a Galactic PHOTOSHOP. Is there a commonality of origin? Who or What is running the Projector, and for what purpose?

Energy Projection UFOs allow the MASS term in Newton's 2nd Law to be ZERO because ENERGY has no MASS. Holographic UFOs are observed to NOT self-destruct from the Inertial Force that might be expected to, but does not, accompany their signature Violent Acceleration movements.

UFO survival is observed. UFO violent acceleration movements are observed. UFOs move and emit light, both of which are energy forms. For observed survival of violent UFO activity to happen, Energy must replace Mass in Newton's equation. Energy can be any intensity. Acceleration can be any intensity. Mass must equal Zero.

Newton's 2nd Law still applies in original form, but for Energy Projection UFOs, MASS now equals Zero. Zero times anything is Zero. Inertial Force is Zero. That suggests those UFOs are very advanced HOLOGRAMS, not solid spacecraft.

If Mass = Zero, then Force = Zero, and Acceleration can have any value WHATEVER without creating the INERTIAL FORCE that would tear apart a solid UFO. Abrupt changes in speed, + or -, (Acceleration), and zero-radius turns at high speed, have no effect on an Energy Projection UFO.

Newton's 2nd Law of Motion also implies that some, not all, UFOs do not contain solid matter internally. An airplane might fly through a UFO and not collide with anything solid.

But beware! Energy density could be, and probably is, INTENSE inside an ENERGY PROJECTION UFO. The airplane might not crash into anything solid during UFO transit, but may exit the UFO in a MOLTEN state or even as PLASMA.

The invading human metal aircraft very likely will blow a fuse in the MOTHERSHIP UFO (or other source) projecting the Energy Beam, and who knows what that might cause? At least the short circuit will alert the Mothership crew (whatever that may be) of an unusual event that requires attention. Could be a really bad outcome for humans, or maybe the operator (living or AI) will just put a new fuse in the control panel and continue operating as usual.

UFOs have been seen and reported on Earth for tens of thousands of years. UFO images created 25,000 years ago appear in ancient Petroglyphs in our U.S. southwestern States. UFOs and their Alien occupants are mentioned (by interpretation) abundantly in the Bible, are mentioned in the Quran, and appear in early writing from the age of Egyptian Pharaohs. Humans are hardwired to worship phenomena they do not understand.

Here is a very short list of common UFO-related observations that argue for some, not all, UFOs to be Zero Mass Energy Projections. ENERGY PROJECTION UFOs would display these qualities during normal operations. SOLID UFOs generally would not.

? The signature movement of many UFOs is EXTREMELY RAPID stop-move-stop linear acceleration that can instantly change from parked to movement at hundreds to thousands of miles per hour and then instantly back to a full stop. UFOs are often seen doing zero-radius turns at high speed. These movements would generate HUGE INERTIAL FORCE in a solid object that would tear the object apart and make living creatures onboard go SPLAT against a solid surface. An ENERGY PROJECTION UFO with ZERO MASS would not be thus affected.

? UFOs do not display aerodynamic control surfaces. An Energy Projection UFO would not need them. No wings. No evidence of an engine or other energy source for powered flight. No hot exhaust trail. No engine sound. No SONIC BOOM even when moving at hundreds to thousands of miles per hour. UFOs can move against the wind, even at high altitudes where wind speeds commonly exceed a hundred miles per hour. A zero mass ENERGY PROJECTION UFO would not be influenced by wind any more than a Photon Energy Light Beam from a flashlight is blown around on a windy night.

? UFOs that drop out of the sky and enter the water do not SPLASH going in or going out and may cruise around at a shallow depth underwater without disturbing the surface. A SOLID UFO that moved that way would make a HUGE SPLASH and stir up BIG WAVES.

? A UFO can suddenly appear in empty sky, suddenly disappear, move to another location, and appear again, as though a controlling entity were turning a switch ON and then OFF. It also is possible that a visible Energy Projection UFO (and occupants) could shift to an electromagnetic frequency, + or -, outside the range of visible light. The UFO would still be there. You just could not see it. An Energy Projection UFO operating ONLY in the visible spectrum could help explain why the UFO is visible to people but does not appear on RADAR. Why do (some?) UFOs have lights, anyway? Is visible light just a byproduct of operation, much like exhaust from an engine? Or do some UFOs want humans to see UFOs, and for what reason?

? An ENERGY PROJECTION UFO with ZERO MASS would not be affected by GRAVITY and could hover in place without needing energy input to maintain position. This is different from FLOATING as done by lighter-than-air craft which depends on difference in density with the surrounding air.

? In many photographs, the background is normal but the UFO is grainy and poorly focused. A solid UFO would have a sharper image.

There's a lot more, but you get the idea. Some, but not all, UFOs act like ENERGY PROJECTIONS, not SOLID OBJECTS. They resemble holograms, and they are certainly much more advanced, but are functionally and conceptually similar, to Drone Aircraft now in common use. Energy Projection UFOs probably are scouts, sample collectors, cowboys, veterinarians, messengers, or data gatherers, sent by a Mothership or equivalent.
--------------------------------------
A document reviewer asked a very important question: ""How does an ENERGY PROJECTION UFO work?""

Answer: I don't know how remote-control UFO manifestation works, but UFO behavior shows that it does work.

Striking a match is similar. You begin with a cold match, strike the match, and make fire. No need to know any of the Physics, Chemistry, or even Quantum Mechanics involved. You just do it and you see the result. You made fire.

As noted, UFO behavior in many instances requires non-solid, zero mass, to do what is observed. It happened, so there was a way for the event to happen, and that does not depend on our understanding of the mechanism.

Additionally, pilots and other people who have close contact with a UFO for several minutes often report radiation burns and other injuries, probably from exposure to strong microwaves. Is primary radiation emitted by the operating UFO, or is the radiation surrounding a UFO spillover from the energy transmission beam that powers the UFO and is wider than the part of the beam that the UFO absorbed? Either way, you could be burned or otherwise injured by close contact longer than a very few minutes.

Unexplained pregnancy is also reported after close contact with a UFO.
------------------------------
How to test the ENERGY PROJECTION UFOs idea (in the rather unlikely event that the UFO cooperates)?

UFOs seem able to outrun all conventional aircraft and may be able to lock onto and maintain constant separation and position from aircraft. That would make testing a wild UFO very difficult. UFOs ARE US doesn't do rentals.

Well, a first step might be to consider an airborne UFO as occupying the center of a sphere a thousand feet or so in radius. Load a jet fighter aircraft or helicopter (depending on UFO speed) with an assemblage of instruments that measure and record gravity, magnetism, full-spectrum electromagnetic radiation, full-spectrum infrared to gamma ray photon radiation, temperature, high-frequency 'dog whistle' sound, and other sensors. For a UFO that landed or is hovering almost at ground level use the same testing equipment transported by helicopter or truck. In all cases, this is a risky operation because UFOs are known to shut down engines in nearby vehicles and could cause the aircraft to crash.

Fly the airplane in a spherical or cylindrical path around the UFO and see if anything is detected. An abrupt increase in energy in one area could mean you found the Energy Projection beam linking the UFO and Mothership.

Similarly equipped mobile laboratories that can be quickly sent, preferably by pickup truck or helicopter, to a semi-permanent ground location experiencing ongoing UFO activity (such as Piedmont, Missouri, USA), could record even more data.

A network of low-tech backyard UFO Detectors, cheap and easy to build but limited in sensitivity, could track the arrival and disappearance of UFOs and their flight paths. If a backyard UFO detector cost $500 to build and install, 2,000 of them as a regional network could be put in place for $1,000,000. It is possible that an old Analog (pre-digital) television set could be tuned to receive and display a useful generated or reflected signal that would indicate nearby UFO activity.

Data acquisition provides the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. The fun part is data interpretation. Don't be embarrassed. Be really, really, CREATIVE.

What does this all mean? Are Alien living beings involved? Artificial Intelligence beings? Galactic Tourist Cruise Ships? Did an ancient Alien race set this up, move on, and forget to switch off the power before leaving? Are we a Galactic Bio-Preserve and UFOs are the equivalent of Whale Watching Cruise Boats?

Is there a Geological UFO attraction? UFOs are common in southeast Missouri, USA, above a Gravity-interpreted Precambrian Asteroid Impact Structure 120 miles in diameter. The impact of an Asteroid estimated to have been 10 to 12 miles wide blasted completely through the Crust into the upper Mantle Asthenosphere, started a Mantle Plume that caused eruption of the St. Francois Volcanic Terrain, and emplaced still-buried igneous rocks enriched with Iron Oxide minerals. Just coincidence? Or is the interpreted Impact Structure an attractant causing the frequently observed regional UFO activity? The center of Asteroid impact is Reynolds County, Carter County, and at Piedmont in western Wayne County, and is a known, UFO activity-rich area. Adjacent Madison County, Missouri, appears to be a UFO Highway but not a destination. UFOs pass by overhead but have not recently been observed to land. There are more large Impact Structures around the world. Is there increased UFO activity at the other Impact sites?

? Possible Precambrian Asteroid Impact Structure Document at top of the page.
? Crustal architecture beneath the southern Midcontinent (USA) Document at bottom of page mentions iron mineralization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are we livestock? We do seem to be a biological experiment similar to improving cattle breeds. Are UFOs Cowboys ""Riding The Range"" and looking after the herd? When is the Roundup and drive to market going to happen?

What have UFOs been doing here for the past 25,000+ documented years and what is their End Game?

Is this all a Computer Game Tournament and the players will turn off the simulation program when the Winner finds out we know what they are doing? Possibilities abound!

Reverse Engineering research is a good way to begin investigation of something poorly understood. If an event happened or a device exists there was a cause and is a data trail. Start at 'now' and work back toward the beginning. Geologists commonly do this during exploration for Natural Resources.

Dig into modern and historical records describing UFO Behavior. Include reports of Paranormal manifestations that can't be explained by science, including mythical monsters and their adversaries such as Hercules and the Hydra. Might such tales recount events that seemed very real to the participants and observers, but actually were high-quality Holographic projections? What was their purpose?

When you exhaust historical human records and myths begin searching Paleontology. Be really creative. Was the Cretaceous Asteroid impact that killed the Dinosaurs an accident or a deliberate act to promote the rise of mammals, eventually evolving Humans instead of Lizard People? There are plenty of big Space Rocks in the ASTEROID BELT between Jupiter and Mars. UFOs had enough time to do Asteroid orbital adjustment and probably the means to do that. Earth's future location is completely predictable for targeting. Were the Geologically rather sudden appearances of shelled organisms, trilobites, fish, land plants, insects, and other life forms due only to natural evolution, or did an overseeing entity participate, and how, and why?

The farther back in time, the more tenuous the potential associations. Cast your largest possible metaphorical information net, then sort your catch.

Most of that data and apparent associations will be dead ends, but look very carefully. There might be a diamond or two in that pile of intellectual gravel.

Tuck all of it away in your memory. You never know when some currently considered 'ridiculous' information tidbit may receive future approval and become useful. Eventual validation of some theories such as a spherical Earth, originally declared ridiculous and impossible based on early observation, and now considered correct, has a rich scientific history. Earth really is NOT FLAT. Earth isn't a sphere, either. Recent Geophysical study says Earth is an Oblate Spheroid, 20 miles wider across the equator than Pole to Pole.

I do exploration for oil, gas, and minerals, and I am quite familiar with instances of the eventual usefulness of previously ""worthless"" information. That drab, rusty splotch of iron oxide on a rock might be a key factor in future development of an Ore Deposit Conceptual Model leading to new discoveries of gold. It happens.

Behavior requires Intent and Ability. Policy drives Intent. Does modern UFO behavior support evidence spanning millions of years in a pattern that might suggest Policy? Or, do recent data indicate only Randomness?

Many permutations to consider. Will individual observations ever coalesce into a Big Picture? Shift your imagination into high gear and turn it loose. Occam's Razor probably holds the answer. FOLLOW THE MONEY usually is a fruitful research method ONCE YOU HAVE DEFINED THE CURRENCY. The currency will NOT be modern dollars-and-cents money.

Look at the sky next time you go outside on a clear, very dark, Moonless night.

Some of the lights in the sky may not be stars.

Stay tuned.

I do not have proof because it happened so fast. The time of each sighting was less than five minutes. Each time I had an encounter something bad was happening to me. I was room 13 but I?m not making this up. The first time that I saw a ship was when I became homeless with my mother. It was around 1 AM and we were driving on the highway down a bridge into the downtown of Lincoln. My mother slowed down the car and she said ?look.? I looked where she was pointing and it was at the sky. I look up, and I see a big, circular shaped ship hovering over us. It was completely silent. There was lights all over it. The ring around the ship was moving but the ship was staying still. I couldn?t feel the presence and I didn?t notice them because it was already dark so there was no shadow resulting from the ship. My head was slouched down, which is why I didn?t notice the lights at first until my mother said look. My three other siblings were about five, seven and three. My mother stopped in the middle of the bridge, and we just stared. There were no cars. No one was out it was only us. It hovered over us for about two minutes. It seem to hover up straight instead of in a diagonal way like a plain one, and it disappeared in plain sight kind of like a fade. It felt as if they were following me and protecting me because my mother is a very bad person, and she did very bad things to me. Which is why the second part is important. 

One night my mother cut her wrist with a big kitchen knife infront of me to ?punish me? for existing. I was the same age 13 she invited friends over and she was partying with them and she had an abusive boyfriend. We originally moved to Lincoln to get away from him. She told him where we were and let him come. He beat her naked with a baby gate in front of me. It was the next day when he left and her friends were over she slit her wrist. She tried to make me responsible for taking care of my siblings.. So I ran away. This is when I saw my next sighting. I was in a bad part of Lincoln, and I was walking alone next to a bar that was down the street I was headed towards it. It was around 1 AM again. Nobody was out but me and the people at the bar. I was scared because I didn?t know where to go and I wasn?t from Lincoln. Suddenly I felt a sense of safety which is what made me look up. I don?t know why I chose up but that?s what since I got it when I looked up towards my apartment, because I was not far from it yet. I saw a group of triangle ships in a formation. They weren?t in an exact shape, but they were perfectly spaced out from each other in an abstract shape. They were just sitting there, hovering I was just staring at them. It happened faster than the first time, but it felt like they were telling me to go home Like they were protecting me I was never scared when I saw them ever not the first time or the second time I started walking back home instead of towards the bar area they all flew away in a kind of half circle motion, and vanished into thin air once again. Super fast this time, they were all black the ships before they flew away they had blinking white and red lights then there was nothing. I didn?t list this before in the options because you didn?t give very many to explain the situation. But I did have one more encounter before this. I want to make a note that this is not a joke. I want nothing from this. The only reason I am sharing is because I saw a news article that someone saw a alien in their backyard a couple days ago, and when you read some thing like that, it doesn?t seem like it would be real but I can?t help but question since I?ve had many encounters. 

This last encounter was when I was around eight. I saw one, an alien. I?m not joking with you once again, my mother, she starved us and locked us in a room. We had just moved to a new rental house in Omaha Nebraska. This was once again in a bad neighborhood. It was North Omaha, an area that most people don?t want to be in because people die. One night I went to ask my mother for food. She was up with her abusive boyfriend, watching a show the couch was faced towards the door there was a curtain over the door. So no one can look in the window. She was high and she was laughing at family guy with him. I didn?t say anything to her yet my room was around the corner and there was a wall blocking the view from the hallway and the living room. I was walking towards the living room and I had just reached the doorway, but I was hiding behind the wall, because I was scared to confront her, because when she was high, she was extra abusive and so was her boyfriend. So I was hiding behind the wall trying to see what she was doing before I asked for food. It was night time so she unlocked my door. When I was in the hall, I looked at the door because I saw something glowing. I saw an alien, it was green. It?s head was like an upside down triangle with a rounded edges. The eyes were black. I didn?t see the mouth right nose because it was peeking at me through the door window. I once again wasn?t scared, I was more baffled. I didn?t tell anyone and I walked away. Why? I feel like it was protecting me again. 

There?s some things people think they need to know the answer to. I?ve left this alone for so many years because I felt like they were doing something good for me. It was almost like they were redirecting my choices. I sometimes think, why me? I am a female. I am now 23. I was kind of also scared that if I told somebody something might happen to me. Almost like what they did for me shouldn?t be shared. But I?m just feeling curious.  I wonder if anyone else has experienced something like this and no I haven?t seen anything since. I do want to make a note of my life has completely changed, and my mother was hit by a car. She?s now disabled and mentally I?ll from the crash. I do want to make one more thing clear.  Her abusive boyfriend killed his child that was an infant, and he went to prison for it. He killed the child from an explosion making drugs. We had a restraining order against him at one point because he came at my sibling with a knife when he was on bath salts. I?m telling you whatever entity was on the ships and whatever was watching me was helping me.","Personal trainer & nutritionist",5,20,"unknown",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,"Unexplained","Possible",0,0,0,0,2013,2010,2,6,0,"Night","Midwest",1,0,0,0,0

I was blessed to witness UAPs on many different occasions right now I?m going to explain as best as I can, everything I?m saying is my truth and the only way you will believe me is if you see it to believe it yourself and then you will understand your own way and also understand what I meant as well, I was also blessed to have over 9 witnesses since 2011 till currently now in 2023 I been hunting them ever since watching the skies patiently loving the game of knowing that the altitude of outter space has more traffic than the cars on a highway, let?s begin my story the day was December 13 2011 and that year of you remember everybody was scared of the Mayan calendar prophecy approaching so that month had a weird 2k doomsday feeling but I was home enjoying fried chicken with my mom and my best friend so me and my friend decided it was time to smoke some weed now don?t judge me I been smoking weed all my life I know I was high but I was very aware and let me tell you I want to thank the marijuana for allowing me to see a UAP because that?s the only reason me and my friend went on the roof to smoke some weed to put all that fried chicken down that my mom had just cooked so we up there smoking and we never had a reason to look up but for some reason on that cold night we said to each other the stars look very bright tonight as soon as 12 pm hit we saw what we believed to be a shooting star so both of us go whoa that was so fast we barely look up at the skies so seeing that flash and stream left behind shocked us at first so that gain our attention even more to look up for longer without blinking and then less than 5 minutes another object streamed after what we thought was a shooting star now the second object was moving at the speed of light or a very tremendous speed to confuse us into thinking it was a shooting star but I was so scared it happened a second time that I almost ran back in my house but my friend said let?s stay on the roof and find out what is going on so it was cold I zipped my coat up rolled up some more weed and said let?s stay up here some longer, for the next hour we seen 20 UAP flying in the altitude of outter space you will never see a uap flying in our atmosphere where the planes and helicopters are you have to point your eyes directly straight above and you will notice the uap are in the altitude cruising past the stars the eclipse stars when the travel space but you can?t tell how far it is from the star but you know he?s really high up to give it that effect, so back to that first one hour me and my friend after what we thought was shooting stars we seen a Triangle Mothership and the Mothership was a Neon Light Blue color a light blue just like the spirit bomb from dragon ball Z that Goku uses in attacks it was the same color but the triangle mothership had hieroglyphic symbols on the bottom flat base so if it landed it would leave those crop symbols like they show on the farms but this mothership was super massive up close in earths atmosphere it would be bigger than the Independence Day movie mothership that will smith played in im telling you that mothership can engulf a country easily but even tho the mothership is traveling that fast the naked eye is able to capture what it looks like because something that if traveling the speed of light will be seen I think the smaller crafts will really just look like shooting stars but a huge mothership will be seen in a flash moment and the mothership streamed by and left a trail behind of gold dust maybe they use gold or some kind of similar gold material as engine fuel a lot of UAP don?t leave fuel trails behind except for motherships the smaller crafts usually leave heat waves behind them or streams like a comet but the motherships have some kind of engine that is using some kind of gold element and the gold trail slowly evaporated in outter space but it was a straight line like a jet trail and after the mother ship we seen a light blue orb that did a circle flight loop up and under to the moon but when it flew low on the circle loop it visually looked like it was in earths atmosphere for a moment back shot straight past to the moon and disappeared but the blue orb had same light blue color like the mothership and the blue orb look exactly like the spirit bomb from dragon ball Z but someone was controlling it from inside or from their planet cus of the circle flight loop it did , we also seen a startrek cruiser ship with wing panels on the side a long tic tac shaped shape with wings attached the the back end of ship not like how a plane has wings on the side the ship we seen the wings were on the back base of ship the lower bottom and more then 10 of these ships traveled thru the middle star of Orion?s Belt eclipsing the star as the following one another in flight it made me feel like they knew were they was all going together each ship difference in technology and design but flying at incredible speed one after another directly thru the middle star which made me believe the UAP use the stars as navigation and GPS to know which galaxy is up ahead, it was so many UAP the first night that I have to stop here on the first night because it was 20 sightings in one hour the first night so December 13 2011 made me a believer at looking up at the sky and something might pass by so now I had a trained eye that wanted more so me and my friend continued to look up next thing you know we realized we found a UAP that we can find every night we even call him the homie cus we can count on seeing him every night I showed him to all my family memebers and plenty friends and lovers got to witness with me on nights with no clouds so the homie ship one night my friend who I had the first encounter with we was looking up at the stars again now with more insight and belief we smoked our weed and out of no where we seen a star turn on or what we believed was a star that turned on from darkness to light shining next to regular star so we said here how did that star just turn on like that did we just witness the birth of a star lol so now that star that turned on had our full attention next thing you know the star started to move slowly we started to go bonkers as the star eclipsed another star next to it and then the star made his light go brighter and then he dimmed it off to where you can see his ship a small silver peanut shaped vessel he traveled a striaght path to where he disappeared into the horizon and in only less then ten minutes he leaped around to reappear to us again doing laps around earth so my friend said maybe it a satellite I said it won?t travel around earth that fast and camouflage as a star then as the star did a third lap it left at the speed of light letting us the technology was foreign and not a satellite from that night foward we see the homie every night he watches earth and goes back to his planet maybe for food and fuel but we are important to the homie ship because every other craft I witness is once in a lifetime maybe they from same planet maybe it?s different technologies from different planets but they know where we are and maybe we are not important from them to land here but we are in the middle of where they are going to so they pass by every night but the homie is a ship you will see all the time any other craft will be once in a lifetime but it?s so many different crafts and technology out there who really knows untill they land and confess , and I also witness a angel creature first I thought it was a bird at night then I realized it was a gigantic white bird flying in the altitude of outter psace eclipsing stars again but the white bird started to glow like Goku glows yellow super saiyan aura the bird had a yellow aura surrounding it letting me know it had energy it was massive and powerful and it can breathe in outter space and it flapped it?s wings to fly but each feather was so massive I don?t believe that creature is from a planet I want to believe the Bible talking about angels that?s what it reminded me of but to see it physically do that above my head and as it flew away I thought it was the sun traveling away in the night sky as he probably flew to another galaxy he did not circle earth but he flew directly over it going in a straight path , I want to end my report here it was nice discussing what I saw but you will only believe it untill you see it and I believe what I saw I?m happy to explain it as vivid as I can but I also want to help educate scientist and regular everyday working people to just look up at the sky you never know what you will find and not the atmosphere sky only look up at the higher space altitude thank you for your time if you know any scientists that want to watch the sky with me at my prized locations and high trained eye experience I will be very glad to show them what is really going on out here I am a black man from Haiti anything is possible if we are creation we are the proof that it exists elsewhere.

It was very bright, (much brighter than venus at its brightest), and looked like a pulsating orb of blue white light. When moving, it left a streak or a trail of light behind it.

It hovered beside a visible star in the sky that night and that is how it caught my attention. I only realised it was more than a star when it started to move.

Its movement was at first very slow and it did not pulsate at all in the beginning. It moved upwards and curved gracefully around its position in the night sky without deviating far from where i first saw it.

A few minutes passed and it just looked like a very bright object in the sky moving around up until it stopped near where i first spotted it, hovered without seemingly moving an inch, and then shot across the sky to the left on a very straight level, so fast that i almost lost sight of it. A trail was visible to the naked eye and this is when it started to pulsate in lumination and change its colour from white to whitey blue. A visible ring of light around the centre mass seemed discernable to my naked eye. It stopped seemingly immediately and just stayed there, before flying up at a fast but slower speed, gracefully arcing back to its starting position again where i first saw it.
This is when i pulled out my phone and started to record it. The video i have is recorded in uhd 60fps on my samsung galaxy s20 fe. The quality is good, but nowhere near as good as what i saw with my naked eye.

It all occured above a row of houses which almost and eventually did obscure my view of the object.

When recording, you can easily see the pulsating light and its ring if zoomed in, and the trail it leaves behind when it moved.
Unfortunately it did not move at such incredible blindingly fast speeds on the two minute video i captured. But it did fly at a what seemed to be a considerable speed to the left, arcing gracefully through a cloud before coming to an immediate stop, then rising slowly upwards and traversing back to roughly its ""starting"" position again (where i first saw it). Then it dips and glows very very brightly, before disappearing behind the row of terraced houses. This is where the video ends and i last see the object.

I did not hear any sound coming from the craft. I could not make out any tangible solid shape off of it. But i can without a shadow of a doubt put claim to it, that it was real, and something that i have never seen before.
I know what drones are like in the night sky with their downward lights on look like. I know how planes and satellites and the iss move through the night sky. Ive witnessed them all. This was something else entirely and i would love to be proven wrong because it has scared me a little bit. And i hate being wrong.
It displayed characteristics to things that i have only ever heared or seen about in other ufo sighting claims.

# i have two videos to share. Unfortunately the one that i mention in this description is 1.2gb in size due to its recording quality, and this site will not allow me to upload it. Fortunately i have uploaded it to youtube, but due to the swearing in it i removed the audio using youtube studio. I do have the raw original video with sound on my device if you want to offer me a different method of sharing it with you. The link it below. Set the video quality to high to see it properly.

The photos i upload are one of a map showing where i was stood (the bottom end of the yellow arrow), and the direction i was facing in.
The second image of street view show the same, but the arrow indicates the position that i first spotted the ufo in and ultimately the location it kept returning to (not precisely) and where it dipped behind the buildings and out of sight. Seen on my youtube video upload.

The second shorter video was recorded first as i was talking to a food delivery driver. In it i have taken a still of the object whilst zooming in on the recording video (post).","Dyson",2,1,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,"Unexplained","Possible",0,0,0,0,2023,2020,3,8,23,"Night",NA,1,0,0,1,0

July 3rd 2023 (full moon) While driving home with my kids I noticed the light shining way way brighter than any airplane or star. Airplanes flying past looked tiny in comparison. Fireball or ?light? was stationary not moving seemed low in sky and closer than any airplanes. Airplanes flew by ans if not there. Extremely bright seemingly burning fireball looked glorious in the sky. No noise. No movement. Went home to my rooftop patio where I often spend time - filmed again. I have seen this TWO other times, once in 2021 and again 2022 almost exactly the same but different dates, very slightly different locations and I?ve never seen this so close and so bright before - I watch this particular view at night regularly (almost every night) as I spend a lot of time on my patio. After 45 minutes to an hour light disappeared and did not return - I have not seen it since. I became really sick the next day symptoms of food poisoning. With other sightings I don?t recall if I had a physical reaction but I know that those sightings were also a one time thing. This is not the usual thing I see in the sky - I see airplanes from all angles constantly - this is not an airplane for certain. Or at least I?d be shocked to find out it was.
