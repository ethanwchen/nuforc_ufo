#### Notes on Higdon's Case:

- Aliens with antennas represent that of "My Favorite Martian" (1963).
- The word antenna was most densely used during the time of 1960-1990.
- The bluish alien color represents that of Andorian from Star Trek (1966).
- The idea of food pills was thought of as technologically advanced from Space Race sentiment.
