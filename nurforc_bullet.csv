saw something unusual Friday night (7/4) with my boys (7 and 6).  Didn't think much about it at the time.  It got us talking about shooting stars and stuff.  Heard it on the radio today (KMOX) and thought I would pass this along. I'll start by saying I am not a UFO fanatic, I don't believe in aliens or beings from other planets.  But I certainly saw something unusual the other night. It was between 9:15-9:45, we were waiting for fireworks (the show started at 9:45). My 6 year old noticed it first, and caught my attention. It was green, bullet shaped (like half a capsule.  A rounded edge, flat back.  No stream or tail). Streaked across the sky, and vanished about half way across.  It moved quite quickly, maybe I saw it for 2-3 seconds before it was gone. At first I thought it was some unusualy fireworks (but thinking it is very large).  Then it disappeared as a firework would, but with no explosion or fanfare.  Just gone. It was quite large, perhaps as large in sight as a full moon.

the UFO was witnessed by three other people and myself. We were standing in front of my friends place of employment when one of my friends looked up and said ""what the hell is that?"" The three of us looked up and saw what appeared to be an orange ball slowly moving across the sky. At this time, a customer came up and saw what we were looking at and said the same thing. ""what the hell is that."" My first impression was that it was a plane that caught on fire. But by observing it more. It appeared to be moving too slowly to be an airplane. Right about this time, we all observed what appeared to be projectiles coming out from underneath the ball traveling down toward the earth. The object then started to dim in brightness and get brighter again. It did this several times.

April 10 1998, ~5:30 am (EDT), crystal clear sky, pre-dawn light, only the brightest stars still visible. Cassiopea was still very clearly visible on a pre-dawn blue as it is a bright constellation. Between the North Star and constellation Cassiopea, 2 round objects of apparent size of about a penny at 20 feet 'faded-in' view as if coming from a higher altitude and coming down low enough not to be masked by the blue of the sky. The fade-in effect lasted about a second. It looked like something coming out af a fog. There seemed to be no self illumination. The color of the two UFOs could have been the reflection of the dawn Sun on a dull metallic surface. Hard to tell, apparent size was small. The color did not look even, sort of brighter in the center and brownish orange outside. Again this is more of an impression, as the size was too small for objective description of surface features. The formation appeared unmoving at first, one object was higher in altitude angle by about 2 moon diameters, azimuth North East, moved as a formation about 40 moon diameters east (towards the approaching rising Sun, which at that altitude was probably already up) and faded-out in exactly the same fashion they had come in, although they faded-out while moving rapidly east and were unmoving at fade-in. About 5-7 seconds. I am an experienced observer as an amateur astronomer for 30 years, a pilot for a few years in my teens and a general observer of nature. I don't have perfect vision anymore, I have a slight astigmatism and I was wearing my glasses. I used to be a software engineer (without a finished degree) and I now study Physics at the University of Montreal (back to school, got to get that degree). I am a skeptic. Still am, but I used to feel comfortable. My field now is astronomical optics, and I know what a sun-dog looks like, a comet, Venus, flocks of birds, nebulae, a meteorite, a galaxy, an aurora, a weather baloon, Jupiter, an airplane at high, low and medium altitude in foggy or clear conditions from up there looking down or from down here looking up. In winter and in summer. I've watched satellites go by hundreds of times, once even Soyouz in full sunlight, not penumbra as we are used to see orbiting satellites in, but if full sunlight; it glared many times brighter than Venus, quite a sight for all of 2 or 3 seconds. My point is that I am an observer, a good one, and a skeptic. This week is the beginning of spring and I saw flocks of Canada Geese, big birds, flying high enough for the birds to be the same size as the two UFO's of this report, and they flap, you see more flapping than bird actually, and even at that altitude you can hear them yak like a chikcken coop. The UFOs I saw this morning didn't yak or flap. This I am sure of: it was not two birds or weather ballons, planes or speeding bullets, helicopters, gyrocopters or Venuses. It was not any known human machine or animal. Which leaves unknown natural phenomena, ETs and SDI style research. ETs being the most unlikely of course. This is important: the movements suggested very low mass. An eerie 'easyness' about the movements which does not match the apparent size at all is what is most bizarre. Like inertia is for others. They seemed to go about the sky as droplets of water on a very hot surface. At least that's the best comparaison I can make. If anybody is interested I can make a small movie on the computer, but after the exams, in May.","Student",1,2,"formation",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1998,1990,2,4,5,"Morning",NA,0,1,0,0,0

On the above date and time, myself and 5 other deputys were working a drivers' license check at the main intersection of a small rural community in our county.I had just released a motorist to go on his way when I heard one of the deputys exclaim,""What the hell is that!"" I turned to face him and looked in the direction he was looking, which was to our northwest. It was not hard to see what he was looking at. I observed an object whose shape was hard to determine at first, as it appeared to be coming almost straight at us. I did easily notice the long trail of exhaust and flame that trailed the object. The object progressed rather slowly, about normal aircraft speed, from our northwest(right), to eventuaslly end up to our southeast(left). As the objectbecame closer and crossed our field of vision, a shape could be better made out. At first, a couple of us thought it might be an airliner that was on fire, but we could not make out any wings or tail structure. The glow from the trail of fire was illuminating the rear of the object somewhat. It should be noted that this sighting occured on a cloudless night with a 3/4 moon in the western sky, many stars visible, and a very clear view as we were far away from any city lights. When the object crossed between our position and the moon in the west, we could discern a cigar-like shape, reminiscent to me of a large missile(icbm type). The others present were in agreement as to the shape of the craft. At a point where the object was moving away to the southeast, but still mostly in front of us, we observed a very bright and instantaneous explosion near the ""nose"" of the object, immediately followed by approx. ten small objects which streaked toward the ground in a fan pattern, disapperaing in the proverbial""twinkling of an eye"". In fact, if we had blinked, I'm sure we would have missed them, they moved so fast. At that point, a couple of us were saying our prayers and waiting for the blinding flash and mushroom cloud. The closest thing I could think of to describe what I was seeing was an icbm that had just MIRV'ed. There was fortunately no explosion, much to our surprise and relief. We continued to watch the main object progress in controlled flight, to the southeast fo our position, until it finally became nothing but an orange circle of light, as if we were now looking straight at the rear end of the thing. We continued to watch the object until we could no longer see any sign of it. It flew out of our sight. It did not explode, blink out, disappear, or streak off at an unbelievable rate of speed. Once we rgained our composure, I radioed the sheriffs' office and asked the dispatcher to call the FAA Flight Control Center in McAlester. He asked me what was going on because he was already getting calls from citizens around the county who had also seen the object. He called the FAA and they had no report of any scheduled aircraft or any aircraft at all for our area. Within a few minutes, the dispatcher advised me he had received a teletype over the state law enforcement net of the report of an object that landed in a farmers field near Anadarko,Ok.(approx. 130 miles west of McAlester.), and that personnel from Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City were enroute to see what it was. That was the last we heard about this until the next day. I channel surfed the news all day long, checking for any mention of this incident, to no avail. Of the seven separate news stations we had available, not one mentioned anything until 1730 that evening when KOCO channel 5 in OKC made a statement that if you saw a bright light in the sky the night before and wondered what it was, you were not alone. They claimed officials at Tinker had no idea what it was either. At a second newscast on this same channel 30 minutes later, in fact, during the weather portion of the broadcast, the weatherman stated that officials at Tinker had determined that what we saw was a Russian ""booster rocket"" re-entering the earthe's atmosphere and burning up due to friction. Well, I'm no ""rocket scientist""(pun intended), but what I saw was on a perfectly level trajectory(horizontal) with no angle. There was definitely a large streak of flame behind the object, but it was emanating from the rear of the craft, not the nose as you would expect if the flame was caused by friction. The craft was not on fire, it was under propulsion. No other mention of this incident was ever heard by me. Those of us who saw it don't talk about it anymore. I still have video of the few seconds KOCO devoted to it though.","Emergnecy Management Director",6,1,"cigar",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1990,1990,4,12,2,"Night","South",0,1,0,1,0

The other just went out. We thought they were rocket boosters from the Cape, but there was no con or smoke trail.

We were part of a group of German Folkmusik enthusiasts, in a tour bus, from Stylus Transportation, traveling from the Riand Continental Hotel to the Disney's Wide World of Sports Field house, to see an Austrian music show called The Musikantenstadl. I am sure of the time because we were about five minutes from the event, and we exited the bus at the event at 18:50. I looked out the window of the bus and saw the 2 fairly bright white lights, that looked to be about 30 feet in diameter in the sky to the left of the bus. I told my wife to look, and she asked what are those lights. The other people sitting on the left side of the bus also saw them. I thought as did other people on the bus, that they were rocket boosters from Cape Canaveral, although I made the comment that these are the first rockets I ever saw that have no propellant or con trail. It looked exactly like looking directly into the tail end of a rocket booster. We didn't give it any more thought until we returned to Los Angeles and saw a news report of the event on the Monday evening news and found out that there were no missiles fired from the cape. We saw both objects for about 2 minutes. The seemed to be about 300 yards apart, and one was next to a cloud, the other in the open sky.The light away from the cloud just went out about 5 seconds before the other light moved behind the cloud and disappeared. There was very little lateral movement, if any, on either object.

I was setting up my telescope ( huge 12.5 Meade light bucket ) with 20 year old son-in-law.  Night was especially clear and we were using my wide angle lense for moon viewing.  While I was focused on moon, SIL said, ""Hey whats that!""  I turned, followed his pointing and coming overhead was a fast moving object.  It appeared slightly slower than a falling comet, but faster than any jet.  It was a single dot of white light that went in a straight line, but stopped, started and repeated this several times while I wheeled my telescope around to catch a glimps of it.  My SIL kept it in constant view by his naked eye and I aligned the Dobson mount and pointed the scope skyward at the object. It was nearly at the end of the horizon when I believe I caught a glimps of it.  It was only a fraction of a second, but I believe it was longer than it was wide and bright metalic.  No other detail could be determined.  While explaining this to a friend the next day I was advised he was 1 of 4 on patrol at apx 0400 hrs. in foothills about 90 miles away.  All 4 guardsmen observed 4 star-like objects flying high overhead until they shot away in different directions.  The were stunned.

Craft hoovered about ten feet over my head, backed off, lowered to eye level, then raised and hoovered over head again.

It was about 12:30am, Lake Secession, in Abbeville, SC.  This event occurred aprox. a quarter of a mile from a hydro-electric dam.  

I was alone when I noticed a whirring/whining dynamo type of sound outside.  I saw an amber colored flashing light reflecting on the trees outside.  When I walked out the door, overhead I saw a flying saucer (saucer/disc about 35 feet across and about 10 feet in height) hoovering above me no more than ten feet.  There were four sets of lights (each set had three rotating amber lights) which bathed the area in amber.  The outter skin of the ship was what appeared to be a silvery/shiney metalic color.  I recall being terrorfied beyond description to the point where I could not move.  (the house I was in was one of those lake houses that was on ""stilts"" where the outside deck was about 8 feet off the ground.  Also the lake house had twelve sides and would look circular from the air)  After hoovering overhead, the craft backed away some twenty (20) feet and lowered to where it would be almost eye level with me.  This craft was a saucer shape with a smaller dome on top.  The top dome had a round porthole (window) that was opaque/translucent and I could see that there was a white, low intensity light inside.  Due to the type of opaque/translucent characteristic of the porthole...I could not see if there was anything inside; however, I ""knew"" that something was in there and it was looking at me.  The craft then raised up, came forward directly over head and hoovered.  This event lasted approximately 5 minutes; although, there are gaps in my memory as to what exactly happened.  The craft then sped off effortlessly about 200 yards and hoovered momentarily over the Lake.  Then it sped off at a 45 degree angle towards the southwest at such a speed that I could not even begin to estimate, until it vanished from my sight into space.  That evening it was a crisp, winter night and the sky was clear giving me an excellent unobstructed view of the craft and the sky as it was departing. As far as my background.  At the time, I was 17.  I'm a white male.  I currently am college educated with a degree in General Business.  I am also a Vietnam Veteran and spent about 3 years on a US Naval Destroyer and have put in many hours as lookout while at sea.  I have been trained to spot and identify various types of aircraft and missiles.  This craft was not identifiable to any aircraft in existense in the United States or any other country's millitary or civilian air force. I've always had the feeling that there was something else that happened that night.  I have a gap in my memory as to all of the events that occurred that night.  I wish that there was someone that I could talk with about this.


((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT))

Change discription of noise....I need to make a change to my earlier report that I sent in.

I just entered a report last night....please change the sound that the UFO made.  I had originally typed in it made a Whirring/whining sound.  It was a whirring/whooshing noise. Also...several years later...I had bumped into a fried that I had known for a very long time and after years of not seeing him.  He asked me ""whatever happened with that UFO that you saw?""  I didn't recall telling him about that and asked him what he meant by that.  He told me that I had called him while the UFO was there...while it was over the house.  The reason that I said that I have gaps in my memory abouth this encounter was that I never recalled being on the phone with him and telling him about the UFO being there.  This more or less collaborates in a way, that this was happening.  Also....an addition to my background I have had many years experience as a radio announcer and radio news reporter.  At the time of this encounter...I had already had about 2 years experience in broadcast news gathering...so some of the details that I give are as specific as possible. I hope that you will make the changes in my original report that I sent in earlier.  Thank you.....again.

They were strangely foggy in appearance but moved independently.  No craft visible.

Returning home from work on March 7, 1998, I turned east on Bullard Parkway off 56th street in Temple Terrace, Florida.  My attention was drawn to two bright white lights aboput 30 degrees above the horizon and visible in my windshield.  They were strangely out of focus or hazy.  They moved independently from one another, i.e. they tilted.  Each was more or less formless, but also strangely each seemed to have a shaft of light pointing down as though each light was fastened to the bottom of an aircraft and pointed straight down.  But the shafts of light were not vertical cylindars, but truncated cones of white light.  Neither pointed down very far.  I estimated that they were less than one mile away and perhaps 2000 feet high, given their brightness.  I became concerned tgaht I would drive under them and lose sight of them, but it did not occur to me to stop off the highway and get out to look up. As I drew closer they were higher in my windshield, so I moved forward against the steering wheel to keep them in sight.  Before I reach my turn off the right hand light faded and disappeared, then the second light faded and disappeared.  They were rather peculiar, so I was at first reluctant to tell my wife, but I finally did before we went out for the evening.  I checked the sky as we left home about 7:30 but they were not to be seen.  I was relieved to see a haze in the sky then, as that would explain their foggy or out of focus appearance.  On the other hand the cloud layer was much to high to have had an effect.  I do not wish my name to be used!

As we were walking across the street, I saw almost directly over me, and flying over my house (about 10 ft above house), a line of crafts that were copper, and shaped like missiles.  They were going pretty slowly, and there were no windows or anything like that.  It made no noise. I had the distinct feeling that there was somebody(s) up there watching us--the street was full of children in costumes. I asked my mother what they were, and pointed to them, but she could not see anything.  I pointed again, and still she couldn't see anything, and we went in my house.

AT ABOUT 1400 HOURS, APPROXIMATELY ON THE DATE MENTIONED, TWO POLICE OFFICERS AND A CIVILIAN PILOT WERE IN A 182 CESSNA AIRCRAFT ABOUT 10 MILES SOUTH OF A MAJOR NORTHWEST AIRPORT, OPERATING IN THE ARSA UNDER APPROACH CONTROL. THE AIRCRAFT WAS IN A RACE TRACK HOLDING PATTERN ORIENTED NORTH AND SOUTH ABOUT ONE MILE BY TWO MILES, AT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FEET MSL OVER A FREEWAY. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR WITH BRIGHT OVERHEAD SUN, AND NO WIND, SMOKE IN THE AREA WAS RISING ALMOST VERTICALLY. VISIBILITY AND CIELING WERE UNLIMITED. THE TEMPERATURE WAS MILD TO WARM. OTHER AIRCRAFT WERE IN THE AREA BUT NONE WERE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. AS THE TWO PILOTS WERE INVOLVED WITH FLYING THE AIRCRAFT, THE OBSERVER IN THE BACK SEAT WAS SPOTTING VEHICLES ON THE GROUND PRACTICING TECHNIQUES TO ACQUIRE AND MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT WITH TARGETS ON THE GROUND. ON THE SOUTH BOUND LEG, ON THE EASTERN MOST TRACK, THE OBSERVER SAW A ROUND BALL LIKE OBJECT ABOUT TWO TO THREE FEET IN DIAMETER WITH A SEAMLESS, MIRROR LIKE SURFACE TUCKED INTO THE FOUR O'CLOCK POSITION, RELATIVE TO , AND KEEPING PACE WITH, THE AIRCRAFT, ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET OUT AND ABOUT THREE TO FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW. THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION, AND NO LIGHT SOURCES. THE ONLY REASON IT WAS VISIBLE WAS THE CONTRAST OF THE SHINY OBJECT TO THE DARK GROUND. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN TO FOLLOW THE AIRCRAFT THROUGH A NINETY DEGREE TURN TO THE WEST, THEN A NINETY DEGREE TURN TO THE NORTH. IT CONTINUED IN IT'S RELATIVE POSITION, FLYING FORMATION WITH THE AIRCRAFT, ON AROUND TO THE SOUTHBOUND LEG. THIS PERIOD OF OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY THE OBSERVER ALONE WHO DID NOT NOTIFY THE PILOTS, NOT WANTING TO BE RIDICULED. TOWARDS THE END OF THE SOUTHBOUND LEG THE RIGHT SEAT PILOT OBSERVED THE OBJECT IDEPENDENTLY AND WITHOUT BEING ADVISED BY THE OBSERVER. UPON BEING ASKED THE OBSERVER THEN ADVISED THAT HE TOO SAW THE OBJECT. THE LEFT SEAT PILOT COULD NOT SEE THE OBJECT AS IT WAS TUCKED IN TOO CLOSE TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. AS THE SCHEDULED TURN TO THE WEST WAS MADE THE LEFT SEAT PILOT MADE AN UNUSUALLY STEEP BANK AND IT WAS AT THAT TIME HE TOO SAW THE OBJECT. THE OBSERVER ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE OBJECT WAS A MYLAR TYPE SILVER BALLON. IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS A VIRTUALLY WINDLESS DAY AND FURTHER THAT THE INDICATED AIRSPEED WAS ABOUT 75 KNOTS AND THE OBJECT WAS MAINTAINING IT'S POSITION AND TURNING WITH THE AIRCRAFT. APPROACH CONTROL WAS QUIRIED AS TO THE PRESENCE OF ANY POSSIBLE RADAR CONTACTS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. THE REPLY WAS NEGATIVE. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO DIRECT QUESTION AS TO WHAT WAS BEING OBSERVED THE CONTROLLER ASKED THE APROXIMATE RANGE FROM OUR AIRCRAFT TO THE CONTACT AND WAS ADVISED WITHIN ONE QUARTER MILE. THERE WAS A STANDY ORDER THEN AN ADVISORY THAT THERE WERE NO CONTACTS IN THE AREA, AND THEN , ""DID WE WISH TO MAKE A REPORT"". THE LEFT SEAT PILOT DID NOT THINK ANYONE WOULD BELIEVE THE INCIDENT, AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE WORTH THE TROUBLE. THE RIGHT SEAT PILOT WAS A LOW TIME PILOT AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE SANCTIONS AGAINST HIS LICENSE TO FLY. THE OBSERVER WENT ALONG WITH BOTH PILOTS WHO DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO REPORT. THE OBSERVATION CONTINUED AND AN INQUIRY WAS MADE TO THE GROUND UNITS BY THE OBSERVER IF THEY COULD SEE ANYTHING IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE REPLY WAS NEGATIVE, AND WHEN ASKED BY GROUND UNITS IF WE WERE WATCHING A UFO THE REPLY WAS, ""AS A MATTER OF FACT YES WE ARE"". THERE WAS NO CONFIRMATION FROM THE GROUND. THEN AS THE AIRCRAFT TURNED ONTO THE NORTHBOUND LEG THE OBJECT SUDDENLY, AND VERY SMOOTHLY ACCELERATED OUT IN FRONT OF THE AIRCAFT AT ABOUT THE SAME ALTITUDE. IT COVERED THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWO MILES IN ABOUT TWO TO THREE SECONDS ACCELERATING FROM ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE KNOTS. THE OBJECT THE EXECUTED A NINETY DEGREE RIGHT TURN TO THE EAST, AFTER A RADICAL DECELERATION AS THE TURN WAS MADE. THIS MANEUVER CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED AS THE OBJECT DISPLAYING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A 50 CAL. TRACER ROUND FIRED FROM THE AIRCRAFT. AS THE TURN TO THE EAST WAS COMPLETED THERE WAS AGAIN A DISPLAY OF ACCELERATION THAT WAS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE. AGAIN THE ANALOGY OF A 50 CAL. TRACER ROUND IS CONSISTANT WITH THE FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT. THE ACCELERATION, A BALLISTIC CURVE, AND THE SPEED WERE ALL ABOUT WHAT ONE COULD EXPECT WHEN OBSERVING A PROJECTILE BEING FIRED FROM THAT TYPE OF WEAPON. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN TO ENTER THE TREES ON THE NORTHWEST SHOULDER OF A MOUNTAIN TO THE EAST, APPEARING TO HAVE CRASHED. THAT OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY ONE OF THE PILOTS. THE OBSERVER WAS INSTRUCTED TO FIX THE EXACT LOCATION OF POSSIBLE IMPACT WHILE THE PILOTS FLEW A NORTH, NORTHWESTERLY COURSE FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE PATTERN INTENDING TO OVERFLY AND POSITIVELY FIX THE LOCATION FOR GROUND INVESTIGATION. AS THE AIRCRAFT APPROACHED TO WITHIN ABOUT A MILE TO A MILE AND HALF OF THE POSSIBLE POINT OF IMPACT, THE OBJECT FLEW UPWARDS OUT OF THE TREES AT ABOUT A TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY DEGREE ANGLE TO AN APPROXIMATE ALTITUDE OF FIVE THOUSAND MSL. THE ACCELLERATION AGAIN WAS EXTREMELY FAST AND SMOOTH, BUT AS THE OBJECT LEVELED OUT ON A SOUTHERLY COURSE IT, AS RAPIDLY, DECELERATED TO A MORE LIESURELY PACE, ABOUT ONE OR TWO HUNDRED KNOTS. THE OBJECT CONTINUED ON THIS COURSE FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE WHEN IT EXECUTED A LEFT TURN, ABOUT FORTY FIVR DEGREES TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST AND ACCELERATED AWAY AT AN ASTONISHING RATE DISSAPPEARING FROM SIGHT IN A VERY SHORT TIME. A SIMILAR OBJECT WAS SEEN AT A LATER TIME IN AN AREA TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE ORIGINAL INCIDENT DISPLAYING SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS ALTITUDE, SPEED, AND LAST KNOW DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THIS INFORMATION CAME ABOUT AS A TELEVISION SHOW OF VIDEO RECORDED SIGHTINGS WAS ON. THE WIFE POINTED OUT ONE OF THE OBJECTS, A SILVER BALL, AND MENTIONED HER OBSERVATIONS. SHE WAS UNAWARE OF THE SIMILARITIES OF THE TWO INCIDENTS AT THE TIME OF THE CONVERSATION. THE PILOT OF THE PLANE IS AN EXPIERIENCED HIGH TIME CIVILIAN PILOT. THE COPILOT IS A LOW TIME LICENSED PILOT AND IS A POLICE OFFICER WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS EXPIERIENCE.

Large number of police saw 3 objects within an hour of our sighting but on the other side of mountain that they disappeared over.  Interceptor aircraft attempted to engage.  See below.

Sometime around this time,  (1966-1969)...It may very well have been Labor Day Weekend in Sep 1967, I was camping near Crestone, Colorado with several cousins.  It is 40 miles north of Alamosa.  

We had just watched the sunset and could just see the other side of the valley to the west.  We all saw the same thing.  I saw it first.  It looked like a very large meteor was about to hit the other side of the valley.  

I got everyone's attention as the object got closer.  It was a ball of fire coming down from space.  At around 30,000 feet, it split into three balls of fire.  At that point our mutual reaction was that it was a mirved missile hitting the western range of mountains surrounding the valley.  

We started to take cover behind a very large boulder when the three objects made a 90 degree turn and came across the valley straight at us.  Our thoughts later were that they were intelligent and had detected us watching and decided to buzz us.  

They took approximately 5 seconds to cross the 40 mile wide valley flying perfectly horizontal and in a 3 abreast formation with one slightly ahead of the one on either side.  

We were at about 9000 feet on the side of the 14,000 foot Crestone Mountain range.  The three objects were trailing several thousand feet of sparks (?) and looked like they would pass just overhead and hit the mountains behind us.  

We rushed to the other side of the boulder and took cover, but the three objects disappeared over the mountains peaks to the east.   We stood around in silence for a few moments and then started asking each other what we saw.  

We were all recent college graduates.  I  was leaving for Air Force Officer's Training School on the 13th of September and then going to Pilot school, so it very well could have been September 1967 right before I left. 

We decided that it could not have been UFO's or anything in the Human inventory, but we still were thinking (hoping) meteors.  We had all expected a huge impact explosion and minor earthquakes when they surely hit on the other side of the mountain range, but felt and saw nothing.  The three objects had made a roaring noise that had drowned out attempts to yell at each other until the silence after the passage. 

The next day we went down to the Crestone trading post to buy a newspaper, but there was nothing in the paper.  We telephoned the Alamosa Sheriff's office and asked about large meteor impacts or UFO reports...nothing.  

The next morning, we bought another paper and discovered that less than an hour after our sighting the Colorado Prison on the east side of the Crestone Mountains had seen three lights hovering around the prison.  The Colorado Highway Patrol and local police had chased the lights around for over two hours while the off duty guards were recalled to duty in case of a helicopter prison break.  Nearly 300 police saw the lights that night.  

Finally, the Colorado Highway Patrol called Petersen AFB to check for radar images and the base reported positively and at the request of the Colorado Highway Patrol launched two F106 intercepters.  The Air Force thought they were police helicopters patroling around the prison or looking for escapees and didn't know the lights were being chased by the police for two hours.  

The pilots had the images on radar shortly after takeoff and were closing fast.  The lead pilot asked for permission to fire weapons and while waiting, the radar images and the 3 lights went straight up accelerating far faster than an air to air missile could have flown.  

The weapons release was never given to the pilots who had attempted to follow them until their F106's could climb no higher and the objects went out of sight straight up into space.  

We all purchased copies of the newspaper to keep forever, but none of us have ever been able to find those newspapers or any other record of the incident.  One of these days after I retire and have lots of time, I would like to find the old newspaper files. 

None of us have ever taken drugs or had enough alcohol to impact our judgement even though we are all over 50 now.  In fact one of the cousins does not even drink coffee because it is a stimulant.  

If you have any records of the incident I would gladly pay for copies.  It would be nice to have the hard copy documentation for my own satisfaction.  

I'm sure my cousins that were there would also like to have copies of their own.  

I have a security clearance and still work for the US Air Force, one of the cousins is now a lawyer, and the other is an emergency inhalation therapist and ex-Green Beret.  

This should be well documented because of the number of people that saw the lights near the prison and the newspaper article.((Number deleted))

5 points of light observed approximately 20 degrees of arc in the northern skies. 

I had just stepped out of my truck after arriving in Bend at my girlfriend's parent's house and the brightness of these lights caught my eye because I hadn't recalled ever seeing a constellation in that area of the sky before. There had been snow showers in the vicinity and the skys were in a broken condition with cirrus clouds also in the vicinity. 

Objects were first observed almost stationary. Then, after a few seconds, I noticed they started moving in a straight line towards an approximate 330deg direction.  The speed they were traveling was about twice as fast as a satellite would be observed moving but much slower than a meteor entering the atmosphere. 

All objects remained equi-distant from one another, approximately 1 finger-width between each. They were all white in appearance, the same as the surrounding stars. No sound, fire trail, strobe lights, running lights, flaring, or fragmentation was observed.  

The front 3 objects were as bright as the surrounding stars. The 4th object in line was a little brighter, and the 5th object was approximately the same brilliance as Jupiter. 

I had time to call my girlfriend over to my side of the truck to also observe this event. We watched the few remaining seconds as they seemed to fade out of sight at approximately 40deg of arc due possibly to the high cloud obscuration.

She also has never seen anything like this before. (I might add that she says she 'doesn't' belive in flying saucers). 

I reported this event to the Pine Mountain Observatory message center outside of Bend at approximately 19:15 11/6/98. They called me back saturday, 11/7/98 and took the information. At that time there had been no other reports of the sighting in any other part of the state or area.

I was a radar operator at an early warning radar sight. At about 2200hrs we painted a target about 200 miles west, in Soviet territory. It was moving eastward at a high rate...about 10,000kts. We had no height finding radar, so could only guess at the altitude. We thought it was a missile. In accordance with SOP for picking up unidentified targets, we turned on the scope camera. As the target continued eastbound we lost radar contact, but the next site, at Cape Romanzoff picked it up. We were later told that the target was carried continuously until it was east of Iceland, and that the total time was about twenty minutes.","Airline pilot",10,1,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1957,1950,4,10,22,"Night","West",0,1,0,0,0

When the contrail hit 90 degrees, it vanished indicating that any object (unseen) might have entered or exited friction points.

At the same time the contrail was being observed, a Boeing 747 was in a landing patern bound for Los Angeles Airport.  This aircraft was flying at a ruduced speed at about 12,000 feet along the same direction nearly crossing the path of the higher contrail.  The object creating the contrail was clearly moving at four to five times the speed as the 747 from our vantage point.

I am a college student majoring in computer science here in the Northern California Bay Area. At 6:27 this evening, as I sat studying in my room, I glanced out my window and noticed an unusually bright light moving rapidly across the sky, heading north west. Thinking it might be something unusual, such as a satellite, meteor, or maybe the space shuttle, I went outside for a better look. I followed it closely as it moved the night sky. It made no sound, had no flashing running lights of any sort, and appeared to be at a very high altitude. I was about to go in, thinking it was probably a satellite, when it began to fire what I can only describe as missiles or rockets! I could not believe my eyes! This thing let loose seven bright projectiles which traveled away from it and down, leaving a bright tracer. There was a pause between each one. Certain it was not a meteor breaking up, I phoned the coast guard, local air traffic control tower, and the local paper, but no one else had reported a similar sighting.  I have never seen anything like this before, and would like to know if anyone else on the West coast witnessed this.

They were in a ununiformed formation, & all had massive comet-like tails.

On 12/16/98 2 friends and I were fishing on Long Key, Florida.  We were fishing from a bayside dock, and at approx. 11:30pm we witnessed a phenomenal event.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw the sky light up, when I turned my head I thought I was seeing things.  I immediately got my friends attention and we all stared in amazement.  There seemed to be approx. 12 objects moving from the southwest (Keywest area) towards the northeast.  Each one of the objects had a comet-like trail behind them, this trail made them all seem to blend together into one bright blob.  They were in a disorganized formation and they moved at a constant and straight forward path.  They looked to be a yellowish-white coloration similar to that of a bright star.  They took up a very large portion of the sky.  We watched them for approx. 30 seconds.  We first saw them half-way through the sky and watched them fade out over the horizon.  Each of the objects appeared to be round or comet like in shape.  From our vantage point they seemed to be much larger than stars, planes or even the Hailey's Comet. Considering that only a few hours earlier we started bombing Irag, our first thought was that it was a large group of missiles.  They moved much slower than a shooting star or meteor, however, they moved faster than a typical airplane or helicopter.  After witnessing the event the three of us starting driving home.  We saw a car stopped on the side of the road about a 1/4 of a mile from where we witnessed the event.  We stopped to ask if they needed help.  They said that they were fine, and asked us if we had seen the lights in the sky.  We were thrilled that someone else had seen the lights.  As we were talking about the lights, their road-side assistance pulled up.  The driver of the road-side assistance was estatic, he too saw the lights.  The driver told us he watched the lights for over a minute (from one side of the sky to the other).  As we were driving home we wondered how many others had seen this event tonight.","Fishing Guide",3,12,"fireball",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1998,1990,4,12,23,"Night","South",0,1,0,0,0

This object was a bright green light that was travelling at an unearthly speed. Unfortunately, I was driving and it only caught my attention just before it went out of sight. It was heading downward, right to left at a 45 degree angle. The only characteristics that were different from a falling star were the color (bright green) and the time of day (sun up).

I was taking a lunchtime walk around an industrial area in Poway, CA on 02/23/96. At approximately 12:40 pm, I was heading in a NNW direction on Stowe Road, 1/4 mile north of Scripps-Poway Pkwy.  I looked up into the sky and noticed a white point of light about 60 degrees above the northern horizon.  It was slowly moving toward the south.  The weather conditions at the time were as follows:  mostly clear skies, scattered cirrus clouds, temperature about 65 degrees, winds from the SSW (both at the surface and aloft), with wind speed about 10 mph at ground level.  By 12:43 pm, the object became stationary at a position about 70 degrees above the northern horizon.  It appeared to hover in that position until 12:45 pm, when another similar object ""blinked on"" just to the east of the first object.  At that moment, both objects began to move fairly slowly towards the west, with the first object pulling slightly away from the second.  Both objects appeared to pass under the cirrus clouds in the area.  At 12:49 pm, the first object changed direction towards the SW.  The second object continued to move toward the west.  The distance between the two objects continued to increase to the point where I could no longer keep both of them in a single field of view.  At 12:51 pm, the first object was approximately 50 degrees above the western horizon when it suddenly streaked across the sky from west to east and disappeared over the eastern horizon.  The elapsed time of this high-speed exit from the area was 10-12 seconds.  I immediately looked back to where the other object had been, but it was gone.  I did not see it leave. I have made the following conservative altitude and velocity estimates: 1.  Scattered cirrus clouds at approximately 25000 feet 2.  Both objects were below the cirrus clouds. 3.  Distance travelled by first object during high-speed exit from the area assuming altitude of 15000 feet = 25-75 miles 4.  Estimated velocity of first object during high-speed exit = 6000-18000 mph It is clear to me that these objects were not conventional airplanes, balloons, meteors, stars, etc.  They moved against the wind, hovered and displayed high-speed characteristics beyond anything that I've ever seen or heard.  At no time did I hear any sound from either of the objects.  There was no sonic boom during the high-speed maneuver.  Both objects appeared as white points of light with no other details observed.  They were both clearly under intelligent control.  The sighting took place in an area where there were frequent flybys of Navy F-14 and F-18 fighters returning to Miramar from training exercises over the Pacific.  However, no military or civilian aircraft were seen in the immediate area over the entire duration of the sighting. I believe my estimates of altitude and velocity are conservative, my gut feeling is that these objects may have been at an altitude closer to 25000 feet and the velocity during the high-speed maneuver may have been more like 20000-25000 mph.

T","I observed a bright light in the distance that seemed to be making some very strange/irregular/quick movements across the night sky.  The object kept getting closer as it was heading our direction.  We pulled over off an exit ramp and observed the triangular shaped object silently hovering overhead.

One night, years ago, sometime between 1967/68, while driving home from a movie with my younger brother and my best friend (actually, my friend was driving, I was the front sea passenger), I observed a bright light in the distance making some very impressive, yet highly unorthodox, movements across the distant sky.  As we continued to observe and we realized we were approaching the object and that it was heading our way too.  The strange motion behavior I'm referring too, is it would appear to quickly race across the sky, come to a virtual standstill, then quickly dash across the sky in another completely different direction, where it would once again appear to just halt in the sky.  It was a single bright light and did not have any flashing lights (typical of conventional aircraft).  This observational phase went on for a few minutes.  Eventually, we realized it was getting real close as we pulled off the highway exit ramp and pulled over.  We were in an old ragtop VW so we didn't even have to get out of the car to witness what we then saw.  Much to our astonishment, virtually hovering right over our head @ approximately 500-1,000 feet was a single, black, triangle shaped object.  It had lights on each of its three tips, but none of them blinked, and they were all white/yellow in color.  Needless to say, we were all blown away.  We had never seen or heard of anything like what we were now observing.  As we watched, the object literally just floated silently overhead in a very small circle course, right overhead.  I remember verbally describing it in detail to my friend, so we could both validate we were observing, as frankly, it was very difficult to believe, event though we were all seeing ith with our own eyes.  It was black, and totally silent.  It would just slowly hover overhead or just come to a complete standstill.  Becasue it was a clear night and the visibility was good, we could clearly see that it did not have wings and it certainly was no helicopter or any other conventional aircraft.  It w! as simply a black triangle with no markings or flashing lights of any kind.  It was completely silent in the quiet night sky; no prop sounds; no jet sounds.  After watching it for a few minutes, it quit circling overhead and started to fly away slowly.  Then, as quickly as you could blink your eye, it suddenly just shot off into the night sky faster than a bullet, without so much as emitting a single sound.  It was truly an astonishing event to observe.  We were all excited and drove home where we told our story to my disbeleining mom and dad.  I actully called the local police dept. and Miami International airport to tell them what we saw and ask them if they had seen the object or traced it on radar.  Both indicated that they didn't have a clue about what I described. None-the-less, my friend, my brother, and I all knew what we saw, and it was very real, and it wasn't anything that we knew existed in conventional aircraft.  Over the years, I learned to just remain silent on the subject, as the usual response was one of disbelief.  Frankly, that didn't bother me too much, because had I not seen what I saw with my own eyes, I too would've had a very hard time believing it.  Then, I saw a special on TV recently (where I got your webpage info) and was totally blown away to discover that other people had also seen triangular UFOs!  Prior to that, I thought all UFOs were circular or cigar shaped, as that's mostly what was represented in the various UFO books that I had stumbled on over the years.  However, I must confess, that I have always been an airplane bluff and have kept pretty current over the years, so I was totally blown away when I first saw our F-117 Stealth plane.  It made me wonder, ""where did the air force come up with that idea/design?""  Also, I have since actually seen the F-117 and though my memory has definitely faded some over the years, I'd guess that the physical size of the triangle we saw, was about the size of an F-117.

At Riley Cove on the western shore of Saratoga Lake I saw a silent craft hovering over Saratoga Lake.It was emitting a steady, brilliant, warm light, far brighter than an airplane or helicopter.I'd say its altitude was less than 200 feet, and it was about half a mile out over the lake, definitely close enough to hear an aircraft engine, but the craft was completely silent. I stopped my car and started my videocamera,and filmed it hovering there. I zoomed in as tight as I could, then panned back, and as after I did, I saw a black streak shoot up out of the lake, there was just enough twilight left to see it against the sky. It shot up like a bullet. It happened in an instant, but I remember thinking that someone must be shooting something at this craft. But as it reached the altitude of the first craft it began to light up, and suddenly it was a second brilliantly lit craft hovering in the sky, about one hundred yards to the right of the first craft and a little bit higher. I was really shocked, it happened so quickly, I've never seen anything move like that, in less than one second it went from the water to hovering in a fixed position in the sky. I kept the camera fixed on the two craft as I undid my seatbelt and got out of the car,and they hovered there for several more minutes. Then the first craft seemed to change, it turned into what appeared to be a flat triangle, which began to pulse and fly slowly past the second object, then slowly looped back around again, remaining nearby the second craft. Conventional airplanes began approaching the second craft, also flying closeby to it.                                       The second craft (the one that shot up into the sky) remained hovering for several more minutes, at times motionless, then drifting slowly slowly one way, then heading back in the other direction towards the southern end of the lake. It started to move more quickly,heading across my field of visio! n so I was seeing the side of the craft. If it were an airplane or helicopter I'd have seen the tail lights, strobing lights, or individual lights, but this craft remained a single, large, solid warm light. The southern end of Saratoga Lake is ringed by a heavily wooded hillside, and the craft was travelling just at the hill's treeline in a bobbing up-and-down sort of motion, dipping below the treeline, then floating back up from behind the hill's dark pine trees, eventually going down like a setting sun behind the trees.       I do have this incident on videotape.","Artist, UFO investigator",1,2,"changing",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1998,1990,4,12,17,"Afternoon","Northeast",0,1,0,0,0

One night in early July we were watching some aircraft along the airway (providence to NY which runs northeast to southwest, slightly south of us)with all their lights on and strobes flashing.  We both noticed a light of normal brightness and size east of us (somewhere over Rhode Island)traveling across this path to the southeast.  This white light didn't have any nav or strobe lights around it.  It was traveling horizontally just above the horizon to our right and away from us in a slight climb when it became very bright for a couple of seconds and disappeared.  It was traveling about the same speed as the other aircraft 250mph+/- and way too slow to be a shooting star.  Definitely not fireworks either.  I know aircraft and this was not conventional behavior.  The brightness was like that of a typical white taillight and then a landing light being turned on and pointed exactly at you - very bright.  I'm sure that is not what it was - no aircraft could turn around that fast point at us and still travel along its path backwards.  And when I say it disappeared, I mean nothing left of it.  Also, no sound.  We could hear the other aircraft that night.","designer",0,1,"light",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1999,1990,3,7,22,"Night","Northeast",0,1,0,0,0

This sighting was in the summer 1970 or 71, I was only a teen at the time and didn't take notes of the event.I was in the back seat and due to the hot weather I had been holding my head partially out of the window to cool down, as we approached a stop sign my eye's caught the glimmer of something directly in front of us in the sky, I focused my attention more at this and was assuming it was a box kite, but I realized quickly is wasnt swaying in the wind nor had string or tail attached, I then assumed rather oddly that it was a water tower and looked for girders or beams holding this thing up in the air, then I suddenly realized what I was seeing and imediatly brought this to the attention of my cousin in the front seat,We both watched this thing for about 30 to 45 seconds. The object was shiney on the upper section and rather darker on the under side due to being shaded from the sun, however arrayed around both upper and lower sections were dark panels, those panels on the shaded underside were more pronouced then those on the more shiney upper section. The object never moved during this whole duration then suddenly shot in a northerly direction with a speed that was astonishing... being stunned at this tremendous acceleration I yelled at my cousin "" ..did you see that !!...""  he said yes it disappeared,I said "" no it didnt it shot to the north like a bullet "" this object never made a sound, and no shock wave was heard. My cousin wore glasses and I don't know if contributed to his failure to not see the sudden acceleration of this object .......in later years when I began to look into this phenomena I looked over this area on maps and noted there was a Naval Air Station very near the area of this sighting. I have refrained from reporting this sighting due in part to the unfortunate witnessing of other objects dureing other times in my life, realizing that the chance of seeing one ufo is remote, but to have other sightings years apart is even more remote, how ever I will submite these other reports also so that perhaps others whom might have witnessed the same object during those time frames might have some comfort knowing they were not alone, and I would gladly take a polygraph in all reports that I have submited.......","printer",2,1,"disk",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1970,1970,2,6,15,"Afternoon","West",0,1,0,0,0

Incorporate by reference the Summary Description above The streak had a duration of 1-2 seconds, and occurred in the sky far distant from Redondo Beach. It was the track and intensity of the streak that gave me the impression of an incoming ballistic missile. I actually looked for a place to take cover should there be an explosion.  However, to my relief, there was no follow-up sound or explosion.  Shortly thereafter I arrived home to tune-in to the start of the Art Bell show. Mr Davenport was being interviewed about strange lights over Las Vegas within the ""last hour"" or less.  I'd say that my sighting was approximately coincident with the time frame expressed by Mr. Davenport in his report. The time coincidence motivated my original e-mail report. I have checked my maps while writing this report.  Las Vegas appears north east, and Phoenix slightly south of east of Redondo Beach.

I have a BSEE and 3 graduate degrees in Engineering, including an MS in Aeronautics & Astronautics.

((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM SAME WITNESS))

Message--

I looked at the picture of Dec 19.  The white trailing streak rang a bell.

I filed a report of an evening event (6/9/99  21:58 from Redondo Beach Cal.) seen from Redondo Beach on my way home to listen to the Art Bell show.  It so happened that you were being interviewed about the same time about strange lights over Las Vegas.  I went back to again read my report on 
www.ufocenter.com and it describes ""An intensely white-phosporous colored streak heading down vertically from the overhead sky..""  The event appeared SE from my observation point while Las Vegas is generally NE.  Thus the streak did not show vertical where the reported event occurred. OK. 

First, for what it is worth, that white streak trailing that white ball in subject Dec. 19 photo reminds me of what I saw and reported upon that evening.  It might be that what I saw was thicker and traveling vertically.  However, the white trail is of Dec. 19 is what I meant by an ""intensely white-phosphorus colored streak"" seen against a background of a dark.  

Secondly, another point now captures my detection. I consider it of second order but worthy of consideration.  In the Dec. 19 photo, the white streak and ball is approaching a ""target"" horizontally after a vertical decline.  In other words it does not descend vertically into its apparent target-the 
volcano. But this too is consistent with the observation and proximate time report out of Las Vegas. I saw the vertical streak SE from Redondo Beach while the action you were reporting upon was over Las Vegas which is NE from Redondo Beach (see my account in the report of 6/9).  So to me this suggests that vertical streak sightings and somewhat distant horizontally observed arial phenomena may still be causally connected. 

One other unrelated point.  In the past from time to time observers in your reports on the air refer to flying objects as being ""motionless"". Remember now, that an earth bound observer ""observes"" from a rotating reference frame (the earth).  So if an object is witnessed as being motionless, it is to say 
that v=dR/dt = 0 relative to an observer on a rotating reference frame.  It is also to say, that the object has the same motion as the earth-bound observer, which is probably not zero in an absolute sense.

Moving directly ahead of the storm front and below the clouds was an object that I could not identify.  At first, I thought it was some type of missile.  It didn't have any wings.

I was outside looking for something in the sky when this thing streaked across 3/4 of the sky.  It started like a sharp pencle lead drawing a line across the sky, and the streak became a little widerer as it crossed the sky.  The streak was a dull orange in color, and there was no flash of light like a meteor would produce.  It traveled from a south by south-east toward the north by north-west in two seconds.  It seemed to disappear into the north sky, but a few seconds later I realized the tail was the only thing that disappeared.  The object had come to a complete stop, and the object was dropping toward me position.  It dropped until it was four time size of Mars, or about the size of a 22-cal bullet.  It looked like a distant white star when it stopped in the sky, but it looked like a bright white-orange ball when it stopped dropping toward my direction. It was about 1/2 mile north of my position, and its elevation was at about 10,000 ft. when it slowly (400 or 500 mph) moved due west of my position. My view was obscured by some trees, and I lost site of the object.  I moved to a different location, but the object was out of my view.  The object made no sound, nor did I see another tail or exhaust. The whole thing lasted a very short time, but the westerly movement was the most time consuming.

I was 20' from craft, the engines started up with an intense wind coming from craft--about 100 MPH wind.  Pinned me against my pickup truck, as it shot straight up faster than a rifle bullt and disapeared!

My wife and I built an underground house, sucluded in a wooded area. A pond laid right beside it. One night as we arrived home around midnight, I was crossing the pond levee(which was my driveway) Immediatley the pond and hillsides were light up like the middle of the afternoon.  Then I stopped the truck and got out looked above the pond about 10' and witnessed a 12' circular light on the bottom of some sort of craft.  There was no noise heard, I then yelled at them to come on down and they'd be safe. The craft stayed until my pregnant wife with my young son ran for the house. When my wife disapeared around the house, the crafts engine started and almost blew me down.  The wind was at least 100 MPH. It shot straight up until it was out of sight, faster than a rifle bullet! I believe that the craft seemed to be taking up water into it. Shortly after this incident my infant daughter was born and developed an virus that needed medical attention, and the doctor ask my wife if she had been to South America.  Because there was no cases of that type of illness in the U.S. We believe the craft may of had something to do with this illness.  The next day from viewing the craft there was a 12'  diameter circle mashed into the weeds where it must of landed. That was my first and last sighting, it has changed my way of thinking forever. It was definetly something from another planet, with way more technology then we have today.","self employed contracter",2,1,"disk",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1980,1980,1,3,0,"Night","Midwest",0,1,0,0,0

Date correction of original sighting report (1968 not 1969) of  UFO  over Otis AFB;  F-4s chased off UFO.

The incident posted on 9/12/99, regarding the 7/4/1969 sighting over Otis AFB was accurate, except the correct year was 1968.  

I was with the 552nd Air Police Squadron and on the evening of 7/4/1968, I was guarding the Falmouth Gate-one of the three perimeter gates.  That evening was uneventful until ~2100 hours.I received an urgent phone call from my Sergeant, who ordered me to close the Falmouth Gate, adding that we had been placed on Full Base Alert! 

After approximately 1 hour, he called back to say that the Alert was over and to re-opened the Gate.  Later,the SGT came out and informed me that there had been an actual UFO hovering over our underground missile site; that our F-4 jets had scrambled and were on an intercept course. The intruder then initiated a 360`maneuver, accelerated at an unimaginable speed and was gone.

I am a twenty one year old college student with no criminal record or history of mental illness.  My other witness is 22 and does not believe in UFO's.  On thursday sept. 2, my friend and I were really bored.  We decided to take a ride in the country and cruise down the roads we hunt and fish on.  We left Galva and drove down The Lafayette Blacktop.  We crossed the road by the cemetrary there and continued on.  About a mile down the road that completely stopped our conversation.  WE saw an orange light rise from a cornfield about 20 yards away from us.  I stopped my truck and we both were watching it.  It was a real clear night.  The light appeared to rotate on some unseen object, and another one appeared in it's spot.  That onr rotated also and a third appeared.  We sat and watched.  I told my friend I think it was a UFO.  He doesn't beleve in them and didn't know what to think.  I was scared.  I wanted to turn around asnd go back to town.  He said that we should keep watching so we did.  The orange lights were nothing like I have ever seen before.  It kind of looked like a lava the way it glowed.  That is the only way I can explain the color. As we were watching, the object disappeared.  WE decided to drive along after that.  About one minute later it appeared agin and was moving south at a very slow speed.  We gave chase to it and followed down towards Walnut creek.  We saw it hovering above another corn field. We stopped my truck and rolled the windows down to sewe if We could hear it.  There was no noise except for the regular coutry noises you hear.  Anyway, the thing stared moving and disappearing and reappearing.  We chased it from Walnut Creek to Hook & Bullet, Out by Williamsfield all the way back over to Oak Run.  It was like it was playing Cat and Mouse with us.  We lost the object when we got to Oak Run.  We decided to stop at the main beach and talk about what we saw. Then over the lake, the object started coming towards us at a very high rate of speed.  it stopped across the lake from us and hovered. We jumped in the truck and chased to the outskirts of Victoria where it just vanished and we didn't see it aagain.  It was around 11 PM so we went back to Galva.  I was very scared that night and so was my friend.  We only told  a couple of people that we are close friends with because we didn't want people to think we were crazy. Myself and some other friends have witnessed evets like this many times since then.  I would be happy to talk to them over the phone or through another report.","Student(Hamilton Technical Institute)",2,1,"changing",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1999,1990,3,9,20,"Evening","Midwest",0,1,0,0,0

We agreed that it looked much like a shooting star.

Wednesday, September 1, 1999 at approximately 9:30 p.m., my husband and I were traveling eastbound on hwy. 37 in Marin County, Ca.  The location was approximately 1.5 miles from the Black Point/Atherton exit.  We saw in the sky directly above our car what looked like three long, thick, fingers of light traveling at a very slow speed, they looked very much like super high beam headlights shining through a thick fog, (there was no fog that night).  We continued to watch this light show while we looked for a place to pull over on the highway.  As the lights crossed directly over hwy. 37, we saw what looked like a small missile, or shooting star, shot off the side into an easternly direction.  The lights looked as if they had come from a north/west direction, and they were crossing over hwy. 37 in a south/east direction.  At the time of observation, my mouth filled with the taste of having bit down on aluminum foil on a tooth filling.  I had the sensation of metal emitting from an upper back crown in my mouth.  This taste stayed with me for approx. 10 minutes after the viewing.  The next morning I woke up with the insides of my lips feeling sunburned. When we arrived home (which is 1 mile north off of hwy. 37) our 12 year old daughter told us that she had been sound asleep and was woken by the popping sounds of the vertebra in her neck, her mouth was filled with a ""bad taste, like a burning taste"".  At this point she looked up through her bed side window and saw bars of bright light going over our house.  She remembers that her bed side clock read 9:30.  The three of us felt exhausted the next day.  We all sensed that what we saw was some kind of pre-empt of something much larger to come.  When my husband and I pulled off the freeway to view the lights more clearly, they continued to move slowly for a few seconds, and then completely disappeared, one second they were there in front of us, the next, they were gone.  We sat there for several minutes in a very stunned mode. I am a 43 yr. old mother of two small daughters, aged 12 and 8.  I am currently working on a project in conjunction with the Institute of Noetic Sciences, called the Future Generations Initiative.  This Initiative is working toward bringing together like minded efforts that are working to raise the consciousness of our youth so that they may be more prepared to face the challenges that we leave them.  I am working closely with the Institute, as well as with members of the State of the World Forum.

At 22:29, I went out onto the back porch of my apartment which borders a heavily forrested area and stretched, looking up towards the Northwestern sky.  I was looking between two very tall cedar trees at the stars when I observed a glowing, greenish object moving steadily from approximately the Southeastern horizon to the Northwestern horizon.  I may very well have my directions a bit off center but I immediately thought that it was not a comet or meteorite because it was moving perfectly horizontally and not in a downward manner like an object entering the atmosphere.  It was definately not a private or commercial jet landing at Paine field and the object did not appear to be a missile because at an arms length of distance between thumb and forefinger, it measured at about8-10 millimeters in circumference.  I couldn't tell you how fast it was moving but it would be similar to watching a vehicle at maybe 20-25 miles an hour pass by you.  It was completely silent and a discernable glowing, greenish tail followed it.  I then went inside looking for the hotline number but couldn't find it so I decided to wait until I came to work tonight.  Then, at approximately 22:33 on the same night, I heard the most awful noise RESONATE from the forrested area behind our building.  It sounded like a cross between a coyote and a cow.  I'm not trying to speculate at any animal mutilations, but I began to freak out at that moment and brought my cats inside.  These howl-like noises continued for about six minutes at an interval of about a sound every thirty seconds, becoming more frequent towards the end.  Nothing else happened after that and the two incidents may or may not be related but on a side note, I work on the waterfront in downtown Seattle and have observed some interesting things floating about in the sky.  I listen to Art Bell on occasions when I can and I know that there are numerous sightings these days, so I hope this is useful information to you. Also, I just remembered that I noted that there were NO jets coming into or out of Paine Field for about three hours after this incident on the 14th.  The air was totally silent which was very unusual.","contract private security officer/ student",1,1,"circle",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1999,1990,3,9,22,"Night","West",0,1,0,0,0

Observation: My friend and I were on our way to his daughter's house in Euless Tx on the evening of Friday September 24, 1999. At around 20:30 hrs we were travelling west bound on Highway 183 and had just taken the exit to highway 10 when I noticed what I thought was a police helicopter hovering several miles away. The light pattern consisted of two soft crisp white lights (no glare, like white globes.)equally spaced in a horizontal plane centered on a triangular formation of three synchronized, pulsing (not flashing), red lights. there was a dark green patch in a whispy V just above the red lights. On initial observation the outside white lights were spaced as far apart as my pinky finger held up at arms length. We were startled when the object quickly came strait toward our position as we approache the first stop light after the bridge.  Duration of the transition was less than two seconds and the object stopped several hundred meters away approximately 100 meters AGL at our 1 o'clock position. Accelleration and decelleration appeared to be instantanious.  At this point the white lights were spaced as far apart as all four of my fingers held together at arms length. The object held its position for approximately twenty seconds then slowly moved less than half of its lenth to the left. As the traffic signal changed and we started forward. It was then that the object sped off in the same direction that it had come from becoming apulsing point of red light in the distance.  We lost sight of the object behind the local terrain.  At no point during this observation did the relative position of the lights change (ie rotate, tilt, lose relative spacing etc...). Total duration of the observation was approximately one minute. Two outbound civillian airliners were observedat a higher altitude during the progression of the observation.

The object was almost invisible, but seemed to be reflecting ambient light either from ground lights or from the eclipsed moon, as the color was almost that of the eclipsed moon.

At about 10:22 CST, my brother-in-law and I were outside in his backyard. We had been observing the lunar eclipse through his telescope, but having become bored with that, we turned the scope on M42 in the constellation of Orion. I had already located M42, my brother-in-law was in the process of changing the lens to a higher power while I was observing the constellation and waiting. I noticed movement above me. Looking directly overhead, I saw what I first took to be an atmospheric disturbance, like a vortex of air. The night was exceedingly clear and full of stars, without much ambient ground light, and there was no wind. However, the leading edge (as this was the direction it was moving) of the object or vortex was faintly illuminated by a light of nearly the same color as the eclipsed moon (reddish-brown). It was almost invisible, and for a moment, I doubted what I saw, thinking perhaps it was a floater in my eye. I asked my brother-in-law to look, and he immediately spotted the object and exclaimed ""what is that?"" The object, as I said, was an arc shape, about 90 degrees of a full circle, with a relative size of a baseball held at arm's length. Within the arc, there was no apparent blocking of the starfield, such as there would have been had the object been spherical or disk-shaped and reflecting light on its leading edge or underside. It moved very quickly from overhead to between Sirius and the constellation of Orion, toward the southern horizon, when it seemed to pass beyond our range of vision. There was no sound, and no wind. I would guess that it was visible no more than six seconds. In addition, the arc shape did not remain constant, as it would if it were the leading edge or underside of a spherical or disk-shaped object. It seemed to flow, not-unlike the way a line of geese or ducks flow and waver as they fly. My brother-in-law, who has better eyesight than I do, even said that he thought it was numerous objects flying in an arc-shaped formation, but that they flowed and shifted, not unlik! e geese. However, I have considerable experience 'in the wild' and have seen flights of migratory birds both during the day and at night. First of all, to have formed this impression of an arc, there would have to have been numerous birds flying at a great height, much to high to have been seen from the ground at night. If the same formation had been seen during the day, and if they were ducks or geese, then they would have had to have been moving at super-sonic speed. To move across the sky in that amount of time, the birds would have had to have been much closer to the ground, in which case they would have been easily discernable as being birds of some sort, and at that height, given the size of the arc, could not have been more than five or six birds, in which case they could hardly have been mistaken for an arc shape. Also, they made no sound, whereas ducks and geese will honk and quack as they fly, and even when not, you can hear their wings - but there was no sound. Instead, my best description of the object is of a non-solid sherical object, clear, with light either reflecting along its forward edge or underside. As to size and speed, I can only hazard a guess or impression, as there was nothing to judge by; it could have been very large and high and moving very fast, or small and low and moving slowly. But my impression was that of an object about the size of a house, flying at two-to-four thousand feet, at about the speed of a cruise missile.","self-employed resaler and freelance writer",2,1,"other",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2000,2000,1,1,22,"Night","South",0,1,0,0,0

In the fall of 1957, shortly before the Sputnik satellite went up, I was in front of our house in St. Paul when I heard the roar of F-89s. The F-89 was an all-weather, 2-seater, twin engine fighter interceptor based at the main airport. With its very loud J-35 jet engines, they never or rarely ever flew at low altitudes over the metro area. It wasn't unusual to hear them take off, but it sounded as if the noise was lasting longer than usual. It was about 7:00pm, and already dark (before the Daylight Savings Time era). (I couldn't positively identify the planes, but there was nothing else located there which made that much noise. The military areas of the airport also hosted F-80s, T-33s, C-47s, C-119s, Navy Phantoms, P2V Neptune sub hunters, helicopters, and miscellaneous others - none of which made such a horrendous racket. Commercial jets were not yet using the MSP airport except for 1 French twin engine jet which came and went, one day, as part of a sales mission.) After a while, I looked up and saw a row of red-hot exhaust pipes (or exhaust) and navigation lights all westbound, coming from the east at perhaps 5,000 feet. It looked like a string of firey brands. They were making one heck of a racket, and I took them for the F-89's. Then I noticed a bright light in the sky - brighter than Venus in the western sky, except this light was in the wrong place to be Venus: it was south-southwest from me at an angle of almost 45 degrees, and hanging nearly over the airport. At first I thought it must be some kind of expensive, well-done prank. Then I thought it might be a helicopter with intensely bright lights. Finally, I noticed that the planes appeared to be headed straight for the object. The object remained in place as if it had all day to make up its mind if it were going to move or not. Finally, it DID begin to move - slowly at first - towards the southwest. The jets adjusted course to the southwest. Then the object picked up more and more speed, and finally turned off its brilliant white light, and sped away. It was still barely visible for a few moments after it switched off its light, and had a dull, glowing orange appearance, and had some small white lights around the main body. The jets followed in that direction, and eventually disappeared. All the noise finally stopped. I ran into the house and checked all the TV channels expecting to see a report on the object chased by the F-89's, but there were no reports. Nothing. Just your typical Ozzie and Harriet, Gunsmoke, etc. Then I finally sat down to read the evening paper. On the front page was a small article which said: ""Mystery Object Sighted Over RAF Base. A mystery object was sighted today over one of Britain's RAF bases, but when pursued, it doused its light and sped away."" I cut out the article and posted it on the bulletin board in our high school science class, explaining that I might have seen the same object.","Retired.

It was during late 1965 and I was home sick from school when I just happened to look out of the front door window when I noticed what looked like a metallic sphere reflecting in bright sun.  I remember how clear and blue the sky was and noticed this little ball about the size of the point of a Bic Pen slowly drifting westard.  I thought it must be a weather balloon because I could still see that it was rounded.  Of course I didn't think much of it until it suddenly stopped and simply hung in midair for a little too long. I thought that that was very odd - especially when it began to jiggle and ping-pong up and down and side to side with such speed, grace and agility that nothing earth-made could compare.  It then quickly dropped downward while increasing in size to about a pencil's eraser, still reflecting the sun and began jiggling and ping ponging some more.  It then drifted slowly eastward and rose and dropped again where it jiggled some more until it hung in midair again.  Then it finally shot eastward from a dead stop across the horizon and out of sight like a bullet. I all, I'd say this took about two minutes.  This sighting was reported to local police and reported in the local paper.  About 18 months ago is when the Richmond Times Dispatch recreated the sighting and called it ""The Great Central Virginia Sighting"" and noted that more than 25,000+ reports of this are on file from the Cental Virginia area.

NTSB Identification: NYC97SA193. The docket is stored in the (offline) NTSB Imaging System. Scheduled 14 CFR 129 operation of SWISSAIR TRANSPORT CO. LTD (D.B.A. SWISSAIR) Incident occurred AUG-09-97 at NEW YORK, NY Aircraft: Boeing 747-300, registration: HBIGF Injuries: 3 Uninjured. On August 9, 1997, about 1707 eastern daylight time, the flight crew of a Boeing 747-300, Swiss registration HB-IGF, and operated by Swissair as flight 127, reported an unusual sighting while in cruise flight at 23,000 feet (FL230) over New York, New York. The airplane was not damaged, and there were no injuries to the occupants. Flight 127 which had departed from Philadelphia International Airport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was conducted under 14 CFR Part 129, and was operated in visual meteorological conditions on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. Flight 127 was en-route to Boston, Massachusetts when the sighting was made. According to a report from a Safety Board Air Traffic Control investigator: ""Swiss Air 127 was in contact with the Danbury Sector of the Boston ARTCC at Flight Level 230. Voice communications with Swiss Air 127 were of a routine nature until 2107 UTC, when the flight transmitted, '...sir, I don't know what it was, but it just over flew like a couple of hundred feet above us. I don't know if it was a rocket or whatever, but incredibly fast, opposite direction.' The controller asked, 'In the opposite direction?' Swiss Air 127 replied, 'yes sir, and the time was 2107, it was too fast to be an airplane.' The controller then asked another flight, Eastern 986 if they saw anything like a missile in the area, 'perhaps off your right.' They replied that they would take a good look, but 'didn't think that if it's going that fast they probably won't get a chance. They had just seen Swiss Air go by a little bit ago.' "" ""Swiss Air 127 then reported that they had no warning, & that the object was going way too fast. The controller then asked how far above Swiss Air 127 it was. Swiss Air 127 replied, 'it was right over us, right above, opposite direction, and, and I don't know, 2,3,4 hundred feet above. All that I can tell , 127, is that the three of us saw a light object, it was white, and very fast.' "" ""The flight was then cleared direct to Providence, and told to reduce speed to 300 knots before contacting the next sector."" Interviews were conducted with the captain and first officer on August 10, 1997. The flight engineer had not observed the object and was not interviewed. The captain reported: The flight was abeam of John F. Kennedy Airport, Jamaica, New York, at 2106, and proceeding direct to RAALF intersection when the event occurred. The captain was making a public address to the passengers in the cabin when he looked ahead and saw a white object. He saw it for less than a second, and the only movement he could discern was opposite his flight track. He did not observe any wings, and was not sure it was an aircraft. He thought it was cylindrical in shape. He had never been so close to other traffic before. He was not certain whether it was stationary or was moving opposite of the flight. It passed over the cockpit, slightly right of centerline. If it had been any lower, it would have hit the aircraft. As the object passed by, there was no noise, no wake turbulence, and no disruption or anomalies with any of the flight or engine instruments. At the time of the event, the airplane was flying on a heading of 060 degrees, at 340 KIAS, at FL230. It was clear with cumulus nimbus clouds to the west. The sun was behind them. There was no TCAS warning. In addition, there was no exhaust or smoke, no fire, and he could not accurately discern its size. The captain reported his total time as 15,000 + flight hours. He had never seen a missile in flight. The first officer reported: The flight was cruising at FL230. The captain was making a PA to the cabin. The first officer was putting on his headset, and bent over to adjust the volume. As he looked up he saw the object. It passed overhead very quickly. It was close enough that he ducked his head because he thought it would hit them He said it was white and had a round shape. There was no smoke or fire visible from the object. He thought it passed about 100 to 200 feet above the airplane and between the right side of the fuselage and the number 3 engine. There was no drift, and it appeared to be flying exactly opposite of the aircraft. No actual movement was discerned, and no markings were visible. The object appeared to be the size of a thumbnail held at an arms length. The engine indications were steady, and the visibility was unlimited. The sun was behind the airplane. The first officer reported that he had previously encountered a weather balloon over Italy, and the object did not look like the balloon. The first officer reported his total time as 7,500 hours, all civil. He has seen missile shoots from the ground. A check with a Safety Board meteorologist revealed the following: WEATHER BALLOONS * Weather balloons are launched twice a day. * The normal times are 1100 UTC, and 2300 UTC. plus or minus 15 minutes. * The time to reach 23,000 feet is normally about 25 to 28 minutes. Sounding balloons are light tan or brownish in color. * PIBAL (used for wind observations) and Ceiling Balloons are black and red in color. * The closest launch point to the JFK was Upton, New York, about 43 NM east of JFK on a bearing of 085 magnetic. A check of winds aloft data from Upton, New York, revealed the following: Date Time Altitude Velocity Direction Temperature 9 Aug 12Z 500 MB 35 kts 350 degrees -14 C 10 Aug 12Z 500 MB 15 kts 360 degrees -12 C 9 Aug 00Z 400 MB 20 kts 330 degrees -22 C 10 Aug 00Z 400 MB 20 kts 330 degrees -22 C Radar data was supplied by the Boston Air Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), in the NTAP format. The data contained both secondary targets (beacon), and primary targets (non-beacon). The data was plotted and Swissiar Flight 127 was identified. There was no evidence of an opposite direction target, either beacon or non-beacon.

When I was about four years old I saw something which left a real impact on me.  I have never been able to completely discount this event as explained.  I was playing with a freind in his backyard and looked up - due west and at about 2oclock or 45 degrees - and saw what looked like a cylinder, or as I thought at the time, a missile or a plane with no wings.  Moving left to right, it crossed my field of view in less than ten and perhpaps about five seconds. I must have recently seen something about missiles because I remember thinking that's what I was seeing...but also that it seemed very strange none-the-less.  It seemed at first to be as high as a commercial airliner, but then it appeared to be much smaller and lower that a jet would fly.  It was silver and without any other appreciable detail that I can recall.  My clearest memory of the event would put the objects length at about 30 feet and with a diameter of about 7 feet...less than 25% of its length.  It's distance would then be about two or three city blocks.  I sometimes thought about this as a child.  When I was old enough to realize that missiles do not normally fly over peoples houses, I eventually assumed that I had seen a plane banking so that his wings were parallel to my line of sight.  But upon further reflection, I also remembered being quite sure that the object was a simple cylinder having no vertical structures.  I never even made the connection to cigar shaped UFOs until recently...it had just never clicked for some reason.  What strikes me now is the lasting impact that the event had on me.  I don't mean anything mystical here, simply that even at the age of four I seemed quite sure that this thing was very strange.  It was one of those rare events which imprinted clearly as one of my earliest sustained memories in life - like the first time I saw Santa Clause or when I got my first tricycle.  It is this conviction in memory which motivated me to report this story.","Systems integrator / physicists",1,1,"cylinder",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1965,1960,2,6,13,"Afternoon","West",0,1,0,0,0

This was a big, white sphere with a black spot on one side rotating counterclockwise. It looked like a spinning eyeball tumbling through the sky faster than any airplane I've ever seen. It also ""fuzzed"" in and out of focus while we watched it, ranging in clarity from hard/shiny like a silver christmas ornament to soft/fuzzy like a white cotton ball. It was also impossible to guess how big this thing was or how far away. A Sunday afternoon when the freeways were full of people going home after a day out at the malls or wherever. We were heading east from downtown and were just going over that big spaghetti bowl where the I-10 jacks into that freeway headed towards the Army base, starting to go north along the east side of the mountain. I thought at first it was one of those plastic grocery bags being whipped along in a real high thermal, thinking it was going real fast for that. Then I saw it was big, shiny, solid, tumbling, real high, supersonic speed. Wait: small, fuzzy, soft, close. Hold on, it keeps changing! What the hell is that thing? Like a big, crazy, weird, spinning eyeball. It's really moving on, too. I hope it's one of ours. It's almost out of town, it's gone. Take me to the crazy house cause I'm hallucinating. It either popped like a balloon or got shot out of here like a rock in a slingshot. Maybe straight up or at a slant up and north over White Sands, hundred-thousand mile-an-hour. Somebody tell me what the hell that was! I still wouldn't believe to this day I had really seen something like that except that there were four other people in the car who saw it, and doubtless thousands of others in the thousands of other cars on the road with us. Also, the Nasa T-38's at El Paso International Airport, the ones that escort the shuttle in on its piggyback ride when it lands in California, they were circling around the airport like a bunch of buzzards because what they had gone up to chase was long gone. To top it all off, the driver of the car was a retired Army lifer with all kinds of spooky top-secret clearances for his job he had for years on White Sands Missile Range. We'd just finished a 3-week running debate about UFO's a couple days before this. He described his job, his clearances, and how he'd seen everything there was to see ""out there. And there ain't no such a thing as no little green men!"" He had me convinced for the first time in my life, and kind of depressed at the idea that maybe we really are alone in the universe. I'm glad it only lasted three or four days. He was asking me over and over ""What is that?What is that?"" When it was gone, I had to rib him: ""You tell me, Mr.Top-Secret Man. It was something, you wouldn't ask what it was if you hadn't seen it, an Object! You gotta admit it was Flying awful god**** fast. And until you tell me what it was, (cause you know about everything and I'll take your expert word on it), it was Unidentified! A UFO.""  I think he's still mad at me for that, and still won't admit it was a UFO. But I saw the damn thing, Nasa saw it, everybody on the freeway saw it, and probably everybody in Juarez, too. They can't go on saying millions of us are just crazy or stupid forever. So I'm sticking to my guns, and I'm never gonna shut up about it, and I'll never stop trying to find out what it was. It changed the way I understand reality forever. I don't know about the UFO's other people have seen, I only know ""mine"". Just give me ""mine"" and I'll be happy and go away quiet, dammit.

We were laying there talking when I first noticed a light VERY high in the sky.  It was coming from the west and didn't blink or change colors.  It was white and moving fast across the sky.  I know how to spot a satalite and this wasn't a satalite.  I pointed it out to my roomate and we both were watching it.  Then we noticed anouther craft flying behind it.  We both had been in the US Army and we could tell it was a jet.  You could just barely make out the wing's light's on the second craft.  After the first one went over we never heard a sound of the engine.  At first we thought it was due to the hight it was flying.  But after the one we knew was a jet got passed us we heard the second craft's engines.  The plane had already gotten almost out of sight when we finally heard it so it had to be going suppersonic!  But it never got close to the the first object.  The jet was definately giving chase to the object they were on the exact same flight path.  After both craft were out of sight we sat there and talked about what we had just seen.  Neither of us could hardly believe it.  A few minutes later we saw coming from the north a repeat of the first account!  But after the second ""object"" got passed us we noticed a second jet coming from the south on an intercept course for the second object.  The object blew right past the plane from the sout and the jet performed a high speed turn.  Neither jet ever got close to it. The first jet that waas chasing the the second object was also heard after it passed over us.  The second chase jet from the south never flew over our position so was never heard.  All three craft continued south until out of site. While I was in the Army I personally got to view many aircraft on the ground, taking off, and in the air at night.  The two objects were nothing I had ever sean before.  I was a Combat Medic and went all over the world.  My roomate was a Missile Specialist and also had seen many aircraft and had traveled greatly during his military career.  The only thing either of us could come up with was that the two objects were UFOs (I don't mean that they were Alien nature, just that they hadn't been Identified) and that a total of 3 jets had given chase.  Also that atleast two of the jets  were traveling at supersonic speeds and never got close to the objects. Object description --  The two objects were extreamly high and just looked like a white light. They never changed shape or color and never changed course.

It was 1978, (Jan 25th-Feb 5th 1978)two weeks before the big Blizzard.  The place was Warwick, Rhode Island, the Buttonwoods/Appanoag Section.  It was sometime late at night or early morning.  My parents were sleeping. I went to the bedroom window.  I observed round (like a ball) light, slowly decending to the ground.  The distance I'd guess was about a city block away.  Since I was a child, I said to myself, ""Oh a plane light fell off"". I had not heard of UFO's, etc. The next day I went to my babysitter's house.  I told he about the ""red plane light"" in a nonchalantly way.  It was not a big deal to me.  The babysitter's husband, worked at TF Green airport in Warwick about a mile away.  When I recall his uniform it had decoration like an Airforce uniform.  I guess he might have been in the service somehow.  The babysitter told her Husband what I saw. The Husband came home and I overheard him telling his wife there was a lot of phone calls about the red light and that no airplanes lost lights.  He proceeded to question me about it.  I simply told him that I saw an airplane light fall. He made a phone call and then returned to work. As an adult now, I realize that an airplane light, if it fell off a plane, would not still be lighted up red.  I researched old newspapers for any mention of this incident.

this report is being submitted in response to the ufo sighting reported here for ely, minnesota, on 6/8/00, in the boundary waters canoe area. i also saw a similar ufo back in june of 1984. the location . i was on a canoe trip and it was about 7:00pm. i had just finished cleaning up after dinner and was getting ready to do some evening fishing from the shoreline. i had just reached the shore when i noticed a blue-ish object descending at about a 45deg angle from about a mile away. the speed was similar to a formula one racing car at speed (200+ mph) and the altitude when i first noticed it was maybe 1 mile. (i used to sky-dive, road-race cars and motorcycles, and pilot airplanes, so i am a good judge of speed and distance.) the object passed in front of me (over the lake) at a distance of maybe 100 yards and an altitude of maybe 200 feet. it wa slowing continually during the descent. there was no sound. when it was at its closest, i could see through the glow and the object was shaped similarly to a diamond in a woman's engagement ring. (round when viewed from the top; near flat on top and expanding to a wider profile then tapering to a point in the side view) the color was varied from the blue of a royal crown cola can through to the color emitted by a blacklight. it disappeared behind the treeline maybe 100 yards down the shoreline. i stood there stunned for a couple of minutes and was getting ready to walk down the shoreline to see if i could see anything more when i noticed the movement of something coming through the woods. all i will say here about what happened over the next hour is that i communicated through telepathy (i didn't initiate the conversation and just had to think what i wanted to say.) with a blond-nordic. i did not go to the craft and didn't not see it except when it passed in front of me while descending and when it left. (it ascended in reverse of the way it descended.) there was no ""physical examination"". i wa sober and was not tired. i am not subject to hallucinations. i have a measured i.q. that qualified me for membership in ""intertel"". when i was in the military (1968-1971), i was a sergeant and worked as a fire distribution systems crewchief in aadcp's for nike-hercules missile defense syetems and had several ufo sightings on our radar systems both in the united states and korea. these were also seen by the members of my crews. my father and i also saw a cigar-shaped ufo over kansas in the summer of 1964 as we were flying one of the family planes from our home in iowa to the family ranch in oklahoma. my father also had a sighting in 1962 when he was driving from iowa to the family cabin in minnesota. he told me that he spotted something that landed in a field next to the road he was on. he said it was about 1/4 mile away from his car to the spot where it touched down. my father had a pilot's license from 1955 to when he passed away in 1973. he also built his own airplanes and was a groundcrew crewchief in the army air corps in morocco during the war.

I realize that you prefer to post verifiable events, and I won't mind a bit if you don't post this in your database. But the report of the dream from that fellow in Seattle 03/15/01 made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. When I was a child growing up in Trail, BC, I used to have the same recurring dream as that described by your Seattle correspondent. As I got older, the dream would recur less often. Oddly, I had the dream again, after an interval of many years, only a few months ago. In my dream, the early morning clear daytime sky is filled with these objects flying over at relatively low altitude, leaving trails that are not contrails, as I stand in our backyard watching (we lived at this location in Trail from the time I was about two years old, 1958, to 1964). Some of the objects are dark green, but many are shining, golden coloured. I don't recall seeing markings on the objects, however. I don't remember when these dreams started, but I do recall that at first I had them almost every night, sometimes more than once in a night (I usually woke up immediately after the dream, and the recollection of the dream is vivid in my mind for days afterward), then less frequently. By the time I started university in 1974, I was having them once or twice a month. By the 1980s, I seldom had the dream. As I got older, I attributed the dream to a child's interpretation of events related to the Cuban missile crisis, although I don't recall if they started at the time of this event or not. I never thought that anyone else would dream of exactly these same objects. I don't really expect (or want) to see this in the database, but I wonder if the person who contacted you from Seattle might want to know that others have had the same dream, from the perspective of where they were living.

The size was massive and as the lights spun around, they emitted a white flame with orange red smoke.  Some cars on the freeway pulled over but I was too mesmerized and stunned. They were slow moving and were visable for at least 3 minutes.  After they had passed, I drove through a magenta fog for approximately 1 mile.

At 9:09 p.m. PDT May 6, 2001 during late twilight, I was standing on the roof of my apartment building concentrating on an area of the sky just south of the constellation Leo awaiting the appearance of a satellite (Cosmos 1943 Rocket, U.S. Spacecom number 19120), which was scheduled to (and did) appear in this area at 9:11 p.m. (Observation of low Earth orbit satellites is an occasional pasttime of mine; I use a satellite tracking program to predict visible satellite passes.) About 5-degrees south of the star Regulus (or at about 207-degrees true, 55-degrees elevation), my attention was diverted by a dim formation of what I think was five points of white (or starlight-like) light moving east to west. I estimate the brightness of each light to be about magnitude 3.0, only slightly brighter than the dimmest stars visible in our local sky at the time. Apparent size of the formation was approximately 1/2-degree, or the size of the full moon. The shape of the formation was initially diamond-shaped but did not remain constant -- the distances between the lights changed rapidly and the overall shape changed to more of a square or trapezoidal shape. There seemed to be a fifth light which may have been ziz-zagging behind the other four. As I stepped out from behind the wall I was using to block nearby streetlights, the lights quickly pulled into line with each other, and distictly resembled a V-formation as viewed from behind and slightly below (i.e. a nearly-horizontal ""V""). The formation faded in the southwest sky (about 240-degrees true) at an elevation of about 30 degrees, appearing to recede into the distance. The formation covered about 30 degrees of the sky in about ten seconds and traversed an arc, the formation's bearing smoothly shifing from west to southwest. (I consulted sky maps after the fact for azimuth/elevation estimates.) The dimness of the objects, combined with their speed and my own perplexity while observing them, make exact recollection of their maneuvers imprecise. During the observation! , I was preoccupied with comprehending what I was seeing. My first thought was high-altitude aircraft or missiles, but the lights' maneuverability ruled that out. About midway through the observation, I thought that the lights took on a slightly ruddy color, and I considered the fact that I was seeing a formation of birds reflecting the orange sodium vapor streetights of the city. I tried to make out flapping wings or some type of form but could not -- to move that quickly across the sky and relative to one another, birds would have to be fairly low and, given the brightness of the sky (residual twilight, urban light pollution and full moon), I should have been able to make out silhouettes. I am a radio broadcast engineer by trade with a lifelong interest in science and astronomy. I have seen many things in the sky (yes, I've even seen the insect-eating UFOs in Excalibur's spotlight in Vegas), but nothing I could not identify. I don't know what I saw tonight, but that may be due to the short observation time and faintness of the objects. I am submitting this report in the event that it corroborates other reports.

I am writing this note after much anguish and deliberation.  I am not one to believe in this sort of thing, but the night of June 19 changed my life forever. I was driving down a road in the county coming home from a late night at work, when I thought I saw some lights over the trees in the distance.  I did not think too much about it, because I knew I was near the airport.  So I drove on for about 2 more miles, listening to my scanner.  Suddenly the channels started changing rapidly and the damn thing went nuts. Static, squeals, etc...  I was about to reach down and turn the thing off when the engine on my van quit.  The lights went out, and I rolled to a stop on the side of the road.  I tried and tried but the van would not start. I sat there for a moment, I got out my wireless phone, but it would not work, no signal nothing.  I was getting a bit pissed.  That is when I felt like I was being watched. Every hair left on my head stood straight up. Like when a baloon is rubbed on your head.  I heard a really loud noise, then nothing.  The van started, the scanner started too.  I had no idea what had happened, but I was tired and decided to go on home. When I got home, all the lights were out.  I went in and asked my wife why she went to bed so early. She said 'Early? It's 12:30!'.  Well I nearly fell over. I checked my watch and it said 10:45! I got really concerned that I had blacked out or something, but I have no history of this. Then I started thinking maybe I was abducted by aliens! Then I thought I must be nuts!  I have struggled with this incident for a couple of weeks. I cannot sleep, I cannot eat, I have strange dreams. I feel like I am losing my mind, So at the sueggestion of a friend, I decided to write you guys instead of just putting a bullet in my head. I cannot figure out what happened to those two hours. They are just gone..... I am not nuts, or on medications, but I feel like I am getting worse everyday... Please help! You can call me at work toll free if you like. 1-800-((number deleted))

I was out playing catch with my dad at dusk, when I noticed a bright object, nearly due south of my house, appear very near & below the moon (within the diamater of the moon below the moon) in the sky.  In appearance, it looked like a meteor or light reflecting off of a missile or the fusilage of a shiny airliner. In this first object, there was a bright light at the front, and two smaller lights very close in a line behind (in reference to its direction of travel), which made it appear to be the tail of a meteor (but they did not change in relationship to the front light, so I've pretty much ruled that out). The lights were nearly the same color as the yellowish-red type of street light (high pressure sodium, I believe). There was no sound, nor was there a vapor trail. The object traveled in a mostly west & slightly south direction. When the object reached approximately south-southwest of my house, the 3 lights appeared to move closer together, until you could only see 1 light. This 1 light appeared to grow *at least* 4 times brighter than the 3 lights combined. It stayed bright for a period of time, maybe 10-15 seconds, then it dimmed to the brightness of the original light (the one in front without the 2 behind). It continued to move in the same mostly west, slightly south, direction until it faded out of sight (presumably from going further away). Just before the first object faded out completely, my dad looked at the spot where it appeared, just below the moon, & saw another object. This second object was *identical* in appearance & motion, including having the 3 lights combine into one, grow bright, & continue west until fading out of sight. At a similar interval (just before the second object faded completely), the third object appeared. It was sighted just above & to the left of the moon & traveled in exactly the same direction & approximately the same speed as the first two objects (presumably it was in pursuit). This third object was quite obviously a plane, as vapor trails and wings were evident. However, the leading edge glowed in 3 places a *bright* red, approximately the same hue as a bright red car, or a fresh cherry. I assume the bright red in front, was a reflection of the now set sun. I am no expert in finding velocities of flying objects, but if all three were plane sized, I approximate their speed at around 5-600mph, & an altitude of 30,000 to 45,000 feet. At no time did any of the objects change speed or direction of flight. My very first impression of these objects was that they were planes that had the setting sun's light reflecting off of them. But there were no vapor trails (except for the 3rd object), no strobe lights, no sound & no wings or tail (except the 3rd object, where we could clearly see wings). A few moments later an airliner flew directly overhead & it was very clear that this was an airplane, we could see the full length of the fusilage, the tail, both wings & a vapor trail. But the first two objects are very puzzling to us; they definitely fit the under the category of Unidentified Flying Objects.

I did and started listening to a series of events that began with a missile site losing power and a strike team being dispatched to the site only to see this saucer shaped device hovering over the site.  When the team was ordered to advance onto the site, the device backed away and power returned as soon as it was away from the site.

In a clear sky,(no scopes, just my naked eyes), saw a triangular ""shadow"", blocking the stars- it seemed to move at about the same velocity as a mid-sized passenger jet, low altitude, no noise. From my point, it seemed to bank right sharply for a short distance, and I lost sight of it. I would have difficulty trying to guess it's size and speed.

My girl friend and I saw 2 ufo's. I observed them from the other side of the lake I was staying at. They looked about 3-4 miles away. I stayed at Salmon lake in a cabin for a week with my family, so that is why I do not have all the location information. I had never seen anything like them before, looking at them made me afraid, for whatever reasons I am still trying to understand. The lights were near the horizon and very bright. The light they emitted was a white light. The first light I saw was the brightest. It cast a reflection on the lake. It had 3 different shapes that it kept alternating into every few minutes. The first shape looked like two balls that were stuck together, then it appeared to move closer to me and would turn into a five point star, then it appeared to be moving farther away from me and change into a fine point of light. The light did have an aura around, but you had to look hard to see it. The light appeared to be stationary. A few times it did move rather rapidly, but would stay in near the same place as it moved. The first time I saw it move was when it made a figure 8. A few other times it moved ever so slightly, but didn't really go anywhere. It also made a few ""sparkles"" but that only happened when other aircraft came near it. I saw 5-6 planes go near the two objects, it was hard to see them becuase that didn't have very bright lights flashing like most air liners you see. The planes could have been from the military, it looked like one of them shot a missile at it one time, (that is when I saw the first ""sparkle"") but I dont know if that idea would be true, or becusae I have wathced to many ""UFO"" shows in the past. The 2nd ufo I saw was higher in the sky than the 1st, and it stayed in the same spot the whole time I was watching. It was not as bright and was about 1/2 the size as the 1st light. It had a shape of the two balls stuck togther the whole time. I didn't see the lights come in. I just had gone outside and saw them. I didn't see them leave either. I had watched them for a couple hours and the desire for sleep took over since my family was leaving early in the morning to head back to where I live. I would have stayed to see them depart, but they didnt show any signs of leaving...I could have been there till daylight watching them, or maybe just a few more minutes. I guess I will never know.

On 09/06/2001, at 0550 hours (EDST) myself and several witnesses viewed a ""missile-shaped"" object just south of Waterford, CT over Long Island Sound.  I am the Armed Response Force Team Leader at Millstone Nuclear in Waterford, CT and several of the witnesses are Armed Response Force Members and/or Licensed Nuclear Reactor Operators. From a distance of approximately one half mile, we witnessed what, at first, appeared to be a rapidly approaching plane heading toward our facility from the direction of Orient Point Long Island, NY.  This appeared as a very bright light approximately 300-400 feet above sea level, moving toward us at a high rate of speed.  The object was flying parallel to the ground at this height until it reached a distance approximately 1/4 mile from our shorline.  It then began a trajectory at approximately 60-70%, still headed in a North-Easterly direction (toward Providence, RI).  At this point, we were able to discern the outline of the object.  It was approximately 35-40' in length and shaped very much like a rocket or missile.  It had a four-fin tail end and swept back wings near the front end.  The wings extended back and outward from the body, but we could not discern the distance they extended outward. As the object began to gain altitude, there were red sparks and bluish/white smoke erupting from the rear.  Although the flight path maintained a North-East bearing, it was evident that the object was not flying in a straight-line manner once it began its' ascent.  The flight path became somewhat erratic as the object continued to gain altitude and proceded northward.  Because of the amount of contrail (which remained visible in the sky for nearly an hour) and the amount of flame being emitted, many of us were convinced the object was going to crash.  Many of the witnesses are former Naval Nuclear personnel and most thought the object was a ""Polaris-type"" missile or some other type of nautically-luanched device.  The weather conditions at the time of this incident were clear, mild, and very little wind,  The air temperature was approximately 60 degrees Farenheit.  There were no other objects visible in the sky and the sun was just rising above the horizon to our East.  we were able to view the object for approximately ane and one-half minutes prior to it becoming indistinct. Because we are a Federally Regulated Nuclear Facility, I made immediate notification to the FAA.  The FAA made inquiries to all the airports on the North East Corridor and none reported any planes down or in trouble at the time of the sighting, however, the FAA had recieved several other phone calls conerning this incident.  The FAA called me back about an hour later and suggested I file this report.","Armed Response Force Commander",20,1,"cigar",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"We suspect the witnesses observed the object that was reported by the U.

Me and my husband were driving back from vacation.  We had been driving out of the LA area on I-5 north and entering the little mountainous section leading into the Angeles National Forrest Area and Pyrmaid lake area.  The time was just before dark when I had been starring out the window and noticed that toward the coast there was someting in the air which wasn't very normal.  It seemed to be in the shape of some sort of missile and was on a very subtle donward trajectory.  It was very obviously not a plane and my husband who is an engineer also agreed that it wasn't a plane and also thought it kind of looked like a missile.  I have to admit that it freaked me out and I really didn't want to drive further. Anyway, we kept driving and when we were heading into grapevine California which is just over tejon pass and into the valley we started to encountered black smoke like something was burning  but apparently there was no fire so the source is unknown but we no longer saw what appeared to us to be a missile either.  .Anyway, this had both of us quite alarmed and freked out so we stopped in a parking lot to calm down a bit and as we sat in the car we saw a small ball f light flash and dissappear with incredible speed that surprised both of us and this light seemed to come from no where as well.  That is about al I have to say about what i saw except that it was very freaky and I probably will not be forgetting it anytime soon.

Saturday, January 30th ((sic??)), 2001, approximate time - 7:15PM The sun had set with only the slightest pale blue afterglow in the West horizon. The sky was perfectly clear with many stars visible. I was out on my back deck with 2 friends having dinner.

I was leaning back in my chair admiring the clear night sky when I saw an extremely bright white falling star streak across the Eastern horizon moving incredibly fast toward the south. It was literally only visible for 1 second, but left a long streak across my retina. I remarked excitedly for my 2 friends to look, but it was already too late. It was only because of the falling star that we saw what happened next.

For the next minute we all stood there craning our necks staring at the sky. At this time, there appeared a passenger plane at cruising altitude over to the east, moving slowly towards the NW.

Literally less than a minute passed before the friend to my immediate left said ""What's that?"" and pointed straight up. I had been looking toward the East where I saw the shooting star, but I looked straight up and saw what she was talking about. The third person with us never saw anything, because the event was over in just a few seconds, and she never locked on.

Basically, this is what we saw: Directly overhead there was a formation of very pale greenish dots. They appeared to be very high, but immediately looked very strange and unlike anything I had seen before. The lights didn't appear to be navigation lights, as they weren't points of light, like on a plane, but actual round shapes. Also, the light itself was very strange, because unlike stars, especially falling stars, and/or lights from a plane, they were very pale against the black sky - almost stealthy. It was as if the objects themselves were glowing, and giving off an eerie glow or haze immediately around each shape, as opposed to having lights on the surface.

The shapes were arranged in a wedge formation, with a point craft, and 3 more falling back on the right side at a 45 degree angle, and 1 off the point on the left side at a matching opposed angle. 5 objects total. They were close together, and looked like a formation that fighter jets might have flown in, but nothing (in my opinion) man-made could possibly move that fast, and there was no sonic boom or any other noise from them.

They flew in a perfectly straight line heading north. They were moving so fast that they literally flew across the whole sky and out of our sight in less than 4 seconds! It was amazing! To give you a reference, the commercial aircraft literally had moved maybe 3 inches across the sky from our perspective in the time it took these objects to span the entire expanse of the open sky and disappear into the horizon, and it was visible to us for several minutes after the formation vanished.

Naturally, we started yelling ""Oh my God - did you see that???"" and the like, and found out that unfortunately only 2 of us had seen them. We compared what we saw, and every last detail, including the arrangement and color of the objects was identical. I racked my brain to try to figure out what it could have been, but couldn't think of anything that made sense. If a shooting star hit the atmosphere and broke apart, it is highly unlikely that the peices would have formed a perfectly spaced formation, and would have been bright white in color, like a magnesium fire, not pale green. If it was a missile, again, why the formation and the color? I am sure it wasn't a plane because of the impossible velocity.

I was very curious to see if anyone else saw these objects, as it was a warm night and I'm sure there were thousands of people like us out enjoying the weather. Also, the passenger plane was in the vicinity, and flying in a trajectory that would have eventually intersected with the path the formation had flown, so I wondered if they could have seen them too.

It was so strange and awesome that I literally was beside myself for a few minutes, but now I am stuck in a rut where I want to tell people that I am pretty sure I saw something unnatural, but am afraid of being ridiculed. I would love to find out what it was if there is an explanation! So there you have it.","Software Sales",2,5,"formation",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Witness states dates of January 30 and September 30.  We presume he means September 30.

My parents related this to me when I was 8 or 9 years old.  They were driving northbound on US-1 in the early AM in the dark before sunrise in the vicinity of what is now known as Pinecrest. In the 1960's, it was a semi-rural area.  My dad spotted what he thought was an aircraft to the north of their position.  He said it was a very bright white light that stayed in one position.  He assumed that it was an airplane with its landing lights on heading for Miami International Airport. When it didn't appear to turn he was afraid that it may be making an emergency landing on the highway! As my mom and dad became concerned, the object shot away to the west at incredible speed. My dad said that it left like a bullet shot from a gun, leaving only a line in the sky. This was no airplane.

While observing the meteor storm from my decidedly bad vantage point (inner city, facing northwest), I noticed a slow-moving object high up in the sky.  The object was crescent-shaped, colored a medium grey (judging by the color reflected from the city lights below), and seemed to have a texture like it was made from dozens of small balls or spheres.

It flew very slowly from north-northeast to south-southwest, and was accompanied by a very faint rumbling, engine-like noise which I could make out over the normal nighttime sounds of downtown Seattle.  Once it was nearly overhead, it turned slowly west and faded from view, and the rumbling noise faded away with it.

The size was approximately that of a thumbnail held at arm's length, and it flew with the rounded portion of the crescent shape aimed forward.  There were no light emitters of any type visible on it.

Its height could not be accurately estimated; I have only the amplitude of its ""engine"" noise to base any guess upon.  And if I tried to guess using only that, it would have been at least 5,000 feet in altitude.

I'm on the approach path for commercial airliners, and I know what they look and sound like from varying distances.  This was *not* a commercial flight.

According to my handheld GPS, I'm located at 47?36'23N by 122?19'51W.  This is in downtown Seattle near the monorail terminus.

This is the first of three unidentifyable objects I will be reporting on tonight.

Incidentally, from my decidedly poor vantage point, highly restricted viewable area, and severe light pollution conditions, I still observed approximately 150 meteors between 1am & 4am; with only one being very substantial. The projectile itself glowed an eye-piercing whitish violet and was surrounded by a darker violet coma; and the long tail was green & white with violet & blue-violet along its edges.  It's a fair guess it left some elements in our upper atmosphere that aren't even on the periodic table yet.  All but three of the meteors I saw were Leonids.","Museum curator",1,1,"other",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2001,2000,4,11,2,"Night","West",0,1,0,0,0

It was late at night and some of my friends and I were looking at constellations. My wife pointed out to me a ""moving star"". I noticed it and told her it was a satellite and resumed my star-gazing. In a very short time, 1 or 2 minutes, she said it ""changed directions very quickly"". I then started watching the object. The object seemed extremely high in the atmosphere. It would move in one steady direction, then, as if it were tired of doing that, it would take a quick 90 degree turn in another direction. Then one of my friends noticed another object, then another. There were now a total of 3 moving ""stars"". They roamed around a bit going one direction then another. They would also be moving east, then immediately go 180 degrees towards the west. They then seemed to group in a very large triangle after about 10 minutes of our observance. When they finally were in the triangle formation, they would move back and forth very rapidly from east to west in the 180 degree fashion. I am not gullable, nor do I jump to conclusions. This was the FIRST ufo sighting I have ever witnessed. It was very odd and I now have chills reporting this. The only theory I have come up with in the past 3 weeks since the incident is that they were some sort of military craft like a star-wars anti-missile(ICBM) craft.

My sister and I had just finished watching the Blues/Avalanche NHL playoff game on TV (which ended abruptly in overtime) and as I was frustrated that my team lost, I immediately proceeded to get ready to drive my sister home to St. Paul. She went outside ahead of me, while I grabbed a quick glass of water for the road. It was about 2134 CST on May 18, 2001.

A few seconds later she yelled for me to hurry and take a look at something which was moving slowly almost directly overhead in the sky (which was clear). I stepped out of the doorway and looked up. What we saw for the next 6 minutes is as follows: A large object almost directly overhead, slightly east of our position, which was at a point just west of Interstate 35W and just south of US Highway 10 in Mounds View, Minnesota, USA. As I have been trained in this area, I estimated this object to be at an altitude of somewhere between 8000 to 10000 feet. The object first appeared as an oddly shaped rectangle though roundish on the bottom, with a deep-orange seemingly pulsating or shimmering underbelly, similar to a liquid metal appearance, with what appeared to be brighter orange highlites (which appeared as possibly tubular openings) in the front end which I viewed just prior to it passing overhead, which then hid those frontal features. It also appeared to have a halo, or jellyfish type of bubble on the top of the object well above the shimmering orange bottom.

It was moving very slowly from the east to the west/northwest, and made no sound, and no other lights of any kind were visible, though its general shape seemed to ebb as its orange underside was unstable as it was pulsating slowly.

As this was something that I have never witnessed before, it seemed significant enough for me to dash inside to grab my video camera, and I  was fortunate enough to tape nearly two minutes of this object.

After taping this object for nearly a minute, I was surprised to see that another object seemed to be released from the main object and zip away from it fairly quickly, with this splitting visible in the frames prior to my nervous jerking of the camera to get a better angle as it was moving behind trees. Within seconds, the object released an additional two (possibly three) objects which are clearly visible on the tape. These objects seemed to fall in a downward motion though they could have been moving into the distance. One object is shown to fall off vertically behind trees while it suddenly reappears a second later moving horizontally and completely disappearing a few seconds later. This also is clearly visible.

During this second release of smaller objects, there was no apparent change in the main object's structure, though it seemed with the naked eye to dim slightly after the release.

About thirty seconds later, the main object then split into two major sections and the sped off in opposite trajectories from each other though in a seemingly downward motion in relation to the camera's angle, which was pointed upward at an approximate 45 degree angle in relation to the ground. The objects then disappeared from view behind trees.

I have estimated that in relation to the camera's angular position, that this object split apart in the vicinity of Coon Rapids, Anoka, or Champlin, Minnesota, or in that general region, to the northwest of Mounds View.

There were at least three witnesses from our location: myself, my twenty-year old sister, and my forty-nine year old then roommate, who only saw the object briefly. I yelled for another individual who had been entering his vehicle a half-block away to look, but the person either didn't understand or didn't fully hear me trying to get his attention.

My personal credentials include military service in the United States Army as an MOS 16T10 (Patriot Missile). As this is an Air Defense position, I was specifically trained to spot and identify all known types of aircraft and other flying objects (balloons, missiles, drones, military flares, meteorological phenomona, etc.). Despite my background, I have no experience with the object I witnessed this particular evening. I can personally attest to the facts presented herein, and can faithfully presume that it was not an aircraft, nor a ""shooting star"" (meteorite), nor a military flare, and certainly not a weather balloon (the wind was blowing from the west to east at about 10-15 mph yet the object was moving east to west/northwest -into the wind). Additionally, the sun had already set, yet the object was luminescent or emitting its own light on the side not facing the sunset.

At the same time that this object was sighted, I did notice a high-flying commercial jetliner that was flying from west to east at an approximate altitude of 36,000 feet, and was visible from its exhaust contrail.

In terms of its possible size, I would judge this object as it first appeared overhead to be the size of between a 747-400 and a C-5A military transport aircraft. The object certainly was well below the altitude of the high-flying commercial jet which was moving in the opposite direction.

To describe its size in a simple form, if you basically stretched both arms over your head and put two thumbs (and possibly another half of one thumb) next to each other, that's the size it appeared at its closest point.

I wanted to share this story with your investigators and the general public because I felt that it was significant enough to warrant further investigation to determine what the object could possibly have been, and as to whether there were other witnesses ( which I have noticed that there was another sighting in the St. Paul, Minnesota suburb of Hastings about 2 hours previous to mine with a similar description) and if there have been other similar sightings with similar object behavioral characteristics.

There has been some local investigation by the Minnesota MUFON network field investigator, and he is apparently still putting the finishing touches on his report.

I am highly interested in knowing if your organization has connections to those who may have experience with video tapes, and who would be interested in examining the tape to determine the light source evident on it, and possibly enhancing the tape to show more detail.

Thank you for your efforts regarding this.

In closing, I would also like to share that within a few days of this sighting, I made attempts to get local media coverage of this sighting. Copies of the tape were made in the studios of KARE 11 (NBC affiliate), WCCO 4 (CBS affiliate), and KSTP 5 (ABC affiliate). None of the organizations returned any information regarding the sighting for a possible story, which I find highly unusual.

I also contacted the local air traffic control center, which is a major regional center located in Farmington, Minnesota. They told me to contact the control tower at MSP (Minneapolis/St. Paul International). I spoke to a supervisor (whose name I'll give if needed) there regarding possible radar tapes from that evening to see if an object was sighted, but was told a few days later that nothing unusual was on those tapes.

I am also interested in what local television weather radar, NWS radar, and NOAA weather radar scans show for that specific time period on 18 May 01.

Thank you once again.","Corporate Executive",3,1,"rectangle",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2001,2000,2,5,21,"Evening","Midwest",0,1,0,0,0

It is not unsual to see this type plane circling high above our place.  We live 45 miles North of the Panama City Ariport.  A little after I glanced up at the plane an object flew between me and the plane toward the south at a tremendous rate of speed.  I hardly had time to focus on it before it flew out of sight over the south horizon.  It was black and had a slight rectangular shape without wings or lights.  I estimated it to be about the size of a car, but it could have been much larger. I probably focused on it no more than 5 seconds. It made no sound and travelled much faster than any conventional craft that I have ever seen in my 63 years. It flew as straight as an arrow. I would never have known it was there if I had not already been looking at the nearby plane.

I was lying there listening to the radio when the disc jocky made a comment about a phone call of someone reporting a ufo around one of the parks that we lived close to. This stured my interest so I got out of bed and went into the front yard which faced the park in reference. At first look i only saw a light that appeared to be a bright star but of a bluewhite color. After several minutes of watching this one light which was constant, I noticed that it was moving in my direction, slowly. I would est. at this point it was about 300 to 500 ft. off the gound.

It stayed at this position for quiet sometime. I had gone inside to get my deer rifle to use the scope for better vision, didnt work to good so i got my binoculars, this gave me much better vision of the ! object.

I would say it was approx. 25'-30' in dia. disc shaped and appeared to have a port hole or window on the upper side of the object. What I didnt notice that it now was about 200 ft. of the ground moving straight toward me, its speed had slowed to only several mph. Its skin appeared to be metalic with a very low luster, it appeared to absorbe light rather than reflect it. There was absolutely no noise, no visual signs of proplusion,prop,engines, exhaust etc. No rotor blades, no vertical or horizonal stabelizers. To put it bluntly it was a flying saucer perfectly still 200 ft. over my house at 3:00am in the morning. At this point my wife totally lost it running back into the house. I was able to get her back out in the front yard to help me with the id so we wouldnt forget anything. After 10 min or so it began to move to the east again straight over my house, when it passed over us looking straight up at the object we felt a little sick to our stomachs and we felt like we were in a vaccuum. As it passed over our house we ran through the house into the back yard to continue watching. It continued for about 400 yards at this slow rate of speed when all of a sudden its speed went from a few mph to an unadentified speed which I can only relate to that of a meteror, tail and all. It traveled straight for a sec then started in an upward motion at about 45 deg. heading straight up then disappearing into the clouds. No noise, no light other than the one i have explained did we observe. The next day or two someone called the local newspaper and reported seeing the object at the park close to the ground.

I saw fire ball.  At first I thoutght it was a shooting star, but it turn around for some seconds, and I saw the smoke.

I am not sure that was UFO or not, but it was something strange.

I was watching northern lights at that time, and beside me two men whom I don't know were there. I didn't hear any sounds because my car was making noise, but two other men said that made sounds.


((QUERY TO ANOTHER WITNESS TO SAME EVENT))

Dear Ms. ((name deleted)), 

Thank you very much for the excellent report!  In fact, we received one other report from Fairbanks. 

From your description, I wonder whether the event might have been caused by a rocket launch of some kind.  Are you able to make a telephone call, or two, to establish whether that might have been the cause?  I suspect a call to the FAA would resolve the issue fairly quickly, since any facility launching a missile would have to apprise the FAA of the event. 

If you find out what the cause was, I would be most grateful if you could drop us a note.  We will add it to your report. 

((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM OTHER WITNESS))

Mr. Davenport,

I did phone the FAA (ATC at FAI) this evening and was told that the research facility out at Poker Flats (an atmospheric research center about 30 miles north of my home) was potentially active at that time (the NOTAM filed by Poker Flats is open-ended) though none of the same staff was on tonight so we we're unable to verify.  Poker Flats does apparently occasionally launch small rockets into the atmosphere for research.  The FAA employee also stated that the research does ""effect the Northern Lights"" which may have something to do with the good lights show last night (actually now I'm more interested by that...  ;)    The specs would certainly seem to line up with where and what I saw.  Thank you for your reply and suggestion.   All the best to you.

I was watching a fantastic northern lights show tonight when I saw condensed light out of the corner of my eye.  I looked up to see a cigarish light moving across the sky.  I was fortunate in that I was holding binoculars at the time and was able to focus in on the object as is tracked from north to south.  The light was actually flame as one would think a pair of rocket boosters would produce.  I watched it move for maybe fifteen more seconds and then the 'boosters' went out and as they did an orangish glow remained for an instant (there was a shape momentarily visible in the afterglow that reminded me of a branding iron pointing directly at me shaped like a square with a cross through the center) and then the entire object disappeared into the night.   I can guess latXlong and make a sketch if requested via email.

The right corner craft would leave the formation... and slowly follow the air traffic lane, whice goes right through there, then suddenly reappear near the triangle again. sometimes electricity could be seen around the red light on the ground..then a small red light would come out of it. and see to float to a craft alongside the triangle hovering amoungst the tree top level.

Occurred on Lighthouse Road near Fort Mott State Park. Object was red, with no visible lighting or running lights, discernable ""deck"" lights, or other indications of being a multi-leveled ""craft."" Its shape was that of two plates, one atop the other; wide in the center and tapering to ends; which appeared to be a consistant trait in its construction (angle/position to/of object did not change appearence). At first it approached low  (-300') and silently from SW (?-directions aren't my thing!). While manuevering, there was no apparent change in the objects relationship to the observer (it was as though It was ""facing"" us even as it changed direction... perhaps- likely, the effect of no identifiable markings from which to ascertain its true orientation. Though there were no ""visible"" indications of an aura or haze that I readily remember- it seemed pretty clear too Me!... I reckon' one may have existed: that would explain the lack of definition and inability to denote any change in orientation during course changes/manuevers.

We were at the bend of Lighthouse Road near Fort Mott Road, facing field (lighthouse to left)away from developement. It was coming  (slight angle to right- 1 or 2 degrees relative, travelling left and closing, toward Zero relative)  directly towards us and those with me were quite concerned. I at the time was 14 and quite curious, and got out of the car (a VW) to ""see it!"". I was pulled into the car and in the excitement (panic) to get away, my cousin nearly ran off the road and into a ditch. I observed the object as it gradually turned 180 degrees from us (to the right and away from our original observation point) and headed to the actual park area (app. relative bearing from original ob. point: 045). It then proceeded (North?) from park area and while over the dike began to accelerate (acceleration was smooth and rapid- in a ""up-river"" direction towards Wilmington, DE... North?). Then it was gone! Not a streak as seen in (say) a rapidly moving light... just a clean, crisp light which increased in speed and disappeared. Note: The object did not diminish in mass or change shape indicating a turning/arching motion, nor did it fade or in any respect give the impression of a light being turned off! Never did I hear noise, nor did it behave in a manner consistant with any aircraft of my knowledge, before or after the event. Other than to say it appeared considerably close, I can only speculate on its size, distance, and altitude [2 inches- 1/2 the spread of one's fingers if taking bow readings on a ship (Ex: four points off the Starboard bow), at a distance of approximately 1000 yds., and altitude of app. 200 feet. Closest approximate distance was 150 yds. I would estimate the object itself to have been the length of a medium-sized house: 40 feet? ]... this account is from memory, and except for it being ""somehow strange and out of place,"" I didn't think to correlate the incident with known landmarks for size, altitude, or distance. Quite honestly, I was 14 and fearless... more interested in determining what! it was than how big, high, or where, it was! The conditions of incident: Clear evening. Stars bright. Farmland, swamp, and open ground, which I was relatively familiar with, and no unusual activity of any kind. (Note: Aircraft activity was light, visible, and easily recognizable as aircraft, though distant; Delaware side of Delaware River- refinery and Wilmington area, with some air traffic in the vicinity of the Nuclear Power Plant).

Events prior to incident/event: My sister and two friends had come home obviously distressed- literally crying because they saw a UFO. My cousin and I, for laughs and kicks decided to go back with them so they could ""show us""... they were after a lapse of app. a 1/2 hour, still distressed. Niether of us were expecting anything- we thought they were stoned to be quite honest! Anyhow, what occured is pretty much that as stated herein, and to, the best of my memory.

Since then I've been in the Navy, at Sea, and have seen various types of Aircraft under varying conditions. None of which would fit into the category of unidentifiable or unexplainable! I was a FT (Fire Control Technician-Missiles). I am somewhat imaginative and creative, but not predisposed to irrational thought or fantasy; however, to this day I cannot explain what that object was! It continues to defy any attempt at my rationalizing what it may have been! It truely was uncharacteristic of any aircraft or aerial phenomenon of which I am familiar. A friend that lived in that area said she too saw wierd things, but I mention that in passing! Interesting Note: None of the other four People involved- my sister and cousin specifically, will discuss this incident/event; which really aggrevated me for some time! They acknowledge its occurence, but will not discuss it... which is behavior I find rather strange in and of itself! NUFORC: As stated, this account is from memory and occured some 27 years ago! This is the first I've bothered to report it since it was so long ago and without willing witnesses or supportive evidence seemingly a waste of time. But, why not? It's an incident that too this day, baffles me! I will answer any questions (via E-mail) you may care to ask; though certainly being this far removed from the present, it is of no consequence.

I have refrained from reporting my account of what we witnessed on 6-25-01 because I wanted to wait and see what others would say over a period of 6 months or so, but after almost 9 months now I won't wait any longer.We've kept it to ourselves and swallowed alot of emotions and neither one of has been the same since.         Here is my account  :  My wife and I were sitting on our patio (wich was coastal waterfront facing due East with no obstructions).Our conversation was interupted when this bright light seemingly turned on like a spotlight at a very high altitude.Like others I aggree it looked exactly like a spotlight from a helicopter-- but it was too high in altitude and it made no sense for a chopper to be using a spotlight that high up.There was NO noise at all and it was a crystal clear night without a cloud in the sky,just black sky with many sparkling stars.This light was large enough to make us feel like it was within the atmosphere--- but other characteristics proved me wrong.I knew from experience that on such a quiet clear night a chopper would have to be at 10,000 ft or higher to have NO noise audible.And I believe 10K ft is pretty much the ""useful ceiling or limit"" for the average rotorcraft.And yet a ""chopper"" is the only craft that can ""hover"" in one spot as this one did.(A Harrier jet wouldn't be goofing around hovering at this altitude).

The ""light"" was indeed engulfed in a haze as most others said------ this haze seemed to be pruduced by the light source.The light looked like a flashlight searching in the dark--- it was actually searching around WITHIN it's own sphere of haze/fog and the beam stayed within the haze.

As we staired in amazement we said things like ""Oh my god !!"" But we were at ease and actually had feelings of elation.   At this time the ""beam"" of light found its way to us and ""locked-on"" to us as soon as it crossed our position, and at this time began to move slowly directly towards or ""at"" us.We both had the overwhelming sensation that we were going to quite possibly ""beamed-up"" any second because we had this beam pointed directly at us and the source began to slowly move at us.

Although I didn't want to miss one second of looking at this thing---- I had a realization that if I didn't make an attempt to ""record"" this event in some fashion it may very well be reduced to a fairy-tale story buried in skepticism by all we shared it with.

I knew I had our camcorder literally within 2-3 feet just inside the sliding door and I made a frantic move turn around, throw the door open, reach and grab the camcorder swing back around simultaneously pounding my finger into the ""power"" button to fire it up and DIVE back out onto the patio all in 3-4 seconds.

Well this ""light"" honest-to-god seemed to respond instantly as I pointed at it with the camera and just bursted into deep-space infinity all at once actually FORCING the haze that was surrounding it into a downward spiral/corkscrew fashion--- and as others have  said, this haze/fog lingered for awhile as it decended.The light was instantly gone leaving only the black night sky and stars to see.

In OUR case, the story DOES NOT END HERE !!!!! As we sat in SHOCK and AWE on our patio-- we refused to leave our positions for about an hour thinking it may come back-- but it didn't.

So we went inside to nervously play the tape and see what I got on tape-------- and I actually DID get the last few seconds before it took-off.And to me, the interesting thing on tape was the downward spiral it created in the haze when it accelerated out of there from a stationary position !!! This shows PROPULSION !!            Sorry guys, but NO missile can sit stationary at an outer-atmosphere altitude, then suddenly take off at an immeasurable speed into infinity with NO ""blast"" characteristics behind it, and what does a spotlight have to do with a missile anyway ???????? Something VERY strange happened with our vcr.We tried to turn it off because we were going to bed and it WOULD NOT turn off no matter what buttons we pushed ! I just left it like that and we went to bed.        The next morning we went to watch the tape again and the damn vcr began to chew up the tape !!! I tried to stop it but by the time it was through------ we had lost the EXACT length of tape to get rid of my proof of  what we saw.I thought I was going to drop dead I was so mad--- we have never had a tape get chewded in 20 years of watching videos and this ONLY chewed the ""sighting"" footage part and the rest was fine.The vcr has NEVER acted up again since this and we continue to use it today.

I tried to take the tape to a specialist to try and correct the ""fold"" that resulted in he tape and he said it was not correctable.I still have the 9 foot section of tape sealed in a container and plan to hopefully find someone to restore the tape to ""watchable"" condition.

The reason I know this tape is so important is not only what it shows------- but what it DOESN'T !!  Anyone seeing this tape will know it wasn't a damn missile launch.

I mean C'mon guys, listen to the reports including accounts from 06/07/98----- they don't even ""sound"" like missile launches--- they lack the proper characteristics as even the people who have lived near the Cape for many years and KNOW what launches look like---- have said !! I am asking you guys now how I can ever get the chance to communicate with any of the other people who have sent in reports---- especially the pilots like the one that was flying South and caused you guys to change your explanation at the bottom of each report to state that it was an offshore submarine launch instead of the former KSC launch  ??  Can any of us ""sighters"" communicate with each other and share thoughts on this unique encounter ? Can/will you guys have something set up where someone like myself can talk-to and eventually meet others who saw this ?  Because I want to.

Strange jet-trail-like thing sighted over mountains

At about 6:00 PM, I called my friend to let her know that I was probably going to be late to her house (I was supposed to come over). However, while I was on the phone, my friend was talking and talking about some strange thing in the sky, that she couldn't exactly describe very well. I wasn't so terrified of it, because I wasn't a believer at the time, and I'm still sort of doubting the existence of aliens. Well, my friend was telling of an object that zoomed into the air from the mountains, zig-zagged, and finally disappeared, leaving a very prominent trail. As my friend said, there was a red circle surrounding it, but she wasn't able to describe the circle very well (like whether the circle appeared when the light disappeared, or how big the circle was...etc), so I'm doubting the existence of the red circle in the event. Well, while I was still talking to her on the phone, actually on my cell phone and she on her cordless phone (while she was outside checking out the strange light), our connection began to get more and more static. After a few minutes, Bridget had an idea that she would go and get her dad's digital camera and take a few pictures. This was when the light had disappeared suddenly into the mountains. By this time, it was approx. 6:20. Bridget took the pictures, and after coming over, I was able to see them. When I got to Bridget's house, the jet-trail was still very prominent. The trail just stayed in the air, without leaving until about thirty more minutes later. Also, at the points where the trail began to turn to make the trail a zig-zaggy form, there were bright lights. The top of the trail was already beginning to drift right, because of the wind. My friend and I decided to look at the pictures then. All the pictures that Bridget took of the UFO contained orbs. Bridget took a picture of me then, to check whether the camera lens were dirty or not, and the picture of me came out perfectly fine, and without orbs. After thinking and thinking about this event, I knew that the UFO had b! een in t he Earth's atmosphere, because the wind could blow the jet trail away. The jet trail was vapor, I think, because after thirty more minutes (6:40 PM), the trail had faded. Also, before taking the pictures, when there was still some sunlight left in the sky, my friend and I could see a small rainbow, probably from the sun shining through the prism. I highly doubt this is any UFO event, because we do have a air base near by, and they were probably doing some experiments/tests/launching missiles. But the occurrence just seemed so unnatural, because of it's zig-zag shape and the bright lights at each point, and how the light just disappeared. Another thing I'd like to point out is that my friend, who witnessed the whole thing, saw the light coming from somewhere behind the mountain, meaning it was probably under 2000 feet. Either the UFO landed, or the people at the air base were doing some experiments. Another thing, although this might be totally off subject (but I did hear orbs may have relation to dead people or angels), my friend's friend was shot in the chest, and found on March 14, 2002. My friend found this out March 15, 2002, so perhaps the orbs were intended for my friend (does that make sense?). I just wanted to clear the situation up, so maybe you can help me determine whether the object was an UFO or not one.

Hello, I am a recent engineering graduate from USC. I  live near University of Southern California (USC).  I  witnessed a very strange object today on the skies of Los Angeles on the west horizon. It was a very bright object, a intensely and brightly glowing object, moving at nearly at the speed of fast low flying airplane. It was moving in an zig zag pattern and left a long trail(zig zag). This object suddenly disappeared in a fraction of second as if it dissolved into skies. This event took place, I mean I saw it at 6.25 pm 15th March 2002 for nearly 30 sec,it may have been visible for more time. I am sure it was not a air plane, or a missile or weather balloon or meteor, because all of this make a straight smoke trail and this object made zigzag trail. Other thing  which suggested that it was an unusual object was the way this object disappeared in a fraction of second. The trails of this object could be seen clearly till 6.55 pm, till it became too dark. This object was moving from North- north-west towards south and the trail could be seen starting from same directions. Other details: 1: Though it is difficult for me to tell you the exact altitude but I can explain you in relative terms. The point at which the object vanished from the skies (6.25PM), I could see the moon nearby rising at the same point (6.40PM).

Assuming that the object was directly above the sea shore, which is around 11miles straight from the place where I live and applying Pythagoras theorem the distance above the earth comes out to be 8.4 miles taking 35 degree angle and 6.9 miles above the  earth taking the angle as 30 degree.

2: Taking West as the horizon the Angle of inclination of the object must be around 35 degrees at the point where it diminished.

3: I was just adjacent to University of Southern California from where I graduated, at the gate  of my house. (Latitude = 34.020N Longitude = 118.29W approx.) I believe that the object must be above the pacific ocean or could be within the coast, but for sure not too much within the coast at the time it vanished.

4: At the time when I saw this object I was coming from the University, walking, after playing tennis there and when I saw this happen I was just infront of my house.

Ok, as a skeptic (most UFOS I would think are merely military dirigibles and unmanned drones) I wasn't really certain what i and my girlfriend had seen.  We pulled out of the Holland Tunnel in downtown NYC not far from Canal street, on our way to Brooklyn.  It was a beautiful day as the sun was shining and visibility was straight up (10,000ft ceiling maybe), and no cloud cover.  We were sitting in traffic for oh, maybe 2 minutes when something just above a building across from us caught my eye.  The distance, ground, was maybe 100 yards to the building, and vertically maybe 12 stories high.  The sun wasn't shining in our eyes nor was there any glare to obscure our clear path of vision.  This thing behaved like a living creature, it sat in the air just above this building and slowly rose and began to move horizontally over canal street.  Immediately i asked my girlfriend to look and comment on what she thought it was (still sitting in traffic we had ample time to peep it).  Her initial comment was that it was a string of black balloons floating carelessly in the air and rising upward, made sense to me judging its appearance, BUT balloons wouldn't behave like this thing did!  This idea of it being balloons was dashed against the rocks due to it's size and nature....was maybe 45 feet in length and altered its shape.  

Allow me to explain in bulleted points: 

1.  The object was hovering in place and changed direction a few times smoothly, against the breeze which was blowing.  Did not react to wind direction or speed, as the wind would gust.

2.  Object was close enough to the street (like 100 feet) that it would be affected by same wind we were.

3.  Was jet black and appeared to be almost like a giant oarfish moving in the air in a twisting fashion.  This thing had what seemed specific motions which were repeated over and over such as a sidewinder snake moves...deliberate and repetitive.

4.  Would stop, hover, twist, move, stop, hover, twist, move, etc. all the while changing shape from long and snakelike to rectangular and spherical.

5.  After floating and shape shifting above and around building (it wasnt tethered as the wind would whip it a certain way)it moved ""fast"" (maybe within 2 secinds time) the length of 3 blocks NE, then stopped to begin its dance again.  Then moved an opposite direction just as quickly and stopped.

As it moved on it began to head due NE towards the east side and east river then ultimately dissappeared behind a large building maybe 6 blocks from my car, at this time it reached an altitude of maybe 350 feet then just vanished.  By now i had cars honking behind me followed by a barrage of profanity, so i had to move.

Strangest thing i've ever seen...it truely looked like a snake or oarfish/eel floating in air anyone else see this thing?!

I was at the statesville airport with my young daughter. It was a clear day with a few clouds in the sky. I was parked north of the runway on Aviation Drive. I was listening to my radio shack 200 channel scanner model#20-312, which Icarry in my personal vehicle to listen to air traffic communications. The frequency for the Statesville airport is 123.05.

I observed a Beachcraft KingAir 200 airplane takeoff on runway 28and head in a westerly direction. I viewed the take off through my binoculars a pair of bushnells model#13-7016. I had used the zoom lens to zoom in on the airplanes takeoffs (7-15/35 zoom). Using my scanner, I listened to student pilots getting clearances fo their takeoffs and landings. ACessna 172 skyhawk was holding on runway 28 to let a Robinson R22 Beta helicopter land. Shortly after landing, the helicopter took off again and headed south and turned east past the airport. It then turned north and then west for final approach to runway 28. It then hovered while the Cessna followed the same pattern. At the same time, another Cessna 182 skyhawk recieved clearance and tookoff.I was still watching the helicopter and the first cessna in my binoculars, when the second Cessna took off. I followed it up about 20-25feet off the runway. At this point, I saw a black sphere about the size of a BB bullet off in the distance behind the airplane. The object hovered for about a second and then accelerated quickly from the southeast to the north. It was just a little norteast of my position when it disappeared behind the trees. The object was 15-20 degrees above the horizon and from the first time I saw it to it disappeared was 10-15 seconds.

Even with using the binoculars, I was unable to find a rudder, a contrail or after burner exhaust. I feel certain that it was not a B-2 Spirit, which I had seen at a Concord airport airshow back in May 2000. The B-2 started out looking like a black line in the sky until it got closer to you. The craft I observed had no lights or reflection from the sun which was at 45-50 degrees in the south/southeast sky.

To Whom It May Concern: I have never reported anything like this before.

I would like to report a sighting of two star-like objects heading southeast this evening at 20:20 over Lakewood, CO.

My wife confirmed this sighting by cell phone from a separate location and I spoke to a man at a convenience store who also witnessed it as it happened.

Would Peterson AFB or Norad be able to confirm this sighting on radar? Here is a complete description of the sighting.

As I drove west of Denver on Hwy 6 at about 20:20 Mountain time on 4/17/02, I was looking at the western sky at dusk to see if I could observe an astronomical event of planets aligning (see astronomical bulletins).  As I looked up again I noticed two star-like lights traveling at what appeared to be a very high altitude and very high rate of speed (above 200 mph at least).  They had no blinking lights but were apparently luminescent.  They remained equidistant apart and were traveling in a southeast direction.  I happened to be on my phone with my wife, who was traveling on I-25 North (about 10 minutes from where I was)at the time of my sighting.  I told her about it and then pulled over to get gas and get out of my car to look at it.  I saw the lights continue Southeast so I yelled over to a man getting out of his truck and asked if he could see these objects.  He stated he could.  I asked him if he knew what they were and he stated that he did not know.  He appeared interested and then went into the convenience store.  I started pumping gas and called my wife again and asked if she could see the lights.  She responded that she could and she pulled off the highway to get a better look.  She stated that they continued on their way in a southeastern direction at a constant rate of speed and distance apart until out of sight.  My reaction during the sighting was one of calm surprise and excitement to confirm it's existence with my wife.  I was also excited that my wife would take notice of something like this at the end of the day going home from work.

I was over at my friends house about to go night fishing. When we got to the lake we started to fish. After about 10 to 15 minutes, I started to get bored and so I went to the top of a hill to put away my gear. To the left of my eye, I saw an orange bright light circling a spotlight (the ones that shine up in the sky to attract people that goes back and forth). Whenever the object circled around the light at a slower speed it got brighter. Whenever The object circled at a faster speed it got darker. I told my friend to come up to the top of the hill with his sisters. He saw the object and said it is probably a helicopter or something like that. I asked him if he wanted to go to his house to go get his video camera just in case it was a U.F.O. Since his house was about a block away, we had to walk pretty fast in order to catch the object on tape. As we started to walk to my friends house we noticed it started to follow us at a high rate of speed because the object was about a mile away when it was circling the light. My friend, his sisters and I stopped dead in our tracks when we saw it had caught up with us. The object was hovering to the left of us about 300 feet above the ground about 500 feet away from us. Then the object turned toward us. It was a triangle shape with a orange light on the top corner, a blue light on the bottom left corner and a red light on the bottom right corner. Then the object slowly drifter toward us with no sound at all. The object stopped about 300 feet away from us then it turned around 180 degrees and shot off like a bullet leaving no vapor trail.

I was a church counselor at Forest Home Camp in the San Bernadino mountains. A group of 7th graders were supposed to swim in a lake on the mountain top, but moss or scum was on our side of the lake, so we just started talking. The subject was Hawaiian dancing, I remember, and suddenly, one little boy screamed, ""Hey! Look at THAT!!!!"" It was silver, and looked like two saucers glued together with windows where they joined.  It was so close, we could see figures at the windows that surrounded the middle seam. This was 1953, and none of us had ever seen anything move like this craft did. It hovered and then it completely disappeared until it hovered diagonally from where we had just seen it. These 7th graders were beside themselves enjoying this unbelievable demonstra- tion of mechanical manuvering. I was awestruck and was sure it belonged to our govern- ment, and how wonderful!  The boys in the group knew it was a UFO, but I didn't until years later. My friend and I went to the Iowa State Fair, and they announced that there was a showing of a guided missile. I was so excited to see it up close, and when we got there, it was like a stove pipe with a tin hat and nothing compared to the craft we had seen. I asked the military man where the craft was that looked like two saucers with the windows in the middle, and that hovered here and hovered there and disappeared in between times, and he looked at me like I was crazy and said, ""Lady, we don't have ANYTHING like THAT!""  Well, I was so upset to think that what I saw might not belong to America, that my friend and I walked four miles home and I was in terror the whole time thinking how I was so wrong and those little seventh graders were so hep and right.

I don't know how large this thing was because we had nothing to compare it to since it was above us and we were on the top of the mountain looking up. The windows were not clear glass, and we saw moving figures, but they were dim and didn't seem large-sized from where we were looking. (Years later, my husband and I heard a woman at my Dad's house in Myrtle Beach, SC, tell how the same type of craft that I saw landed on a freeway where she was driving, and it was enormous in size, and all the people moved to the side of the road and got out of their cars to get a better look. Some teen-ager was behind this woman, and he was so excited, he grabbed her and started jumping up and down and screaming...""I finally saw one!  I finally saw one!""  She was more afraid of him than the UFO.  She said she was always afraid to tell anyone about her experience because she felt people think you're crazy to admit you had such an encounter.)

In June of 1957, I was an eleven year old and playing softball at a local El Paso, Tx southside park.  It gets hot in El Paso, Texas, so we started the game around 9:00a.m.  I had been designated to play shortstop and therefore was facing North towards the local Franklin Mountains (part of the Rocky Mountain chain).

This was a beautiful clear day with no clouds whatsover.  At approxiately 10:00 a.m. as we were out on the field, I  was distracted by a huge flying craft that ""hovered"" momentarily over the southern tip of the Franklin Mountains.  This circular disk was metalic and stopped in mid-air for about 2 or 3 seconds.  The craft had flown in from the Northeast area of El Paso.  After stopping in mid-air, the craft departed from the mid-air stop and disappeared in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds into the Northwest sky of El Paso.

The game was finished around 11:00a.m. and I did not tell any of my playmates about the flying object.  The whole episode seemed so unrealistic!  As I started walking home after the game, I noticed an Army Green Weather Ballon flying from the Northeast part of El Paso.  The Northeast El Paso area houses parts of Fort Bliss (Army base), McGregor Range (missle testing grounds, and further north of these installations, White Sands Proving Grounds (missile testing grounds), and Holloman Air Force Base.  Even as an eleven year old kid, I knew that I had seen a ""flying craft"" that others more mature than myself had also witnessed.

I had never publicly acknowledged this incident, however, 3-4 years ago, I saw a movie called ""Independence Day"".  The huge mother ship in the movie resembled the flying craft in appeareance only.  The size of what I saw  was not that big.  I'm now in my 50's and can still vividly see that UFO I witnessed some 45 years ago.

""F-16s Pursue Unknown Craft Over Region By Steve Vogel Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday, July 27, 2002; Page B02 For Renny Rogers, it was strange enough that military jets were flying low over his home in Waldorf in the middle of the night. It was what he thinks he saw when he headed outside to look early yesterday that floored him.

""It was this object, this light-blue object, traveling at a phenomenal rate of speed,"" Rogers said. ""This Air Force jet was right behind it, chasing it, but the object was just leaving him in the dust. I told my neighbor, 'I think those jets are chasing a UFO.' "" Military officials confirm that two F-16 jets from Andrews Air Force Base were scrambled early yesterday after radar detected an unknown aircraft in area airspace. But they scoff at the idea that the jets were chasing a strange and speedy, blue unidentified flying object.

""We had a track of interest, so we sent up some aircraft,"" said Maj. Douglas Martin, a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado, which has responsibility for defending U.S. airspace. ""Everything was fine in the sky, so they returned home."" At the same time, military officials say they do not know just what the jets were chasing, because whatever it was disappeared. ""There are any number of scenarios, but we don't know what it was,"" said Maj. Barry Venable, another spokesman for NORAD.

Radar detected a low, slow-flying aircraft about 1 a.m. yesterday, according to a military official. Controllers were unable to establish radio communication with the unidentified aircraft, and NORAD was notified. When the F-16s carrying air-to-air missiles were launched from Andrews, the unidentified aircraft's track faded from the radar, the military official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Pilots with the D.C. Air National Guard's 113th Air Wing, which flew the F-16s from Andrews, reported nothing out of the ordinary, NORAD officials said.

""It was a routine launch,"" said Lt. Col. ********, a senior officer with the wing, which keeps pilots and armed jets on 24-hour alert at Andrews to respond to incidents as part of an air defense system protecting Washington after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

This happened approximately 10 years ago, so my details on the exact time and date are a bit sketchy.  It was sometime around 10 pm in the spring/summer time.

A friend and I were driving west on Downs Blvd (he was driving, I was in passenger seat), moving into the Ridgecrest Heights area (which is very dark at night at this time).  Sky was cloudy and had been sprinkling earlier, clouds approximately 3000 to 4000 feet.  There were no aircraft that were discernable in the sky below the clouds.

At the same time, we both suddenly noticed a bright, fireball-like object that appeared to come down from the cloud level and drop below the level of the hills to the SouthWest of town.  It's color was a deep reddish-orange.  It seemed to drop much slower than an object on fire would fall.  The object lit up the clouds and hills below it as it dropped, and once below the hills disappeared.  Due to the distance (approximately 5 miles from where we were driving) I was not completely certain, but it appeared to NOT be trailing smoke at all.

My friend turned to me and asked ""Did you see that?""  I confirmed that I had.  We both discussed it for a few more minutes, initially thinking perhaps it was an aircraft from nearby China Lake Naval Weapons Center that had gone down... but rejected this thought later as there was no flash or explosion or otherwise once the object fell below the hills, nor was there any sound of explosion at all (we would have heard it from the distance we were at I am certain).  The color of the object also bothered me, as the fire on most burning aircraft is much lighter... yellowish orange.  As I worked on the China Lake site for a Government contractor at the time, I assumed that it would be common knowledge of a plane went down from either China Lake or Edwards Air Force Base... however, no one I talked to had heard of the incident, and no aircraft was reported to have gone down at that time.  Not sure what the object was... and had forgotten about it until I found this site.  Initially I dismissed it as some strange anomaly, but after reading more and more of the sightings posted here, I have become fairly convinced that my friend and I witnessed some sort of craft that night.

A quick note on the hills in question - These hills are largely rolling hills West of town and have little real height.  Ridgecrest sits in the bottom of the China Lake valley, so seeing beyond the hills is impossible when in the town itself.  However, due to their small height, any large explosion or other like flash would easily be seen above / behind these hills.

Background info - I am currently a 33 year old male who grew up in Ridgecrest (living now in WA State).  I am a Computer / Network Systems Analyst.  I grew up in Ridgecrest, and was always fascinated by aircraft.  As a result of living near China Lake and Edwards AFB, I was able to determine the silhouete of just about any US aircraft at close and distant ranges.  Working on site at China Lake I also was privy to viewing testing of missiles, bombs,  and other such weapons, which accustomed me to seeing burning aircraft in flight and falling debris from such tests.

Air Force Test Missile Out West
Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET


VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico.

The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara.

""The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly,"" said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara.

The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said.

Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show.

""We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early,"" Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets.

""Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is,"" Gabel said.

The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.

The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability.

I swear I saw this, and I was an Astronomy student, and I have no idea what the hell this was, but here it is.  I was looking out my window to watch the sky darken (it was a little before dusk) and I saw what looked like light resembing what you would see when a plane comes in to land in the fog. Judging by the height (it seems as high as a jetliner would fly while cruising) I saw a light with a fog seeming to trail behind it, but I found it strange that if it were an aircraft with a light on in the upper atmosphere the ""fog"" would be opposite the direction it was moving.  Anyway, as it travelled along, I was waiting for what I thought would be where the light would be pointed directly in my direction, when all of the sudden, it exploded into a faint, white fireball, that resembled what looks like a firework burst.  All white, with symmetric white arms - just like what you'd see on July 4.  Then they fissled out and it was gone.  I have never seen anything like this.  I'm guessing that it was a meteor, but it was moving so slow, and I have seen those before.  There was no ""fire trail"" or sparks, and it was moving as if it were a jetliner.  MAN, I wish I knew.

The light was shinning down at a 45 degreen angle to the ground in a perfect cone shape. The end of the cone did not fade like light would, it cut off perfectly and flat on the bottom. It was a light as if you'd see in fog conditions, except there was no fog and not a single cloud. We stood and watched for about 15 seconds when it suddenly turned into a spider web shape.

The sky was dark outside, with no clouds around at all.  So I was very surprised when I looked outside and saw a bright cloudlike path, much like the trail left behind by a jet with a smoke trail.  This trail was very bright against the night sky, and spirled around and around, and finally amassed into a large body of cloud-like radiance.  This entire trail was so luminated, it almost looked like it was lit from within.  As I followed the path with my eyes up to this large mass, I noticed movement towards the perimeter of this mass, moving upward.  It appeared to be a small craft or object, moving upward.  The direction of the path was from south to north.  I followed this object visually for a few seconds, and then it almost appeared to explode.  I do not know what happened to it after that.  And they sky was left brightened by this cloudlike path for about 20 minutes.  After the craft disappeared, I saw a few aircraft in the area.

It left an extremly long wiggly trail that the lit up the sky for over a half an hour. The trail was greyish and parts of it was orange , red blue, and then purple.

We thought this was a misle from the base, but they don't dance around they get down to business.

Oh, and there was no noise, but it sure was a traffic stopper.

Thanks for listening.

Air Force Test Missile Out West
Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET


VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico.

The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara.

""The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly,"" said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara.

The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said.

Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show.

""We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early,"" Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets.

""Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is,"" Gabel said.

The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.

The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability.

it looked like a comet streaking through the sky.  cool.

It was sunset around 1930 on Lake Tahoe Ca.  My Roommate and I were on our deck looking outto the SSW.  Seemingly from nowhere a bright spherical light came out of the southern mountains.  If you know Lake Tahoe, we are on the north shore on the california side in TAhoe City, from our angle it looked like it was over Emerald Bay but a way higher altitude and more to the west.

It started as a tighter looking vapor trail comming from a bright white sphere.  Over the next 2-3 minute the vapor became thicker wider.  After about 4 minutes from the initial sighting teh sphere gave off a big puff.  A ring like vapor cloud floated for about the next 3 minutes where it the ""puff"" occured.  From that point on the leading edge of hte sphere was the brightest and the vapors no longer came off only as a tight vapor tail but also as wispy trails arching like a parabola from it.  After about 7 minutes from inital sighting  it disappeared  but the vapor trail still glowed in the sun setting over the western mountains.

My wife just came home and traffic in Kings Beach lake tahoe california stopped and many other people observed it.

I believe it was a comet that streaked through the upper atmosphere and vaporized.

While driving west on State Highway 180 two miles from downtown Flagstaff I noticed a bright solid light 5 degrees above the horizon. I mistook it for the planet Venus. It seemed that the light was shining through clouds or fog. The brilliant light faded but a cone of light remained looking exactly like the sky does when the full Moon is about to rise. In fact, for a moment I thought the cone of light which radiated about 10 degrees above the horizon was the full Moon. Naturally the near full Moon was rising directly behind me in the East about 10 degrees above the eastern horizon. Also about 15 degrees due south on the horizon the planet Venus shown like a beacon. The light I saw and the resulting cone or mountain shaped light was not the Moon or Venus. I wonder if it was a rocket launch or something... the light remained in the western sky for 10 minutes before I left the scene where I had parked my car to observe this highly unusual light. The weather conditions were thus: No clouds, crystal clear skies and certainly no fog.

Peter, any idea?

I am submitting this for a friend who is repeating the following to me during a phone conversation, but who has no web access right now.

Walking at top of Topanga Canyon overlooking Pacific Ocean.  In sky over ocean a huge, spherical, object pushed through the clouds.  It appeared about 100 times larger than a blimp and was primarily bright white.  It emerged from the north, sat high above the horizon, then moved south.  It had a stream of orange flame, as if from a engine.  It also had contrails in all directions as if exploding, almost.  This went on for about 10 minutes, then the white area became triangular and the contrails formed a Z, and then slowly formed other shapes as white shape faded to greenish blue.  All the dogs in the area were howling (except mine, which isn't saying anything as he's slightly retarded).

At first I thought this was the moon, but the moon was already appearing in the southern sky.  Then I thought it was a refraction of setting sunlight reflecting off the ocean and through the clouds, but it appeared extremely three dimensional and extremely bright.  If it was refraction, I've never anything quite like it.

I've never reported UFO sightings before.  I have never seen one and was frightened and alarmed and turned on the tv to see if we were in trouble.  I am a professional journalist, respectably published, sober, and generally a skeptic.  Would like to find out if anyone else saw this thing.

Air Force Test Missile Out West
Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET


VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico.

The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara.

""The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly,"" said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara.

The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said.

Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show.

""We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early,"" Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets.

""Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is,"" Gabel said.

The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.

The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability.

A good friend, at the time assigned as  NORAD Watch Cmdr, 11pm-0700 shift, rank: CPT, USAF was on duty at Malmstrom AFB in Great Falls, Montana when an incident occurred quite similar to that reported in the 1975 newspaper article you have posted on your website. My friend was made aware that sensors surrounding one missile silo recorded a rapid rise in ground temperature( from -25 to -30F to 50 or 60F} within the space of 5-15 minutes. Simultaneously all the sensors on perimeter ""fences"" showed that whatever was occurring had not been initiated by something crossing the fences nor had any of the ground sensors indicated anything had ""walked"" by ground passage up to the missile site. He said he was told that the missile silo cover had been set aside, that ""crew"" from the unknown craft broke into the missile silo, and some of its ""crew""  were examining the circuitry of the ballistic missile. At least one Observer on the U.S. military reaction team arrived to see ""crew"" scampering aboard the ""craft"". Apparently as is SOP, fighters  scrambled. My friend said when the radar target appeared on ""his"" radar scopes within a few moments of the reaction team's ""radioed"" report, it was travelling straight up at a speed in excess of 50,000 miles an hour. It disappeared by moving outside the range of the radar his NORAD shift was using.

When he told me this he began perspiring profusely and was very nervous and discomfitted. As a decorated Vietnam combat veteran I know nervousness and a few things about fear. My friend was very nervous, a bit scared, and upset. If we had not been such good friends he probably would not have told me about this. He did know about one prior UFO experience I had - and before this happened used to give me grief about what I had told him had happened to me. Ever since that conversation I am now reporting, he has never made fun of UFO sightings or reports.

When I read the report situated on your website I initially thought you were talking about what my friend had reported to me. I was very surprised that the date was 1975 because, if what my friend told me was true - and I believe what he said, it wasn't the first time missiles at Malmstrom AFB had been examined by unknown personnel from a craft whose origins were also unknown. From what my friend said, it had technology far ahead of ours. He said everyone was told the ""incident did't happen."" I'm afraid I can't be more specific because I am relating the comments my friend made. That is why I can't give you a shape of the craft or other details. He was watching this on various instrumentations, but others involved ""talked"" to eachother, swapping info {I would imagine} to confirm they weren't crazy. He was an experienced Fighter controller expert, so this was no novice relating the story to me.

1972 or 1973: Missile Silo opening & missile examination, Malmstrom AFB, Great Falls, Montana

On friday, 20 Sep 02,I reported a friend's sighting at Malmstrom AFB in 1972-73 when he was a NORAD watch Commander during the night shift {11pm to 0700am} with reference to the article you had posted of a 1975 event at that AFB. According to my friend, the 1972 or 1972 event was similar to the one in 1975 in that the missile silo was opened, then the missile was opened up and the electronic circuitry examined. See my friday report. One thing I forgot: this ""craft"" apparently lit up the area surrounding the missile silo so its""crew"" had light to work by.

This event occurred somtime in September of 1988, I don't recall the exact date at this time. I was working as a school district police officer and was sitting in the middle of one of the high school campuses, writing on my patrol log. I had the window of my truck down and was using the illumination from a security light on one of the nearby buildings to write by. The sky was clear, stars visible, no moonlight that I recall. Suddenly, the interior of my truck lit up like it was daylight. My first impression was that a truck with off-road lights had pulled up behind me and suddenly turned on all its' lights at once. This startled me quite a bit, as I did not hear anything, even with the window down. I looked up from my writing and into the rear view mirror, only to discover there was nothing there. I considered the possiblity of a police helicopter shining its' spotlight on me, but there was no helicopter noise. Also, the spotlight from a helicopter has a blue-ish tinge to it, and has an oscillating effect due to the vibrations from the rotors. There was no sense that the light source was moving, and it was white light, like daylight. I looked out the window into the sky to try and locate the source. As I looked around, I saw an irregular patch of white light in the sky to the northeast, about 40 degrees above the horizon. The shape was roughly elliptical, but had ragged edges. The patch of light seemed to be closing in on itself, and it disappeared as I watched it. The size of the patch when I first saw it was about 4 or 5 times larger that the full moon, but much brighter. I checked the newspapers for the next several weeks to see if there was any mention of meteors or other events which would explain what I saw, but nothing ever appeared.

I grew up near several airports and a military aircraft factory, and am familiar with conventional aircraft. While I am not an amateur astronomer, I like to look at the sky for relaxation, and have seen various types of meteors and bolides. I have seen countless missile launches from Vandenberg AFB, and have been watching satellites since Echo 1. I have never seen anything like this before or since.","law enforcement",1,1,"flash",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1988,1980,3,9,3,"Night","West",0,1,0,0,0

Last Wednesday, the 18th of September, my sister came to my apartment around 8:45 or so in the evening.  I live on a fairly high floor of an apartment building, facing the city of Harrisburg.  I was eating dinner and looking out my bedroom window, while also talking to my sister.  A bright yellow (almost planet-looking) light appeared in front of my eyes as I glanced out the window, and then just as suddenly, disappeared.

I was curious as to what happened, and told my sister to check out the sky.  We both stepped closer to the window, and on the horizon, we both saw the same type of light appear a few inches away from the one I saw initially.  There were three other lights that did essentially the same thing (blink in, stay in plain sight for approx. 5-10 sec., and then dissappear).  About 15 min or so into seeing the yellow lights, a red light appeared to the lower right of the yellow ones.  It then proceeded to split into a triangle of three identical red lights, and then all simultaneously disappear.  The red formation occurred a few times.  During the second red light formation, i called a friend who lives about two miles further down Front St. in Harrisburg, and has access to the second floor.  He was able to see a red light, from his vandtage point, at the same time I was seeing it.  While the red and yellow lights were blinking in and out, there was a white light, that streaked from right to diagonal lower left (approx. 2 inches in length).  The streak occurred in a split sec. and was the only one we witnessed.  While all of these fairly steady, planet-looking lights were appearing, and then disappearing (not streaking, or fading, or even twinkling), there were much smaller (star-like) lights which were zig-zagging across the entire visible expanse of sky.  Initially, they looked like very distant airplanes, until they started erratically bouncing up and down, back and forth, and any which way.  My sister witness these ""bouncing stars"" as well.

I have a steady job, friends, and family, all of whom will concede that i'm pretty down to earth.  (i've kept two cats alive for at least a few years).  I do have a fairly liberal view of the world in general, and tend to accept a lot, but not without some proof.  I can hardly believe what I saw, but I've witnessed almost as strange instances in the past.  The friend who I called on the evening of the 18th was the one who checked out this web site, and I felt compelled to send in this info. since other sightings in PA had been reported.  There was apparently a news report this past Sunday (the 22nd) stating that some sort of Airforce testing (flares in the sky so they could test heat-sensitive missiles) was occurring this month.  Whatever.  I 've seen flares in the sky.  They linger, and fade.  These lights DISAPPEARED!!!  I've also seen airplanes turn course in the night sky (they don't just disappear).  Whatever these lights were, I've never seen exactly what i saw on the night of the 18th.  I hope there are those out there who will take credence in (at least) three witnesses of a single event over a bull story from our fabulous government.

Slow flying very bright ball of light, surrounded by a much larger halo of light, trailed by miles of zig-zaging smoke.

On September 19th, 2002 I drove through Yosemite Park, California from west to east. It was about 7:45 pm and it was dark already. I noticed something very bright in the sky, and I thought it was a full moon. When I looked up I noticed a strange looking very bright ball of light, surrounded by a much larger ball of light, followed by a zig-zagging trail that was several miles long.

I live 5 minutes away from JFK airport in New York, and I have seen planes take off, fly, and land in all kinds of weather and lighting conditions, and I have watched many TV documentaries about missiles, the space shuttle, etc. but I have never seen anything like the ""UFO"" over Yosemite Park. The object slowly flew from west to east, from the Pacific towards Nevada and seemed to be in a slow ascend.

I slammed on the brakes and stopped my car in the middle of the road, grabbed my camera and began to video-tape the object. After a few seconds I stopped the video-camera and tried to take a photo with my digital camera. Unfortunately the flash was on, so the picture came out pitch black. While I tried to figure out how to shut off the flash, the light in the sky slowly disappeared. The bright ball and the huge halo slowly dimmed away. Only the long zig-zagging trail remained.

I video-taped for a little while longer and tried several more times to take a photo, to no avail. I continued to drive east towards Nevada. About 30 minutes later I noticed red and white blinking lights from 2 or 3 aircrafts that came from the east (I assume from the nearby Nellis Airforce Base in Nevada aka Area 51.) and continued to circle above the area.","Cartoonist",1,1,"light",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Probable report of missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.

As I approached my home, a man and his two children were standing at the corner, and I stopped.  He said he thought it was a missile test.  I've never seen anything like it in my life.

I was looking south, at the rising moon and noticed what looked like a very high altitude aircraft proceeding northwest.

As it travelled across the sky, it was leaving a brightly lit trail like a contrail behind a jet. The object was bullet shaped, like the fuselage of an airplane. It seemed to be very high in the sky, like when you see jets way up there. It appeared very bright against the darkening sky of dusk, as if it was the source of the light, not just reflecting the setting sun.

The trail it left was lit up too...it was different from a regular contrail in that it was much wider.

After watching for about 15 seconds, it emitted a huge burst of this trail.  It kept going for another 45 seconds or so, then suddenly burst into a huge explosion, like fireworks display. It seemed to just disintegrate.  The trail it left was visible for several minutes after, appearing to be blown into a curved shape by winds.

Event occurred mid-afternoon on a bright, clear summer day over the city of Victoria, B.C., Canada.  I was in a backyard, in the city, looked up and noticed, flying directly overhead, apparently very high up, an object.  It flew right over the city.  It was roughly football-shaped.  Both ends were the same, and more rounded than a football.

Its shape was approximately a marriage between a football and a watermelon.  Oblong.  It looked sort of like a pod.  Very symetrical.

It had smooth, distinct, well-defined boundaries.  Definitely an object - a craft - and obviously artificial.  And it definitely had no wings.

Its surface appearance was a light...dull...silvery...metallic.  But...  I dunno.  The surface seemed to my eyes somehow...a bit odd.  Not blurry.

It was quite clear and distinct.  And yet...I couldn't seem to see the surface of it clearly.  So it confused me some.  I wondered: what was I seeing? The object was flying too high to make out any surface detail.  It appeared to be featureless.  I saw absolutely no evidence of any wings, nor windows, nor anything that would have allowed me to know that it was some sort of aircraft.

It was utterly unlike any aircraft I had ever seen, or ever have seen.  And it was *really* moving.  In fact, it startled me, how fast it appeared to be flying.

I said, to two other people who were with me, ""What is that?""  I pointed up at it.  They both looked up, and they both also saw the object.

One of my friends suggested that it was a ""cruise missile"".  (Like he could immediately see for himself that it was not an airplane or a jet.) (Some cruise missile testing has been conducted in Canada, but I doubt that any such tests have occurred over Vancouver Island.) I said no, cruise missiles are long, like cigars.  That is definitely *not* a cruise missile.  It looked to be totally the wrong shape, and far too large to be a missile, and it was also flying way too high, and travelling too fast.  Usually cruise missiles travel close to the ground.  The object I saw was at very high altitude.

Several things about that object have left a lasting impression.

(1) It appeared to be flying very high.  I would estimate that its altitude was likely several kilometers.

(2) It appeared to be *big*.  I guessed that it was probably approximately the size of a small house.  I got the impression from observing it that its body was much larger than the body of any aircraft I'd ever seen.  I've been around Hercules transport, and even flown on one.

They are quite large aircraft.  So I konw their size.  The body on this thing looked to be a lot fatter than a Herc's.  This is guessing, as you can understand, because I was seeing this thing from a considerable distance.  But right above me, on a clear day.  Its size would naturally depend on its distance.  But what my brain was telling me was: it was big, and very high up.

(3) It was also really moving.  I guessed that it was probably travelling at approximately Mach 2.  It was in sight for only about 15 seconds.

In that time it travelled all the way overhead.  It was just racing across the sky, at several degrees of angular travel, per second.

It was definitely *not* a meteorite.  No glow, and it looked definitely *constructed*.  I could see it very clearly.

I saw first it when it was almost directly overhead.  I was just stretching or something, looked up, and bingo.  I'd say it was moving at about 5 degrees of arc per second.  Fast.

If the object I saw was at high altitude - several kilometers up - and it did appear to be, very high up, that means that it was going pretty fast.

Probably supersonic.

(4) It was totally silent.  That struck as me as strange.  I was listening intently for some engine sound, or possibly even a sonic boom.

Because I thought it was probably flying faster than the speed of sound.  So I naturally expected to hear something, maybe even a boom.

But I heard: *nothing*.  Just silence.  It didn't make a sound.  I heard from it not even the faintest whisper of an engine.  Just silence.

So I thought: whoa.  That is pretty weird.  Why can't I hear that thing? And I was really pondering then.  There's this...high performance craft of some sort, flying high up, probably at close to Mach 2, yet it is *silent*.

And I wondered, how can any aircraft move that fast, apparently supersonically, yet make *no* sound? I kept listening.  I heard no engine sound; no boom, no anything.  It just seemed so strange.

But it also *looked* weird.  Like a football.  Something with no wings.  Flying.

(5) And no contrail.  No hint of any conventional engine.  It was flying along like it was propelled by magic.

For those several reasons - its apparent size (big), its shape (weird, round, no wings), it's apparent altitude (very high up), its apparent velocity (fast), but especially its acoustic stealth...it all kind of spooked me.  I thought: wow, whatever that is, it's *really* different.  If it's some sort of experimental aircraft, some new kind of jet, that a human pilot is flying, then it must have a pretty wickedly *different* engine in it.  Powerful, for one thing.

Because it seemed to be really travelling overhead, and effortlessly.  I'd gues that even the most advanced scram(?) engines that are capable of pushing an aircraft that fast, or faster (even to Mach 5), must make a lot of *noise*, yes? I kept wondering, as I stared at it, what kind of airplane looks like a football, has no wings and is *silent*?  I just kept staring up at it in awe.

Now, bear in mind, I am a skeptic.  I think a lot of the reports are due to either intoxication or imagination or are just bull.  But my report is sincere.

I have attended university and I have worked in a scientific field.  (Earth physics.)  I have studied science.  (Physics.)  I'm a very logical person.  I do not believe easily.  I always want *evidence* before I believe something.  But on that sunny summer day...I figure that I got some evidence, with my own eyes.  Enough.  I saw something really strange in the sky.  Enough to warrant a report, I think.

To this day I have a lot of difficulty believing that what I saw that summer day, about 12 years ago, flying high overhead, was designed and built by humans.  Because every time I've seen an aircraft flying overhead - even if it's flying at 35,000 feet - I can always *hear* something.

Always.  I used to listen to jets flying over the North Pole, way up.  Intercontinental jets on their way from South Korea to Europe, or the other way, over the pole.  (We were on their flight path.  I was posted at a weather station up there for a while.)  And I could always hear the jets flying over, no matter how high they were.  Even when one was just a tiny dot in the sky.  Even then.  Always.  And I could always see wings on it.  Moreover, I could always see their contrails.  Hot gases condense, cool, and form clouds behind the jets, when they're high up.  Hot gas plus cold air leave a trail.  But this thing left no trail.  Apparently very high up, in the atmosphere, yet no sound from it, and no trail.  No wings.  An absolutely quiet football, passing quickly right overhead.  It was rather spooky, in fact.

And perhaps more importantly, the many jets I've seen fly overheard - at approximately, apparently, the same altitude - were not moving nearly as fast as the thing I saw that day appeared to be moving.  Jets travelling at around 35,000 feet and at roughly 3/4 the speed of sound move across the sky rather slowly.  They just kind of creep along.  They move at maybe one degree or so of arc per second.  Ballpark.

So it takes them about a full minute from the time you can first see them until they are out of sight.  So call that 180 degrees, from horizon to horizon.  Divide that by 60 seconds, that is roughly 3 degrees of arc per second, give or take.

The object I saw that day covered about 90 degrees in only about 15 seconds.  That's roughly 6 degrees per second, or twice as fast.

If it was indeed flying at the very high altitude that I thought it was flying, that means that it was travelling at something like 1200 or 1400 miles per hour, or almost Mach 2.  Almost certainly faster than the speed of sound.  Should be a shock wave from that.  So logic told me, that thing should create a sonic *boom*.  I knew it had a powerful engine, pushing it - it had to be, to go that fast - so I should hear some sort of sonic bang.  And if was flying at a *lower* altitude than I thought it is, then it should definitely be able to hear its engine.

But what did I hear?  I heard nothing.  I heard absolutely *nothing* from it.  Not a blessed sound.

So I was getting kind of weirded out about this, you know.  I was trying to make all the pieces fit, logically, in my mind, and they just wouldn't fit.

I had no way to objectively know that object's true size or altitude or speed.  And I realize that they all factor together.  If I was wrong about its altitude, then I'd be wrong about its speed, and also about its size.  But I saw it very distinctly, quite clearly, for a good many seconds, and I was studying it.  I think my gut instincts are pretty good.  My hearing is pretty good, too.  I did not hear a whisper from that thing.

Not a whisper.  Just silence.

Then after it was gone, I began to reason it out.  (Or tried to.)  OK.  I just saw something that had no wings.  Definitely no wirngs.  Yet...it was flying.

OK.  That's pretty weird but...a high performance jet that has no wings....  Hey, they make them every day.  In fact, there are some craft we've built that have hardly any wings.  (For example, the space shuttle has hardly any wings.)  This thing that I saw - I am sure - had no wings at all.

None.  A flying football.  But also....  No engine sound.  Ergo, no engine, either.  And to me, that's altogether another matter.  No wings is one thing.

No engine is...whoa.  Over the line.

And that is why, despite my healthy skepticism, I have some *doubt* that humans built the thing with no wings that I saw that day, high up in the sky, and moving very fast.  It bothers me.  I still can't make all the pieces.  Unless we didn't build it.  Then...everything fits.

Years later I read and heard about an object that apparently flew right *under* (and close to) a British passenger airliner, as it was crossing the Atlantic Ocean.  At some considerable risk to his career, that pilot bravely (and officially) reported a UFO that I believe was of similar size and shape, to my object.  I believe he reported something that was shaped approximately like a watermelon, or a football, i.e. round? And *big*.  Bigger than his airliner.  And he said it was also travelling a lot faster.  He estimated it was moving at least twice as fast as him.

It just whizzed by him.  Now that would mean that it was moving faster than the speed of sound.  He was going maybe 500 or 600 mph, so it was going roughly 1,000 or 1,200 mph.  Maybe even 1400 mph.  He said it passed right under him! So he expected to feel some turbulence from it, but in their statements, he and his co-pilot both said that they felt *nothing*.  Not even a bump.

They also reported that they heard *nothing*.  That the object that passed by them was silent.

Now, I believe that pilot indeed saw what he claimed that he saw.  After what I saw, I believe him.  And it's occurred to me that that sighting (a fairly respectable sighting) - by two professional airline pilots (who had a lot to lose by reporting what they saw) - matches up reasonably well with what I saw with my own eyes, from a distance of several kilometers, about 12 years ago.

In both cases, it was something *big*.  It was round, and fast, and silent.  I think *I* have seen that one, too.  Maybe I saw the same craft, or type of craft, as they saw.  There is bound to be some overlap in the appearance reported, if they are real.  If at least one is real.

Whatever it is, I know - for pretty sure - that it's something approximately as big as a house, and it can move very fast - definitely supersonically - and yet it evidently does not disturb the atmosphere around it, and therefore it makes no sound.  Somehow, it just slices through the air without creating any turbulence or wake or chaotic vortex behind it.  It can move faster than sound, without creating a sonic boom.  Its propulsion system Is, I can verify, dead silent.  Now...you tell me, please, what sort of aircraft we (humans) have built that could possibly fit that description.

Because I'm not aware of any.  And I suspect that not even the U.S. military are aware of any.  Unless they do know, about those things, and they're keeping their mouths shut.  Maybe to keep our sensitive brains from overloading.  :) I suspect that it will be a very long time before *we* know how to build something like what I saw.  Whatever it was, it just kissed the sky, a nice silent kiss.  I would call it the ultimate in graceful flying machine.  Thinking back now, on what I observed, during those few seconds...

I'd have to say that it was not only impressive, but beautiful.  Somehow...elegant.  Such a remarkable craft!  To fly without any wings!  Wow! If you ever saw it, I know it would be enough to make your jaw drop, when you witnessed it for yourself, zipping along, lickety-split, and passing quickly overhead, silently, like God throwing a silver football.  You don't hear a thing.  That's pretty neat.

I suppose the whole subject of UFOs alarms some people.  But if I may speak to the issue of fear.  Personally I regard it as unwarranted.  Or at the very least, as unhelpful.  It can only cloud our thinking on the issue.  Of whether or not some extraterrestrial intelligence does indeed exist in the proximity of the Earth.  I don't know if it does.  It may.

They don't scare me.  I never felt scared, or alarmed.  Instead, I felt...awe.  I remember feeling just very impressed.  And I still feel that way, all these years later.  As the amusing Pat Paulsen once said, there is nothing to fear, except fear itself.  And of course, the bogeyman!  :) I figure that if ""they"" are up there, cruising around, as though our atmosphere is their playground and race track, they are probably not bugs, or critters, like us.  They are probably not green, or grey.  They are probably not even alive, in the same sense that we use that term.

My own personal speculation (if I may be allowed that here) is that the pilot onboard that quite incredible craft I saw (if not human, and if that craft was not of human design) was probably the equivalent of a very advanced robot.  Maybe I saw a probe.  Something...probably self-repairing, highly intelligent, and autonomous.

Perhaps - I merely speculate here, because I *doubt* that we made the thing I saw - the pilot and the craft were one and the same.  Maybe I saw one of the same sorts of things that weve sent out, to explore other planets.  Unmanned.  Yet still capable of doing a lot.  But a *lot* more sophisticated, and a lot more capable.  Maybe - just maybe - *one* of their probes, centuries or even thousands or perhaps even millions of years ago, found a planet with bugs on it.  So it set about building more probes, using materials it found here, and now they are *all* busy studying us.  :) I don't know.  I'm just throwing that out as the most ""reasonable"" explanation, as I see it, if there *is* (indeed) something of an extraterrestrial nature in or around our atmosphere, and present there fairly often.  There certainly do seem to be a lot of sightings, including a large percentage that some from very reasonable and responsible people, who have no interest in hoaxing anyone.

If you don't believe me, fine.  But I *know* what I saw.

As I see, ""machine"" intelligence (only) would get around the long flight time problem.  Let's suppose that matter indeed *cannot* travel faster than light, so even their fastest spacecraft travel at ""less than"".  A robot probably wouldn't care how many centuries it took to reach another star.

Even if it took 10,000 years for it to get from there to here, so what?  A well-designed, very advanced, sophisticated, intelligent, self-repairing probe could still be in perfect working order after many centuries, or even thousands of years.  In fact, in theory, even a million years could pass, and it could still be fully functional.  That would violate none of the laws of physics.

I'm not a UFO nut, at all.  I actually have not a great amount of interest in it, because I think hard evidence will be very difficult to come by.

Basically if they're up there, I figure they're too smart and too fast for us.  So doubtful we'll ever be able to capture one, or even real close to one.

But from all that I've read, and seen, of video clips of sightings - and there are now quite a number (including at least one video of things flitting around in space near rocket launches, caught on film)....

I'd humbly suggest to everyone that the behavior of those apparently ET vehicles that many have seen (maybe myself included) is probably best described (and understood) as the behavior of quite logical and advanced *machines*, rather than the behavior of living creatures.

They do not seem to much care what we think, do they?  To my mind, that says: machines.  Smart, analytical, but otherwise mostly devoid of sentiment.

In any event, if they *are* here (and I am not suggesting they are, because I don't know what I saw), they may ""just"" be doing science.  Studying.

Collecting data.  Curiosity is a trait we should easily understand.  We - as a species - are very curious ourselves.  We are already exploring other planets, too.  I'm sure that if those craft are real, and alien in origin, and are piloted by ""machines"" (as I suggest), then those machine are still many times smarter than humans.

That is a logical assumption too, I think, because suppose they started exploring space ""just"" 100,000 years ago.  In less than a hundred years, from now - and maybe in only a few decades - *we* will have machines that are much smarter than us.  So...truly advanced (artificial) minds on those craft is not that hard to imagine.  If you work it out, using carbon nanotubes and molecule-scale processors, one cubic centimeter of their processor cores could have approximately the processiong power of about a billion Pentium IVs processors.  So an alien processor even a meter cubed would dwarf all of our computers, and maybe all of our minds as well.

Put in those terms, one of those ships wouldn't have much to worry about, in terms of being outsmarted, or outclassed.

As I see it, there is no inherent reason why even very advanced, intelligent probes should want or seek any direct or intentional contact with us.

That doesn't fit within the agenda of ""study"".  Especially if we seem to them to be very primitive.  And I wouldn't argue with them on that point.

We're still all pretty...duh.  :) But even *if* that object I saw flying high overhead about 12 years ago was built in a plant somewhere right here on earth, by humans who get a paycheck for building neat stuff - I would say to the guys who built it (if I could): boys, congratuations!  Your new airship is technology with a capital T.

I mean...first of all, it looks *alien*.  It looks like...puh, Hollywood, move over.  And on top of looking weird and ET-ish, you've managed to build something that's evidently about the size of a cottage, that has no wings, and it can zip through the earth's atmosphere at quite high altitudes, faster than a rifle bullet, and do it without making a sound.  That's a pretty neat trick.  Where did you get the design for it?  :)

It was chevron shaped, with two tails and a snowball shaped head.  My grandson, who lives 7 miles S of my location, called and said he saw it, but saw a red glow that I could not see from my location.

I checked the Vandenberg AFB Launch Schedule website which indicated a launch was planned for this evening at 19:00.  I called the Redmond Airport, but they were closed.

Please don't contact me - probably not a UFO as I don't believe in them, and did not see a craft - but a weird occurence nonetheless.  Saw a very powerful, wide, white light 40 minutes past sunset that must have been playing some unusual tricks with the clouds.  It was dark, and very cloudy (marine layer).   The light was bright as a star, but about 5-10 times bigger to my eye - a bit bigger than a golf ball, but much smaller than the moon. There was an odd shaping of lit clouds or some sort of light trail forming fast off both sides, starting narrow at the ball, and getting wider as it went out, but changing shape rapidly.   I pulled my car over, saw what looked to be what I call a ""God"" effect, with light piercing through a tunnel hole in the clouds, creating sort of a corona on the sides.  I thought it might be the sun going through an unusual hole in the clouds, but it happened at 7:00, well after sunset.  The cloud trails reminded me of missile testing i've seen before, but the sky was too cloudy.  I never thought helicopter because I didn't hear anything - so it's a mystery.  I then continued to see bright light lighting above the clouds in one patch until I got to my house three minutes later.  Then it faded.  I kept checking every 5 minutes or so, but did not see anythiong.  Then, 20 minutes later, I went back outside with my son, who asked what the blue light was above the clouds, which were turning the otherwise gray   marine clouds blue in a small area, which was the same direction I was observing the earlier white light.   (to the West - over the ocean ?)  I told him I didn't know, but 5 minutes later it faded for good.    End of story - do not return e-mail or contact me please.

While aboard an American Eagle flight from Fort Worth TX to Ft Smith AR over NE Texas on the afternoon of 5 Oct 2002 I observed a airborn red cylinder.  The view was most sharp and clear, and the cylinder was probably more than 10,000 feet up, and perhaps several thousand feet below our plane (maybe much closer, depending on actual size).  The visibility was clear and sunny - I could see the farm squares below.  The object was a deep but bright orange-red.  It didn't seem to have a real cone of a nose, but more blunted.  There were no wings and nothing being exuded out the rear.  I pictured something like an old fashioned cylindrical 500 gallon water tank but twice or three times as long and painted red.  The paint didn't even give a feeling of sophisticated, just heavily enameled. I thought of a large military missile, but could not conceive of how it would be propelled in the air.  Because of the plane motion the object almost appeared to be still, but the ground scenery way below changed at a different rate as the ground relative to our wings.  I saw it for perhaps 30 to 45 seconds - when you are observing something that doesn't belong, time can be a difficult thing to judge ... I did not look at my watch, though I specifically examined its relationship with the plane and the ground.  I looked back and forth from the ground out from front of plane to back, I looked at the other people in the plane, and noone was paying any attention, then I went back to observing the object.  The scenery below was farm rectangles, with rare farmhouses and barns, which were tiny compared to the relatively near cylinder.  It struck me as odd that since I was in the air, not my normal world (I am a land lover), then perhaps it was wrong of me to make any assumptions about what was right or wrong about the appearance of this object in the air below the plane.  The noise of the turbo prop was so loud that it was impossible to talk to anyone else, and by the time we landed around 4PM in Fort Smith I was totally absorbed w! ith the new terminal which had just opened that week.","Computer Scientist",1,1,"cylinder",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2002,2000,4,10,15,"Afternoon","South",0,1,0,0,0

A co-worker and I were outside the building we work taking lunch. We work on the State Campus which is located southeast of the Albany International Airport but within aircraft takeoff and landing patterns.  We were checking out the sky, discussing how unusual it looked with the different kinds of clouds.  Suddenly from the west we notice something bulleting across the sky.  It had a very narrow vapor trail which was so thin that I briefly thought if the puffy clouds were cotton balls it would pull them together like thread. It was also strange in the fact that the trail failed to scallop like the vapor trails of the jets we saw only moments before. The object made no noise.

As it shot more to the northeast it was going to be blocked by the corner of my building.  I went down the steps just in time to catch a glimpse of the object.  It appeared to be football in shape only a bit longer and slightly deflated, with at least one fin on the top and bottom.  Its color looked dark metallic gray.  The air around it was a bit funny; gave the appearance it was traveling in a fuzzy bubble.

Since the military has been active in our area since 9/11, I thought maybe it was something new they were flying so I didn't report the sighting.  I missed the orginal FOX report but my co-worker told me about it the next day.  When I didn't see any followup a week later I wrote FOX email info line to make an inquiry and report that we had seen the object.  To date, I haven't heard anything from them.

While I work in a civilian capacity now, my background is law enforcement.  I was a police/peace officer/investigator for 25 years prior to my current appointment.



((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))

Dear Mr. Davenport:

Thank you for your quick response.  While my report stays the same in every other detail, I failed to check a calender when submiting the date of our sighting and it wasn't the 20th.  My co-worker and I work Monday-Friday.  Ours took place during  the week, the day of the evening report of the Oct 20 object by FOX to the public.   

I do know that for sure as my co-worker came in the next day all excited because he had heard the report of the original object on the news the night before.  He said that FOX had done a report on the object we saw (last time I listen to him).  I didn't see the broadcast and couldn't  find anything on it until I found your site yesterday (I was using the wrong search word on FOX).  I apologize for this inaccuracy. However, it does not change the facts that I have otherwise reported.

You asked if the object made any maneuvers while we watched it.  No.  It was the vapor trail that first drew our attention to the object shooting like a bullet across the sky.  It wasn't until I ran down the steps and the object changed directions (from traveling due east to NE) that I was finally able to briefly get the shape.  

Since we couldn't really see it before and I now could, I had the impression  that it tipped a little and  I was looking more towards the top of the object rather than the side.  It was just so fast I only got a glimpse.  The whole experience was almost surreal in that something that big should have made some sort of a sound but didn't.  Yet the vapor trail and its funny, fuzzy bubble around it told me it was really high up and something ""different"".

I have been thinking about its vapor trail and the way jet vapor trails look.  This object appeared to be more seering the atmosphere than putting out exhaust..

You ask if what I saw was like what the reporter filmed.  His object appears to look more like a walking stick.  Ours was a bit fatter and the fins a bit broader.  It looked as though the reporter's object devoured half of itself, just that much fatter.

Ever since 9/11 when the hijacked plane turned right over us we have been sky watchers.  I have a window seat at work and  can tell when something is going on at the airport, note the flight pattern changes and every type of plane that takes off and lands, including the military.  ((Sentence deleted.)).  This was something I had never seen before.

If I am following your instructions correctly on the degrees, it would be about 200 (coming from the W to NE).  

I appreciate your taking the personal info out of my narrative, as I know my ((deleted)) and my supervisor would not appreciate the FBI coming to see me.  I work for ((deleted)) and we always have enough of things happening in the building without my causing a commotion over something like this.  My ((deleted)) would ((deleted)) me...

Again, please forgive me for not doing a more thorough job in determing the accurate  date.  I am usually better than that..

I was headed north on I-5, and had just passed the North Wilsonville exit.  I was travelling at approx. 70 mph.  Just past the exit, the highway inclines for a ways, then flattens, and then descends down into a valley.  The Tualatin exit is at the bottom of the valley.  As I began to level out after the incline, I noticed a greenish glowing object streaking across the sky.  The object was also headed north, but was travelling faster than me, and appeared to be on a downward path.  I don't know how high up in the sky it was...maybe 200-300 feet?  I don't really have any reference point to provide a good estimate.  It was fairly large, however, and for a moment (because of the whole terrorist scares around the world) wondered if this were a missile about to hit.  It was somewhat spherical, or ovular, almost reminiscent of a comet, but I didn't think to pay very close attention to the shape.  The object's speed was constant, and it descended down into the valley (mentioned above).  I fully expected to see/hear an explosion of some sort, as it was descending very quickly, but nothing happened.

Unidentified object spotted over Grifton By Jana Clancey, The Daily Reflector:  

 Unidentified object spotted over Grifton
By Jana Clancey, The Daily Reflector
Creatures from outer space may have been checking on the affairs of Pitt County residents Friday night. 

Several people from Farmville to the southern tip of Pitt County reported an odd light racing across the night sky. 

J.K. Butler, a former Grifton volunteer firefighter, was sitting in the old Red and White parking lot about 11 p.m. Friday. He was there with three fire department friends when the sky around them lighted up, coloring everything from the ground to the trees to themselves a strange shade of green and blue. 

The light passed over them, he said. And when they looked up, it was so blinding they couldn't identify the object. 

""We all just looked at each other like, 'What in the world was that?'"" Butler said. ""I've seen meteors and space junk and satellites. I ain't never seen anything that color. 

""It had some good size to it, too, and it was up in the air pretty good,"" he said. 

His first thought: the light had come from a UFO. His second: another country was firing missiles in the direction of Pitt County. 

""Maybe it was government-related. If it was, we'll never know,"" he said. 

Over the fire-rescue scanners mounted in the volunteers' trucks, calls came in from Ayden and the Pitt County Sheriff's Office. Butler heard patrol cars being dispatched to check for something that had fallen from the sky in the area of Jolly and Abbott Farm roads. 

Sgt. Marty Burroughs sent three of his deputies to survey for damage, or possibly, a spacecraft between the Ayden Police Department and the two rural roads. They didn't find a thing, not even a small piece of space tin. 

""The main thing we checked were houses to make sure nobody had been hit by anything,"" he said. 

Deputies found the houses to be safe and left the area. 

Burroughs had a dispatcher contact Lenoir and Greene county sheriff's departments to see if a craft had crashed beyond the county line. But nothing was reported. 

A deputy in Ayden and several Greenville officers reported seeing the peculiar light near Pitt Community College at Fire Tower Road and N.C. 11 

""They just said it was moving and it appeared to be descending,"" he said. 

Asked if he thought the light was a UFO, Burroughs said, ""It could have been. I don't know. I can't explain it. 

Sheriff Mac Manning jokingly chalked the sighting up to the work of a shiny red sled and nine flying reindeer. 

""I thought it was maybe Santa Claus making an early run, but we ruled that out pretty quick,"" Manning said. 

Apparently, he said, the light was bright enough and big enough to attract quite a bit of attention. 

Manning said the sighting of whatever-it-was isn't a big deal. Deputies patrolling remote areas of the county report seeing things in the sky all of the time, he said. 

Whatever it was, it scared J.K. Butler ? and his buddies. For two hours they watched the night sky, looking for something, anything that could help complete the puzzle to what they had seen; whether that be little green men or a plane with similar lights. 

He was asked if he'd recently been watching the Sci-Fi channels series on UFOs called ""Taken."" He said he'd never heard of it, and after being informed of the show's angle on alien abductions, he said there's no way he's watching it now.

Unidentified object spotted over Grifton
By Jana Clancey, The Daily Reflector
Creatures from outer space may have been checking on the affairs of Pitt County residents Friday night. 

Several people from Farmville to the southern tip of Pitt County reported an odd light racing across the night sky. 

J.K. Butler, a former Grifton volunteer firefighter, was sitting in the old Red and White parking lot about 11 p.m. Friday. He was there with three fire department friends when the sky around them lighted up, coloring everything from the ground to the trees to themselves a strange shade of green and blue. 

The light passed over them, he said. And when they looked up, it was so blinding they couldn't identify the object. 

""We all just looked at each other like, 'What in the world was that?'"" Butler said. ""I've seen meteors and space junk and satellites. I ain't never seen anything that color.

Thick forest was on both sides of the autobahn restricting my view to the east and west.  It was a sunny, clear day.  Suddenly I saw a large, silver cylinder object streaked across the autobahn down the road ahead of me, going east.  It seemed to skim the tree tops.  There was no sound at all:  Nothing like an approaching aircraft, helicopter, etc.  This siting happened very quickly because of the incredible speed the UFO crossed the autobahn.  I did not see any wings, nose, or windows, and did not think it was an airplane then or now, especially because of the speed and the fact that it was flying so low.  I immediately asked my ex-husband if he saw the object, but he was either looking another way or dozing, I cannot rememember.  He certainly did not hear anything.  It occurred to me the UFO could be a Pershing II missile test launch, but it was far to large and the Pershing IIs in West Germany at that time were black.  I did not report this siting to anyone, but I know what I saw and it was very odd.

I am a 54 year old licensed professional, with over 7 years in the USAF as a air rescue Corpman. I read of the sighting over Williamsburg, Virginia on November 1 with great interest, as I had a similar experience back in November 1966. Heading east on I-64 from Ashland, Ky to Huntington, WV, I took the(I believe) the 5th Street exit (may have been the 16th Street exit). The exit ramp was uphill to the stop sign at the end of the ramp. It was a weekend night, clear, and little/no traffic. At the top of the ramp, I had the need to relieve myself, so I stopped the car and got out.

While in the ""process"" I gazed to the sky. My father, a WWII AF vet, had instilled in me a very high interest in aircraft, space and the like. While standing there, I noticed an a triangular shaped object (almost exactly the same as described in the Williamsburg report) going straight over my car. If I had been holding a basketball at arms length, the craft was larger.  I imagine that the shape was triangular, as there were around 7 to 9 red lights arranged in an error shape, point at the front, or at least the direction the craft was headed.

I also noted that there was no sound, and the speed of the craft was just over a hover - very slow. I had no fear, just interest. I noted the craft for approximately 40 to 45 seconds, in which time it was still in close proximity to me - again, it was moving very, very slow. Once I finished my ""business"" I sat down in the car, but did not shut the door. I thought to myself that that thing I just saw was just not acting right. I stepped back out of the car and the craft was gone.  I did not sit in the car any more that 3 or 4 seconds.  I had visibility for at least 5 miles in every direction, but the craft was gone.  Returning home, I told my Dad about the incident, and he said, ""you saw something, but who knows what it was"".

The more telling part of the sighting happened the next weekend. My Mother and Father were not living together at this time and I took a trip the next weekend to see my Mom in Oak Hill, WV.  Oak Hill is approximately 85 miles NNE of Huntington. While eating dinner, my Mom began telling me a story about seeing an odd aircraft the preceding weekend.  She and some of her friends were driving from Oak Hill to Charleston, WV, which lies between Oak Hill and Huntington.  Traveling down SRt 61, the road, which is very mountainous, opens up to a wide valley when it comes to the Kanawha River. Upon entering the valley, she and her friends noted an object on the north side of the river, moving SSW, at an extremely slow speed. From the distance they were from the craft (a marble held at arms length, about the same size), she could not determine definite shape or lighting, though she did say she thought the object had a faint red glow.  She and her friends observed the object for a good minute, then the object gained a rate of speed, almost too fast to follow, and almost immediately (from almost zero to bullet speed in an instant) and disappeared from sight.  Two points, (1) I had not told her my story yet and (2)this was the same day/evening I observed the craft in Huntington.

Hello Pete,

It was big and no sound at all.  Must have been fast too; from right over my car to out of sight in 3 to 5 seconds.

Hi, I live in Phoenix Arizona. Here is the accounts of my life since the first sighting. First Sighting: In 1983 or 84 I was at my house at 36th Street and Lupine. We were the back house in a very dark culdisac. It was very dark there and easy to watch the night skies. My stepsister and I noticed three stars above the McDowell Mountains just east of Scottsdale Airport that appeared to be moving very slightly. I don't know how high up they were but it was high. We discussed how they couldn't be helicopters because there wasn't any sound from the blades. We also discussed that they couldn't be planes because the were staying in one spot. They were in a triangle type formation. They looked to be teetering or swaying weightlessly. When we noticed this we immediatly knew we were looking at something very different. They hovered above us silently for about two minutes. Then one of them shot off to the south like a bullet and it was gone. These were the fastest things I have ever seen to this day. The other two hovered a while longer and then one zipped off into the east. The one that remained hovered for about 30 seconds and then it went straight up until we could no longer see it. We were overwhelmed at what we witnessed. You just know when you see something like that what it is and you know inside what you have seen, it's like they connect with you somehow. We later watched the news and saw reports of people calling in seeing what we had seen. My life forever changed after that night. I began to have feelings of insight or intuition as I call it. The night of my time loss: I was at a party in the desert with some freinds and it was getting late so decided that it was time to leave. Nobody would give me a ride back into town so I started to walk. I walked a distance about half way to town and I noticed the sky above me began to pulse an intense blue flashing strobe and I don't remember anything after that or losing any time but that 30 minute walk took 2 hours longer than it should have. I know I lost about two t! o three hours and arrived just outside of town, how did I walked that far without knowing it. That was a very scary night. I began to get migrains after that night that hurt so bad I would almost pass out and vomit. I had never even had a headache before that night. It's all very strange and confusing. I have predicted things like putting on my seatbelt 10 seconds before my wife and I were involved in an accident, I had a feeling something was about to happen and put on the seatbelt real fast and the next thing I know we were involved in a pretty serious accident. I was with a freind at a late night movie asked him for some strange reason to look up at the lights and at that exact moment the entire parking lights(about 50) all shut off at that second. Even I was freaked out by this, I don't know why I asked him to look at them, I just did and that still trips me out. There are many more occassions where these types of things happened to me.  Recently we were at Lord of the Rings Two Towers and I had a feeling something was wrong at home, I leaned over during the movie and I asked my wife if she left the Christmas lights on at home because it was a three hour movie, I was sensing or worrying about fire. When we arrived at  home I found a candle my step-daughter had left burning on her desk shelf and it was starting to burn the shelf above, my wife was amazed by this! It might seem trivial, but something as simple as driving someplace, feeling when to leave with my intuition and I experience no traffic and make it through every green light. Does anyone else experience these types of things? I was able to start putting computers together without any knowledge of them. I automatically knew how they worked and I instantly knew how to build them. There are many more things I have experienced but it would take all day to write them down, and I feel very strange writing about this. It feels better to finally get this off my chest. Thanks

we lived on top of a mountian outside of Williamsport, to the south..  It was night and my brother was outside trying to shoot bats with a shot gun when we heard him yell for us to come out, we could tell by his voice some thing was wrong.  it was dark with scattered cloud cover their was a bright moon back lighting the clouds. through the clouds we saw a cigar shaped object flying through the sky. it was just over the tops of the trees 25 to 30 feet in the air, it was silver in color with soft yellowish colored windows. their was no visable engines as in a plane, or jet, some type of landing system protruded from the sides, they seamed to be some type of pods like that of the lunar lander. their was no sound at all,  it disapeared flying to the south, south west.  the speed was not fast at all about 5 to 10 miles an hour.  the lenghth was aprox. 30 to 40 feet in length and 8 feet in diameter my mother, father, brother and myself witnessed this. my brother and I are the only ones alive...

A few nights later we all were watching TV and since we lived out in the boonies my dad would go out side to take a leak.  on this night he did his usual thing but when he returned he grabed my brother, the 50 cal. flintlock told my brother to grab the 12 gauge shot gun.  my mother and I followed them out to the porch where my father told us to stay.  about 100 to 125 yards away was the woods, these woods went on for miles before another house was seen.  up in the trees were glowing eyes, hundreds of eyes, or we think they were.  they say thay oposums eyes will give off a glow or reflection.  so thats what we figured they were.  my dad and brother walked up close to the woods but did not go in, they could not tell what they were.

the next night we were a sleep except my father he was watching TV and went outside to go take a leak.  I remember him waking up my brother and again grabing some fire armes.  looking out my bed room window with my mother about 50 yards away was a row of peach trees and some out buildings ( a shed and a garage ) there were 3 sets of eyes, larger than the ones we saw the previous night.  where they were we had some rubarb plants growing so they must have been about 3 feet off the ground.  they were grouped close together about 4 feet from start to finish.  my father pulled the truck up into the yard just pass a stone wall that divied the driveway from the yard.  he turned the lights on high beam to try to see what they were, but they werent bright enough.  he started to walk twards them and my mother yeld at him to stay back.  he stayed back by the truck for a while when I saw him and my brother take aim at them I could see the flash from the 50 cal. flintlock and the flash from the shot gun.  both my father and my brother were good shots from hunting. the eyes never moved.

my father stayed out as long as he could, he did not shoot any more. we tryed to stay awake but we could not, in the morning they were gone...

the next night the same thing except they were on the stone wall.  I was awaken by my father screaming to my brother to get down stairs.  my father and my brother unloaded allmost every rifle we had... 44 mag. rifle, 12 gauge shot gun, 45 cal. cap and ball revolver, 222 rifle, 50 cal. flintlock.  how ever many bullets these would hold is what they shot. the final gun my father reloaded the 45 cal. cap and ball and walked up to them point blank and fired directly into one of the eyes or where the body should be... they never moved.  for all the shells we picked up the next day their was not a stray divit in the ground, no sign that any thing took place.  that was the last we saw of the eyes","Contractor",4,1,"cigar",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1972,1970,2,6,18,"Evening","Northeast",0,1,0,0,0

I know this was a long time ago, and I don't know if it of interest being in the UK.

I cannot remember the exact time or date, as I was only 11 at the time - 23 years ago!  However, I can remember EVERY second of the actual event.

Reading is appx 50 miles west of London, and was on the flight path for Concorde coming into Heathrow.  As it was so close to landing at the time it went overhead, it was very low in the sky, and extremely loud.  Our windows would shake, and phone conversations were impossible for the 20-30 seconds that Concorde was passing overhead.

This particular day was warm, bright blue skies, with a little wispy broken white cloud.  Very clear, very bright.  Myself and appx 5-8 other children were watching Concorde go over, as we always did.

Someone called out:  ""What's that?  Is that a helicopter?"" Someone else: ""Thats NOT a helicopter!"" It was in fact a classic silver disc.  It was flying alongside Concorde (elevations are impossible to judge, but that was the impression).  It flew alongside Concorde, matching it perfectly, for about 30-40 seconds.

It then flew off (flew is the wrong term - it shot off like a bullet!) at a right-angle to it's previous direction of flight.  It flew away and up until it vanished into the clouds.

My brother and I have since independently remembered TWO further events (one while we were at dinner with Budd Hopkins at the Leeds UFO conference funnily enough!).  One was a traingle of white lights hovering over the car, and the other was a bright blue sphere hovering over some woods visible from our (shared) bedroom window at 4.01 am in the morning.  Both of these events were since forgotten, and we independently remembered particular details which agreed.  The concorde sighting has always been crystal clear in my memory.

A couple of years ago I was remembering the Concorde event.  Shortly afterwards I returned to Reading to visit relatives.  I bumped into a friend who I hadn't seen in about 12 years - but I remembered him being there in that playground.  Before we could talk about anything else, I said ""This'll sound weird - do you remember back at Westwood Farm (the school) looking up at Concorde and seeing something?"" He instantly said ""Yeah - a silver disc that shot off"" I replied ""Thank you, I didn't imagine it!""

((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))

Peter,

Thanks very much for coming back to me - I have submitted this report to various places before, but never had a single response!  Thanks.

I will try my best with your questions:

1)  ""At the time of your sighting, which side of the Concorde were you viewing, the right, or left?""

- I was on the ground looking straight up at it as it passed overhead.  EG if I was facing West, it was flying west, and therefore would have been travelling from 'behind' us, overhead, and away in front of us into the distance.

2) ""Also, where was the disc, relative to the Concorde, e.g. ""above"" or ""below"" the aircraft, as you faced it, or ahead or behind it?""

- It's hard to judge relative vertical distances from the ground looking straight up.  But the impression that we all had was that it was flying right alongside.  If that was the case, I don't see how passengers could have missed it!

3) ""In addition, can you provide a detailed description of how the disc moved, relative to the aircraft, i.e. from what direction did it approach; if it hovered close to the aircraft, where was it located; where did the disc go, relative to the flight path of the aircraft?""

- We didn't see it approach unfortunately.  When we all looked up at the concorde it was already there.  Someone spotted it and said ""What's that? Is that a helicopter?""  Once it had been pointed out it was glaringly obvious, as it was shiny silver.  It flew right alongside the plane, matching it's speed perfectly, and then flew off very fast at a right angle to it's previous flight direction.  It may also have been going up at this point, as it disappeared into some clouds.

4) ""Also, what was the relative size of the disc, compared, for example to the diameter of the fuselage of the aircraft?""

- I have attached a (very poor - forgive me!) picture which should indicate the relative sizes.  It was considerably smaller than the plane, but still large enough to be clearly seen.


I have heard you ask people on the Jeff Rense show to do the arms' length description?  I have tried this, and would estimate that at arm's length Concorde would have been appx as long as my thumb at the height it was.  It used to go over pretty low!  The picture (sorry again!) shows the size relative to that.  The dotted line is the departure angle it took.

I hope this helps you to get a picture of the event.  I know how hard it is to picture it without seeing it, as it's so clear to me!

The other witness I have mentioned isn't really a friend, just someone I was at school with.  Apart from that chance encounter a few years back we've never spoken since school.  He was pretty taken aback when this was the first thing I asked him about!  However, I will try my best to find out 
where he is now and ask him to submit a report.

I know this happened a long time ago but I have just found this site and wanted to tell my story anyway. I was 12 and lived in the small Tn. town of Englewood. I had been riding a motorcycle most of the day, just following a path on my Grandparents small farm. I was tired and went in to lay down for a little bit before supper. I don't know if I fell asleep or not? I don't think I did. I opened my eyes and looked out the window. There hovering above the trees was what I only knew of as a flying saucer. The only way I knew what it was, was from what I had seen on buggs and roadrunner cartoons. By the way we only got 2 tv channels back then. I jumped up and went to the window. Then I went tearing out of the house to see it, while screaming for my Grandmother to come look. I still remember my exact words(Grandma! Grandma! you got to come see this), I ran out from under the trees to get a better look. It was just hovering there at the tree tops not making a sound. Then just as if someone was standing right by my side I heard a voice say to me (you are not supposed to see this). I never felt so much fear in my young life. Then as my Grandma exited the house and was coming toward me it just raised up about 50 feet and shot off like a bullet. I will never forget telling her that I knew she would not beleive me. But to my suprise she said she did, because she had herself several years before that. This has haunted me for years and changed my life forever. I could no longer beleive in the biblical things my Grandmother had always taught me. At age 25 I tried hypno therapy. I went 8 times but could never get pasted what I could remember already. The guy said it was too tramatic for me to remember. But he learned me some relaxation techniques. I later learned I had been abducted many times as a child and lots of things came together for me. I just wanted to share this and say that no matter what anybody might say about UFO's they are real and so are the grays. Thanks for leting me get this out.

At 5:45 PM on 3/27/2003 I was driving eastward on Highway 7 in a rural area about halfway between Winchester and Berryville, Virginia. My wife was in our vehicle with me when we both saw an extremely shiny metallic-looking object flying northward about one mile ahead of us. The object was traveling at about 400-500 mph (based on my experience as a licensed airplane pilot) about 200 feet above the tree tops. It was difficult for me to determine a distinct shape, but my wife, who had more time to observe the object because I was driving, said it was cone-shaped or bullet-shaped. The object traveled in a straight line and at constant altitude until it was no longer visible over the tree-lined horizon after observing it for about 10 seconds. We heard no sound.

 Now, after almost fifteen years, I will tell this story as I can assume that the only others who will be reading this are for the most part those who believe in this stuff. My story is hardly the fodder from which films are made of, I was not abducted, nor did I have any implants or anything of that sort.

But I will tell this anyways.

It feels good to do so...  It was the summer of 1987. This was the year I graduated High School. I do not recall the exact date. This takes place in Missouri, about an hour and a half South East of Kansas City (+/-). Whiteman Air Force Base, now the home of the B-2 bomber, was at the time a missile base. It is about 30 to 45 minutes away from where this happened. To this day there are countless old missile silos scattered throughout this countryside, though they have been dismantled as far as I know.

 A friend of mine, as well as one of my uncles decided to go to a place outside of our hometown of Windsor, known as ""Windsor Crossing."" Windsor Crossing is about fifteen minutes from Windsor, at the edge of Truman Lake, which in reality is the outer edge of the Ozarks. It is a much larger drink of water than what the word ""lake"" implies. At Windsor Crossing is a campground, as well as a dock to put boats out onto the lake, and a ""beach."" Our plan for the evening was to go to the beach and go for a late night swim. Given the humid summers that Missouri experiences, this seemed like a great idea at the time. My two companions rode along with me, and I parked my car away from the beach as it was forbidden (dare I say ""Illegal"") to go swimming there after dark-for our own safety of course.

 After our swim, all three of us went up onto the beach and lay down on the sand. The night was cool as I remember it. The sky was clear and dark blue, punctured by the pinhole-sized stars that littered the night too numerous to count. It was a very beautiful evening.

As the three of us laid there on that beach talking, the conversation ultimately resolved itself to silence. Several moments passed. Then as always seems to be the case, when it is a beautiful night, the stars out, etc, somebody has to speak up about space, parallel universes, and things of that ilk. The guy that came along with my uncle and I was saddled with the nickname ""C((name deleted))."" The reason behind this is simply because of his haircut. I won?t bore you with the details. Anyway, ((nickname deleted)) was the one guilty of breaking the silence with ""Wouldn?t it be cool if we saw a UFO?"" This was immediately greeted with a reprimand by none other than myself. I sat up in the sand and forcefully declared that no such thing existed, and that it was downright stupid for him to even bring it up. It was a beautiful, clear summer night. That was the reality of the moment. It seemed ridiculous to contaminate such a nice midnight swim with silly speculations of another race from outer space.

C((nickname deleted)) snorted something under his breath that vaguely resembled an apology. After several minutes, we all toweled the sand off of ourselves, got dressed and made way to my Toyota Celica (1978 GT. Moon roof.  Damn fine car. And I don?t like Japanese cars.) Windsor crossing is on Y highway between Windsor and a little speck of a town called ""Tightwad. Tightwad is only two minutes up the road past Windsor Crossing. This is significant as my girlfriend all during high school lived there. This meant I spent a great deal of time on that highway, naturally. So I was very familiar with all the details of that road. Where all the houses where. Where all of the lights where.

And where lights should not be.

 As we were moving down Y towards Windsor, we came to the only stop on that highway. A stop sign at a 4-way in the middle of nowhere. We passed it. As our conversation continued (to this day I have no recollection what it was about), I noticed way out in the distance what looked like an amber light over a field (there are lots of fields in Missouri.). It did not register with me as I was immersed in a conversation of so much importance that I cannot recollect what in the heck it was about. So I filed the light waaaaaay in the back of my mental Rolodex.

Our conversation continued.

As we drew closer to the light, at this point it was still about a mile or so away, it demanded my attention again. It had suddenly dawned on me that there was no house in that area, save for one farm on the other side of Y highway. It could not be a lamppost; I would have seen it from all of my excursions to my girlfriend?s house in Tightwad. Cows of course, have no need for a lamppost out in the middle of a field.

The light now had my attention.

 I interrupted the conversation between my uncle T((name deleted)) and C((name deleted)) and drew their attention to the light.

As best I can remember, from that point on we were silent till we drew closer to the light. I pulled my car over to the right side of the road and all three of us got out to take a look at what was over the field.

This is what happened to the best of my recollection:  An amber light hung suspended over the field not quite two stories high. To give you an idea of what the light looked like to me, imagine looking at a streetlight through a foggy windshield. It had streaks that came out from the main source, but not sharply, they were not long streaks, just stationary. The light made no sound. Behind it was a single row of trees. I will describe the setting to give you an idea of the distance as best as I can recall it. Y highway is a lone country road out in the middle of nowhere. It is mostly used by the few that live down that road, and the summer traffic going to the lake. At well past midnight, we were the only ones on this road. This small road has no streetlights. So it is dark, save for the house light in the distance, or the occasional traffic lights.

From where we were parked at the side of this two-way road, you could walk across it, cross a ditch and come to a fence. You could easily climb the four or five foot fence, take about thirty steps past it, and you would be beneath this thing. You could throw a rock and easily hit it.

The three of us stood there and said nothing. We just looked at this light. It made no sound. It moved not an inch. It just hung there. An amber light with soft streaks emanating from it.

This is the part that I struggle to understand, much less explain to others: I do not know how this happened, nor do I recall seeing it happen at all. One second I/we were looking at this light floating over a field, and the next thing I know is that the light is no longer there, but what rested in it?s place was what we all know as that familiar cigar shape. Its outline could easily be made out against the clear blue night sky, punctured with millions of stars.

This cigar shape seemed to me to be about the length of two or three full-sized cars. Around it was blocks of colors. Green, yellow and blue. These colors did not move. The cigar shape did not move.

At this point, I tried to gather information about what I was seeing.

It was near a row of tall trees, yet the leaves on the trees rustled only when a soft summer breeze passed. It made no sound. Not a hum that I could hear. Nothing. I could make out the blades of grass in the moonlight. They rustled not a bit.

I looked over at T((name deleted)), and he was silent. I looked over at my friend C((name deleted)), and he was silent too. My attention turned back to the cigar shape that hovered silently, effortlessly, over this field.

I have no idea of how long we stood there and looked at it. I was not scared, quite to the contrary, I felt very peaceful. If I felt anything, it was the urge to run across the road, jump the fence, and run up and try to touch it. But I did not. As the tree of us stood there, I recall us saying things to one another, yet I cannot remember what it was.

 After several minutes, the cigar shape slowly rose up, over the treetops and lowered itself behind them, as if it was trying to hide from us! It was only one row of trees, so we could still easily make out the lights on its side, as well as the cigar shape. After what seemed like a short amount of time there, it again lifted up over the trees and went away from us. We jumped into my Celica (Damn fine car.), and sped down the highway following it. Ultimately, it stopped over a field. We parked the car on a curve that ran along side a hill that looked down on this field. At this point I was convinced that what we were seeing was indeed not a helicopter, or some kind of airplane. From beneath this (what I will now call a-) UFO shone a bright, concentrated white light. The light?s edges softened outward from its center. This light swept over the filed in patterns I did not recognize or find any logic to. It looked very random to me. After a few moments of this, at the blink of an eye, it was very high up in the sky and way out in the distance (and without even the slightest sound). Those lights around it now seemed to be rotating around it. Eventually, it was over the horizon. It would dip below the tree line, and then would pop back up again. It did this a couple of more times before it disappeared, never to be seen by us again.

 The conversation back to Windsor was dominated naturally, by what the three of us had become witnesses to. I dropped off my Uncle and my friend, but did not go home. Instead, I found myself driving around my hometown of 3,000 people just trying to process what was going around in my head. I eventually came to the parking lot of a grocery I worked at during high school and came across one of my co-workers there. I pulled up to his car. His window was rolled down and I could see his face. It was an expressionless mask, his eyes were hollow, and his skin as white as a sheet of paper. The first thing out of my mouth was-""D((name deleted)), you won?t believe what I just saw!""  D((name deleted)) interrupted me and said, ""I know what you just saw. It was a UFO.""  His voice trembled, and there was very much a tone of concern to it. He had tried but failed to hide his fright.

 While we were on that hill on Y highway watching this thing bounce above and below the horizon?as it turns out, it was over another small town that is called Calhoun. D((name deleted)) girlfriend lived there. According to him, he and his girlfriend were sitting on the porch of her house, which has an awning over it, when he said he felt what amounted to a low rumble. A strong low hum. This caught my interest, as I did not hear any noise whatsoever from the UFO when I saw it.

The two of them sat there and from over her house this thing gently sailed over. They watched this, every bit of it as it stopped over her front yard, right in front of them. Then it went up high, above the tree line, and then back down, and then back up. According to D((name deleted)), it did this a few times before it ultimately shot up into the air and disappeared. This seems to match what we had witnessed on that highway, watching this thing go above the horizon, within our view, and then dip below our view a few times before ultimately disappearing. The UFO was described to me by D((name deleted)) as being saucer shaped, and metallic silver. This was all I could get out of him. He was visibly shaken and went home. I rode around town for several more minutes and did not see him again.

 I went home and looked at the clock and saw that it was about 3 am. I do not believe I lost any time as I can honestly believe that the incidents, including the time I spent driving aimlessly around town, realistically could have burned a couple of hours.

 The next time I ran into D((name deleted)), he was able to chat about it briefly, but he made it obvious that he wanted to put the whole experience behind him. In a small farming community, you could be the laughingstock of the whole town if you went around proclaiming to have seen a UFO.

  Well there you go. All 2,206 words of it.

I never believed in anything if I could not reach out and touch it. This rule especially applied to UFO?s. My companions and I were not drunk, nor where we on any kind of drugs. We were just three guys on our way home from a swim.  That night, fifteen years ago, I saw something that I know with every fiber of my existence, answered my question of ""Is there life out there?"" Well I am now here to tell you that I believe that there is. And now that I have thought about it for years, and finally shared it with you. I am now saddled with an even bigger question: Why are they here?

I was 8 years old at the time and used to go out at around 6:00 am to play by myself, then return to my house in time for breakfast.  This was sometime in July or August 1961. It was during the summer vacation.  It was about 6:30 when I chanced to look up. I saw a large bright silver, cylinder or oval shaped craft I immediately took for a jet or passenger plane.  I thought it might be from the Skead (Falconbridge Airforce base). I was used to seeing planes from there, but only during the Air Show. The base is just south of Falconbridge, the  nickel mining town I lived in.

 The craft made no noise but it was on west to east and certainly a crash trajectory. I dropped everything and went to see where it crashed. It was headed into a horseshoe shaped hole in the ground about three hundred meters long and 200 meters wide. The east side of the pothole (this is what we called it) rose to about 25-30 meters high and the walls declined to about ground level with the rest of the town, the west end being level.  There was nothing there so I went to the east side up on top of the hill and looked to the east into the mines and saw nothing also.  I then went home totally perplexed and very hungry.

 When I arrived home, my mother asked me where I had been all day and I tried to tell her that I wanted to have breakfast but she said that I had missed breakfast and lunch but made me a sandwich.

 I suffered no trauma what so ever but I am completely baffled about the situation.  For one, I had heard nothing or knew anything about UFO?s.  I also have a bullet shaped mark on my left shin. When I was about 14 or 15 years old, I showed it to my doctor and he said that it had to be made by a deep puncture. I remember nothing about any puncture, nor do my siblings and parents know about something like that. The doctor said it was large enough to have had to have stitches. I remember no such event.

 There are many other mysteries to this event that have occurred at later dates.  But just the sighting and the lost time are enough.  Please e-mail me or call as this has been inside of me for a long time and I have told no one other than my brother about this. Should I pursue this?  What do I do next?  Who do I talk to? As I said before, this hasn?t traumatized me but I am very curious and confused about this.  Please let me know.

This account is true and describes what a I, along with a friend, witnessed today in the skies over Lenexa, Kansas.

 Around 12:35 in the afternoon today, 06/09/03, after unloading some very heavy 6x6 posts, I had reclined on my back on the deck I was building to catch my breath.  I looked up into a nearly cloudless blue sky and just happened to see something streaking across the sky directly above us.  I watched it for a few moments, trying to identify it in my own mind, but had no luck making sense of it at all.  It seemed to be a small spot of silvery white, made no noise at all, and really had no discernable shape other than spherical.  It looked small, and moved incredibly fast, moving from horizon to horizon directly overhead in little more than about 10 seconds.  My first thought was it was my first daylight glimpse of a satellite, but it moved much too fast for that.

 My brother and I grew up watching and counting orbiting satellites at night in the skies over Wyoming, so I'm very familiar with how they move, but had never seen one in daylight.  I discounted the idea, realizing it didn't seem to be high enough to be in orbit.  As the object neared the far horizon, on a Southwesterly to Northeasterly course, I suddenly sat bolt upright, the realization hitting me that I couldn't identify what I had been watching, and said to my friend, ""What the hell is that?!""  He didn't see it and I immediately tried to point it out to him but as I did it faded from visibility into the distant sky.  I described it to him, still looking skyward, saying, ""God, I wish you had seen that..."", when suddenly there was another, coming from roughly the same direction, on the same general heading as the first, Northeast.  I quickly pointed this one out to my friend, and he immediately spotted it and began tracking it across the sky.

 Now I consider myself a serious aviation enthusiast, and I know military aircraft better than most people, even other enthusiasts.  I served in the Air Force as a flight line mechanic, and my buddy who was with me served in the Navy where he specialized in guided missiles, so it's my opinion we both understand basic propulsion systems, the dynamics of flight, and the capabilities - AND the limitations of manned flight.  Neither of us could explain what we were seeing, we thought through all the possibilities we could think of, everything from high flying experimental aircraft, to cotton seeds floating on the breeze to meteors entering the earth's upper atmosphere and burning up.  There were inherent flaws with each of these possibilites though... the objects didn't ""float"" on any breeze, they were on a laser straight course and moving at a very high rate of speed, they didn't seem to be burning or breaking up as any other meteor does, they didn't emit any sound whatsoever, left no vapor trails or contrails... almost as if they didn't disturb the air at all.  And any aircraft moving as fast as these were would most certainly have broken the sound barrier and delivered the telltale thunderous 'clap'.

 As we stood staring in utter disbelief at the sky, the object quickly disappeared beyond the horizon to our Northeast.  We frantically searched the sky for any other activity, and to our surprise after a minute or two there came another object, again moving from the same general direction.  That made three so far, and again we both watched in amazement.  They all headed the same direction, yet each was on it's own trajectory.  Some looked slightly larger than others, giving the indication of a difference in altitude, though that's tough to speculate on, not knowing the size of the objects.

 By this time I tried to call my wife (exacly 12:44pm according to my cell phone log)but only got her voicemail.  I then dialed my brother in Idaho and excitedly told him what we were witnessing, as we spoke.  They kept coming, a few minutes apart, until we counted six altogether.  At one point, I watched one of the objects (which seemed either larger or lower in altitude) moving at a slower pace than the rest.  As it neared the far horizon, roughly 70% of the way across the viewable sky, it seemed to suddenly accelerate.  We called the homeowner out after seeing the 6th object, hoping for a 3rd set of eyes to confirm what we were seeing, but by the time he got outside it was gone from view, and with that, our encounter was over.  We watched the skies intermittently for the next hour or so, but saw nothing more.

 While the activity was ongoing, we considered taking digital pictures, but realized it would be pointless because the camera couldn't possibly capture such small points in the sky with any clarity.  Plus we just didn't think we'd keep seeing more of them so we just stood transfixed, trying to debunk what we were starting to suspect.

 This was my first sighting of anything I could consider as even possibly having been of a non-terrestrial nature.  I was excited, yet still questioned whether I had just seen what I had just seen, if that makes sense.  Like everyone else, I had seen the movies, heard the stories, seen the picures and read eye-witness accounts of similar encounters.  I had always suspected something or someone else was out there, but I'd never seen anything firsthand.  Now suddenly here I am confronted with my own personal evidence - and understand I can't completely convince anyone else of what we saw - but now I have firsthand knowledge of something that supposedly doesn't exist.  I've seen something I can't explain, and it's been a very profound experience, mentally, spiritually and emotionally.

 I'm a husband and father of two beautiful baby girls, I have a happy life, and I've got nothing to prove to anyone.  I hope nothing more than to share with others what I experienced myself today, because I would hope others would not be afraid to do the same, only then can we hope for enlightenment about who we are as a people, and how ""they"" fit into our existence.

Dear Sir.   I tried to transfer my video of the event from my camra, but Ill have to find another way to do it.  Thr first plane,(possibly an F-16), came from the South.

I was standing where I could still see to the south from our yard.  I vodeo-taped the second air craft, heading from the South to the North, crossing the Straights into Canada.

Just before this round object hit the belly of this jet.  The lights on both wings and the tail flashed on together.  The round object went under the facing wing.  And out the back.  What looks like spray can be seen on the tape.  But the round object can again be seen leaving the tail of the air craft and continuing West.

((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS

Dear Director,

My brother and I called you on the 21st to report something hitting a jet above our home here in Port
Angeles.  I then wrote again to say that we were trying to get a freeze-frame from this video to show
you.  Well they are in, but I can only send two your way right now.

Last night we had called the Coast Guard again about what was seen over our heads.  They told us it had to be reported to the Sheriffs Office.  After the cop saw the tape, he wanted to bring a friend of his who knows about ballistic missiles...because that is the most logical explanation, but they did not return.
My brother is now convinced that someone shot a rocket at a plane, which makes sense in a way.  However, if it was a rocket!!

I on the other hand still think it is an un-identified- flying object.  If you want to write back we will be here.  Thank you!  ((name deleted

I am a college professor and joined four college men on the hike near Slate Peak, the highest place you can drive in Washington state in the North Cascade mountains near the Canadian border. The 6,600 feet elevation trail head is at an old air force listening station manned in the 1940s which is now marked by an unmanned observation tower closed to the public.

 Our camp was about five miles north east of the trail head on a very isolated ridge with no other campers for miles and miles. The Pasayten Wilderness is one thousand square miles. While a very large forest fire was burning in an eastern region of the wilderness, we were at a safe distance. The fire was at a much lower elevation about 35 miles east and two valleys and mountain ranges away.

 The first night of our excursion, we were sitting around a small camp fire above the lake looking at a perfectly clear night sky. Then a few minutes after 11 PM we saw a bright light like an airplane in the south east above the mountain ridge skyline about 50 degrees high. It moved like a helicopter, but made no sound. It seemed to be about three or four miles away moving north west, seemingly flying above the Slate Peak observation tower.

 Suddenly something shot out of the light. We were astonished. ""Did you guys see that!"", I said. Yes, all but one student agreed.  He didn't bring his glasses and couldn?t see that clearly, but the other four of us all witnessed it. It looked like a shooting star, except it shot out of the airplane-like-light down towards the south east. We immediately thought that perhaps the projectile was a shooting star that just happened to shoot behind the light at the right moment, giving an illusion that the light was the source. Then one student said, ""Yea, but what are the odds that a shooting star would appear at exactly that point?"" We agreed that the sight was amazingly poignant.

 The light then appeared to be moving directly towards us, as if to fly over our lake.  And I said, ""It must be a Forest Service helicopter. Put out the fire."" There was a burn ban which I admit we were not obeying. Moments after the fire was put out with a bottle of water, the light turned away from us and moved directly east. It floated lazily, as if taking in the scenery. It did not move like a helicopter doing a job. And there was no sound. The light moved away and faded into the horizon, turning reddish as it  apparently disappeared behind the atmosphere. We witnessed the strange light for about five or six minutes.

 We tried to think of what it could be. One of the group remarked that it couldn't be an airplane or jet because there was no discernable shape, no sound and looked like a single, bight ball of light, like a head light pointing at you. His father is a pilot and he seemed sure that it was not a fixed winged aircraft. We had seen Forest Service spotter aircraft looking for lightening fires all day long and could hear the roar of their engines long before we could see them. We all joked that maybe this light was a UFO.

 The next day, I took out my compass and topo map and plotted what I thought was the line of flight. Then I realized that the light seemed to out line the eastern side of the wild fire about 35 miles away. Maybe it was farther away than we thought. So, I told the men that it must have been Forest Service helicopter shuttling fire fighting crews or dropping water or fire retardant.

 Then on Monday evening we had another sighting. This time about 9 PM, after sun set but before you could see any stars, one of the men looked up at the same spot to the east and said, ""Look, the light is back!"" This time we saw the same intense point of light acting like an airplane flying away. We saw it for about one minute. It certainly looked exactly like the night before, except that we didn't get to watch it for very long to notice any thing strange. There was not sound.

 Tuesday the weather turned to rain and thunder storm clouds obscured the night sky. We later learned that this storm caused some small fires in a valley to the north west of our lake. In the afternoon on Wednesday, we heard a helicopter approaching. Then a large K-Max helicopter flew over our lake tugging a 300 gallon scoop. It hovered over the lake, scooped up water then made a wide turn along the ridge and flew over our camp into the hills to the north to drop water on a small fire caused by the lightening the day before. In about five minutes it returned. The third time we heard it approaching we ran down to the lake to get a close up view. We were directly under the chopper as it hovered. It was huge and make a sound so loud that my ears are still ringing. We noticed blinking lights on the tail and end of the fuselage. It made five water scooping trips.

 But, later we reflected on the contrast between the chopper and the light on Sunday and Monday nights. It seemed even more strange. Unlike the chopper, there was no sound. There were no blinking lights. It moved slow and funny. The projectile shooting out of it. That just could not be a helicopter.

 We hiked out on Thursday to stay at a hotel before driving home to Seattle on Friday. The ski lodge hotel was catering breakfast and lunches for fire fighter crews because their base camp was a half mile away. As I paid our bill, I met a director of the ground crew operations and asked him questions about the type of aircraft fighting the fire. He said that they use Bell helicopters to shuttle the crews and K-Max choppers to scoop and drop water. I didn?t reveal why I was asking him all of these questions, but he ended by referring me to a forest service information officer at a head office in the town of Tonasket.

 Then I asked one more question, ""Do the helicopters work at night?""  ""Oh, no,"" he said.  ""They have to be able to see.""","college professor",0,0,"light",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2003,2000,3,8,23,"Night","West",0,1,0,1,0

We just wanted to bring to ""light"" something that we saw now that this article has been written. A few months back, we are ""best guessing"" in May, We were both laying in bed, and we both awoke about 3:00 a.m. to a bright yet soft orange/amber light shining in our bedroom window. While it filled the entire side of windows (bedroom and back door) we felt it odd and yet not concerning enough to get up from bed to investigate the light. Neither of us heard anything but were both awaked by the light. We furthermore didn't even discuss it until the next morning when one of us asked the other if they had seen it. To our amazement we had both not only seen it, but didn't say anything at the time thinking the other was  asleep. the next morning we joked about the possibility of the light being from a UFO as we tried to come up with ANY possible occurrences to account for how the light not only filled the windows but from where it appeared to originate, which was to the right side of the house and up. The light seemed as strong as a searchlight and yet as I said soft in color. No other noise was heard at the time and we BOTH saw the light and didn't mention it to the other until the next day. As best as we can recall, we are thinking the event happened either somewhere during the weekend of 5/2-5/11 or the weekend of 5/16-5/25. Neither of us have ever made any reports of this nature and it is only because of the article that we do now. We are interested to know if you have had any other reports of this nature during the May timeframe. We did ask our neighbor the following day if she had seen the light as we were new to this area. She had indicated she didn't because her bedroom did not face the same direction. We being new to the area didn't make any further note as we just didn't know what it could have been. Thank you for listing to us and we are actually quite interested in finding out if there ha! ve been any other reports of like type. Sincerely,  Thank you to the witness for the report.

(Sorry for my poor English) I was canoeing in the Point Pelee?s march (part of Lake Erie) South Ontario when, observing a duck flying over, an object flying in the sky behind the duck caught my attention.  I showed it to my wife and we observed it together. The shape appeared to be like a cylinder with the center part being narrower than the extremities. The object was about half an inch if I would size it with my fingers and had a solid white color with no visible wings and was flying East very fast and silently. There was no trail. I was trying to identify the object but could not. The speed and the shape appeared out of the ordinary. Was it a missile?   The object crossed half the sky where I started to see it to a cloud far away in 15 seconds. I was hearing a little bit the waves of the beach in the background and I thought this could cover the sound of the reactor if there was one. But the speed Between the position when I first spot it and the cloud, I estimate conservatively the distance to be about 5 miles. Five miles in 15 seconds is appreciatively 1700 per second!  When I finally realized the strangeness of this object, I tried to take a picture but the object was already too far and too small to be seen through the screen of my digital camera.","Statistician-SAS Programmer",2,1,"cylinder",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2003,2000,3,8,19,"Evening",NA,0,1,0,0,0

I saw two balls of light, which I commonly describe them as headlight-sized to others. One light was higher than the second light, and to the left of it. The lights were headlight-sized from my vantage point, but were incredibly high. Because of my perception of height, I had judged the lights to be much larger than any aircraft known to man, possibly being hundreds of feet in diameter. I did not observe any contrails or vapors eminating from the lights. The time of day was beginning to turn to twilight and the skies were blue. I was driving eastbound on Forest Hill Blvd and first witnessed them around the intersection of Jog Rd. At first, the lights appeared to be static, just staying in one place. Then, the lights appeared to begin to rise slowly upward and began to fade in intensity. The lights then disappeared, but there was an incredibly large hazy halo left behind for each light. The lights were gone before I reached the intersection of Military Trail. For weeks afterward, I tried to find further information on this incident. I did recall some online articles trying to discount it as military missiles, which from experience could not have been fired from Cape Canaveral. I think the article went on to say that it was ship fired missiles and another article said they were missiles fired over the Florida Panhandle from one side to the other side. Problem being, that I did not witness any East, West, North, or South movement of the lights. I did not witness any vapors or contrails. The only thing those lights did was appear to remain static at a great height, then rise straight up. My life experience is U.S. Military and Law Enforcement.

We two were walking South along Mission Beach boardwalk and observed craft moving South or East.  It appeared just as a white light, approx. 1/2 the (current)magnitude of Mars and covered about 20 degrees of arc in approximately 4 seconds in a straight path.  We think it was in front of some clouds at some point, so don't think it was astronomical in nature.  Was similar to a satellite, except brighter and much too rapid (as well as for any known aircraft). On the other hand, it was  much too slow to have been a meteor.  No sound could be heard, nor navigation markers seen. Very puzzling, and I have observed the sky casually and as amateur astronomer for several decades.  Have seen missile tests in the atmosphere as well, and this didn't resemble that (also doubtful such a test would be performed so apparently close to populated area).  For me (us) it was definitely an unidentifiable flying object!

I was serving at F.E. Warren AFB in Wyoming, I was on duty in the Missile Field doing the night shift. I was actually at Romeo site which is an installation of F.E. Warren AFB. I went outside to smoke a cigarette and saw a extremely bright light in the sky. It wasn't huge, It looked about the size of a plane you'd see in the air. The light moved around for about 20 seconds then all of the sudden it flew away very fast, leaving a white bright tail behind it. I thought I was going nuts or was just possably sleep deprived, but when I told another flight mate of mine, he told me that himself as well as many others had seen the exact same thing over the skies of Wyoming late at night on numerous occasions. I had only seen it once but it I know for a fact that it wasnt a plane and it wasnt a blimp and no shooting stars moves around slowly for approximately 20 seconds and then just shoots off.

About 3:45AM one morning I was awakened to a noise coming from my three-year-old son's room.  Eventhough there was a rain and electrical storm outside I could hear this noise, like a clicking sound with some occasional high-pitched  gurgling.  Concerned that my son might be having some breathing problems I sat up in bed and directed my attention to the hallway where his door was.  It startled me that his door was closed, as we had never closed his door in the past.  Again I heard the noise and even though I tried for a brief moment to wake my wife I could not rouse her.  Again and again I heard the noise and was quite terrified that someone possibly was in my son's room.  I quickly gathered my courage and went to my closet for my S&W 45 caliber semi-automatic pistol.  I chambered a round and moved to my son's door putting my ear against the door.  Again I heard the sounds and burst into the room.  What I saw next will never leave me... something I think about several times every day since then.  The way my son's room was laid out was my son's little bed was to the left of the open door and a window was directly ahead.  Even though the light was off, a moment after I burst in I looked directly into my son's bed as lightening illuminated the room. I could see my son setting up in bed facing a small alien creature as if they were playing or something.  Simultaneously I realized the window was open, the screen was off and there was a larger alien creature somehow hovering just outside the window.  The rain was pouring into the open window and I have learned since then that the best way I could describe the creature is that it was a ""Grey"".  I was petrified and could not move.  I could tell by it's movements that I startled the alien outside the window as much as it startled me.  The next thing I know, I am laying on the floor looking up at the lightening painting the ceiling and realized that my entire backside is soaking wet, the window open, it was not raining and my son was sound asleep in his little bed. ! Later I found my 45 laying in the center of the dinning room table with the magazine removed and one bullet (the chambered round) missing.  I have not been able to reconcile this event to this date.  The window was certainly open, the screen on the ground two floors below (we lived on the second floor) and the carpet was soaked.  In addition, the missing bullet was never found.  I don't know how long I was out or why I was out but it could not have been more that a couple hours.  I know this was a Grey who, for some reason, was letting it's child play with mine.

About a month before mars was at its closest, i was looking at the moon when a bright star suddenly caught my attention (from above left of mars facing north), when i looked at it i realised it was moving and gradually getting smaller and dimmer, i kept looking after it disappeared (2-3 mins) and about 5 minutes later i saw a very dim light moving from pretty much exactly were mars was. as the new light reached the point where i noticed the previous bright light, it seemed to explode and got much lighter. it then followed the path of the previous light exactly (as near as i could tell)gradually fading out at the same point as the previous one.

As reported to Art Bell in October 2000, I was fortunate enough to see a Triangular UFO from my home deck in Aurora, CO.  I was out on the deck of my house about 10:00PM looking with binoculars looking out at the city and stars. A huge triangular object at least two football fields in size suddenly appeared from the south above my house.  It was coming from the south direction near NORAD in Colo. Spgs.  It was Triangular in shape, and definitely had cloaking or stealth capability.  It was travelling at a slow rate of speed over my house, and following the I225 corridore parallel to Buckley AFB.  The whole interior of the craft was lighted when decloaked and I could see inside the craft as it passed me.  It had huge rectangular wing spars which may have been power sources or generators.  The control center at the front of the craft was all lighted.  As it was parallel to Buckley AFB (classified-Radar Domes)it started to cloak or go into a stealth mode and as it proceeded North and disappeared.  The amazing part, is Denver International Airport to the north uses this area as a holding pattern for commercial jets landing but, it did not seam to interfere with the Triangular UFO as it slowly moved along the interstate.

PREFACE:  I have two homes up here in the Mojave Desert, both aviation testing heavens for aviation buffs. One is Near China Lake and the other is on top of a hill in remote location just north of Edwards AFB (EAFB).

 The EAFB place is directly under a heavily used,  supersonic low altitude corridor so we see all the military''s good stuff being tested and passing directly over our house 24 hours per day.  (B2, B1, F-117, F-22, JSF, NASA-Dryden stuff, Osprey, C-17 and many other test models.  So we here are battle hardened when it comes to ""UFO"" sightings and many folks just take them for granted due to the heavy activity out here of experimental stuff going on.

 Most of us ""literate"" residents of this area know our planes and the generalities and the specifics of sensitive and public projects going on at EAFB/China Lake, etc. because we work there or at Plant 42 (Palmdale) or at famous Mojave civilian airport.

 The stuff that goes on at these three locatations is cutting edge.  In fact, the lead British test pilot testing Lockheed's version of the F-22 Raptor was over at my home one day visiting and he said they use my EAFB-area house as a marker from the sky.  That explains why we get buzzed several times a day and why our drywall nails are popping out.

 With all that said, please advise that I know my planes, I have better than 2010 vision, have flown helicopters, am an amateur astronomer with a Celestron C-8 (with ""go to"") and a Cave Optics 10"" Newtonian telescope.

 I have a wife that is a pilot (we are both scientists) and we have large personal photo archive of really tight shots of just about everything (declassified) that has passed by our house.

 Anyway, September 19 I was do my morning mountain bike ride on the I-58 frontage roads on the north side of Edwards AFB (which is west of Mojave). Three silver fighters (not white or black matte or grey) passed over headign north about 1000 feet AGL and about 10 feet off the wing of one of them was a grey flying cylinder about 4-6 feet long. It was NOT being towed and it was NOT a cruise missile, NOT a drone (I am familiar with them from NAWC Weapons-Point Magu), nor was it the Predator or Dark Star, etc.

 It had no visible exhaust, no rudder could be seen, no canards or winglets, and it flew around the fighters (from front to back to side, like a toddler hands around it's mother's legs). So it was not being towed.

 About 15 minutes later the three fighters returned (again heading in the same Northerly direction), but this time the little cylinder craft was gone.  .

 Problem 1: No fighter plane would (to my knowlecge) get that close to a flying missile or remotely controlled object. It was within 5 feet of the planes when parallel to them.

 Problem 2: I can't see how this was propelled. It obviously was not towed! And they were travelling 200-300 mph. A little slow for a missile. Besides there are no bombing ranges in this immediate area. They are all at China Lake (60 miles to the north).

 Problems 3: if it was remotely controlled how could it fly as such without some winglets and rudder. Of course I am aware of thrust vectoring, but this one had no exhaust. New propulsion technique?  Speculation: Since this was escorted, it was clearly military, and could be a source of similar UFO sightings and reports. For example, a friend saw a small, lone  flying tube/cigar around the canyons back in Sand Canyon in Tehachapi, CA (40 mis west of EAFB) with no visible propulsion system.

 Summary:  I wouldn't even bother to report this one, but I think it could be of interest to other parties who have seen something like this and other military craft and think of it as extraterrestrial.  The military has some pretty good stuff that is way ahead of the outdated Stealths.

 For comparison, BTW, two years ago in the winter I did see the very LARGE triangular, matte black craft early one very cloudy morning flying north out of Palmdale (Plant 42). While driving on I-14 west of Plant 42 airstrips I saw it lift up into the thick low clouds in thesky so fast I couldn't believe it!  I almost ran off the road. Clearly they wanted this thing up into the cloud cover ASAP.  NO, it was not the B-2 or tiny F-117, the large tankers, nor the C-117 (or others, which are common around here). It looked like about 2.5 times the size (or more) of the B-2 with slight upturn on the tips of the manta type wings.

Location: Eastern Kern County, near Ridgecrest, CA.

Observer Coordinates: 35deg.,35min N Lat.; 117deg.,42min W Long.

Vehicle Flight Path: Over undeveloped desert, managed by US Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

 The time was late afternoon, about 1 hour before sunset, clear visibility. The day had been blustery - moderate wind, partial cloud cover. I was inside, sitting at my computer when gunshots from a wash about 1/4 mile away diverted my attention. I gazed out my 8'W x 4'H picture window to the south to see if I could see the shooters. My house borders undeveloped BLM desert land; the view is unobstructed except for some low-lying bushes in the foreground. The desert floor slopes gently upward on an alluvial fan for about 2/3 to 3/4 mile, backed by low hills known locally as the Rademachers; a topographical map of the area indicates the crest of the nearest peak is 1.1 mile distant and 430 feet higher in elevation than my vantage point inside my house.

 I couldn't see the shooters, but after a few seconds my attention was drawn to a rapidly moving object at the right-hand-side of the window. My first thought in the first fraction of a second was that it was a bird. Quickly I realized it was not a bird, but rather some sort of aircraft. It followed a straight horizontal path - no flapping or deviation which would be typical of birds in flight. We do have soaring birds in this area, but this was obviously no soaring bird either. The object traveled from right to left (generally west to east) across my field of view defined by the window. It was low in altitude, staying below the crest of the hills at all times, so lower and closer to me than the 1.1 mile, 430 foot elevation peak mentioned earlier; but apparently near the base of the hills where they transition to the alluvial fan. So with the aid of the topo map I have been able to make a good estimate of the object's distance and elevation: I estimate it was 2/3 to 3/4 mile distant and no more than 100 - 200 feet above the terrain it was flying over.  It is unusual for an aircraft to be flying so low in that area - certainly in violation of FAA regulations.

 Since I saw only a profile view at a distance, I can't say much about the appearance of the craft. My sense is it more closely resembled a small private plane than a military jet in size and profile. But it seemed thinner in profile than a private plane. My sense is there was a vertical stabilizer at the rear; I am not very sure of that. I can make a rough guess of the length of the craft. Its angular length was no less than 1/8"", no more than 1/4"" at arm's length (30""). At an estimated distance of 3/4 mile, this would be equivalent to 16.5 to 30 feet in length for the object or about 23 feet +/-7; at 2/3 mile the estimated object length would be about 21 feet +/-6.

 Field of View: My view through the window can be determined quite accurately from the dimensions of the window and my vantage point. It is close to 36 degrees. Scaling this on the topo map yields a distance of about 2500 feet or just under half a mile that the object was in my field of view, assuming a nearly west-to-east flight path near the base of the hills.

 Duration of the sighting: This is my worst data point. It was all over in a few seconds. But was it 4 seconds, was it 8? I guess 5 to 6 seconds from when I first noticed the moving object on the west end of my window until it reached the east end. Let us assume a time of 5.5 seconds in my field of view. For a 2500 foot flight path this results in an estimated speed of 455FPS or 310MPH for the craft.

 After a short lapse (2 - 4 seconds?) I thought: ""I must get outside to see if I can see this thing continue its path."" I rushed out of the house to look toward the east (have timed it since - takes about 8 - 10 seconds). I saw no more evidence of the craft, nor was I aware of any aircraft noise in the vicinity. My biggest regret is that I didn't hurry over to see if the shooters had seen the craft. They were closer to it, and of course outside so could have heard sound during its passage. Sadly, I did not attempt to contact them.

 Observer is a retired physicist, amateur astronomer and one-time private pilot. He is a long-time resident of the area and is well aquainted with the terrain over which the craft was observed to fly. Observer has 20-20 vision when wearing corrective lenses, was wearing glasses at time of sighting.

  NOTE added 23 Sept. 2003: It wasn't until 16 Sept. 2003 while starting to document this sighting that I realized it has characteristics similar to a Tomahawk cruise missile; in other words, perhaps it was a Tomahawk at low altitude. Since the sighting occurred a short distance from the boundaries of the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS), this may not be an unreasonable hypothesis. A web search revealed several unclassified press releases of Tomahawk flight tests which have terminated at China Lake, but none were found for any time in February 2000.

Hello, my name is ((name deleted)) and I currently live in Erie, Pa, phone # 814 ((telephone number deleted)). I lived in Bisbee Arizona for about twenty years, moving to Erie in 1992. In looking for accounts of an extended sighting of an aerial object in Bisbee in, I believe, 1980, I came across ((name deleted)) account on your site of another set of sightings I am not very familiar with. I do know ((name deleted)), consider him a reliable witness and he is one of the many witnesses to the 1980 affair. This was reported, years later, 30 Nov 95, in a Bisbee newspaper in an article by their staff reporter. None of the published accounts were even remotely like what I saw and carefully noted in my mind. Doing further research and field work, I found that this reporter was known to be inaccurate- to be kind about it, and even prone to gross sensationalism, this being the likely cause of the bizarre accounts published. No intended reflection on the publisher. I didn't think to remember the date of this incident but memory serves perhaps well enough. It was not hot, just comfortable, breezy and my recall of the nature of the lighting and timing and bearing of the sunset would all together lead me to estimate the time to be late winter, early spring. The news account gives the year as 1981 but I think it had to be 1980 from my own reckoning. I don't know how to contact ((name deleted)) to verify his account in the newspaper article. I'm surprised he didn't give you folks there at Citizens Against UFO Secrecy an account of the 1980 spectacle. It was truly stunning.  ((name deleted) was quite a ways further away from it but still had a good view. I and another fella, ((name #2 deleted)), stood nearly under it for quite some time. I cautiously state that we did so for 10 minutes (no watch) though it was likely quite a bit longer. ((name #2)) and I (my first name is ((name #2 deleted)) too) were Bisbee's two leading mechanical shop owners and good observers of physical/energy realities. I had worked previously as a telemetry collector/analyst in the ASA for the NSA and so was! quite familiar with spacecraft and their capabilities, even being able to make the dubiously embarrassing claim of being a rocket scientist! This event occurred at about 6pm at ((name of fuel station deleted)) station on the Bisbee traffic circle. The object was nearly directly overhead, stationary, clearly visible!! ((name #1 deleted))  was about a mile and a half away, in South Bisbee, I seem to recall him saying that when he came upon us after the object left. We were about 150-200 yards from the Lavender Pit copper mine. I arrived from Douglas Arizona as ((name #2 deleted)) was closing his station, which he customarily did at 6pm. He and I stood for a few minutes talking, each with one foot up on the front bumper of my white 53 Chev panel truck on the station parking lot in the waning sun. I then had an odd feeling, looked about, then almost straight up and was shocked to see an object had appeared and was absolutely still above us. It was over the back of the Chevron property, overlapping onto an area called the Shady Dell. The sun was just disappearing down behind the Phelps Dodge mine track embankment, as seen from where we were standing. The object itself was in full sunlight, being higher up. My hand, at arms length, would not cover it up. There was a slight breeze. ((name #2 deleted)) then looked up to see what had me agape and was himself riveted to the sight. I finally looked over at ((name #2 deleted)) and asked him, ""Do you see what I see?!"". ((Name #2 deleted)) said ""I sure do!"" We then looked it over keenly, both of us comparing notes of our observations. We were in agreement about what we were looking at. I'm sure we both had thoughts run through our minds about whether we should leave the area immediately. We didn't feel threatened at all. It was just so extraordinarily strange to be in near company with such a thing. We had no idea what was going to happen and waited with bated breath. I, at one point, cast about looking for a stone to throw up at it to try and get a clearer sense of its height above us, and it's size. Then decided my action might seem unfriendly (stone! age savages it would appear) and for that matter the stone might come down and cause some property damage. Or some antimatter reaction. I abandoned the idea. It was a fair sized object. I thought that perhaps a low humming I was hearing might be coming from the object. We talked it over and finally decided that the slight noise was 60hz hum coming from the nearby overhead electrical wires. We had a kind of feeling about the object's presence that I can't quite describe, sort of as though there were some being up there observing and aware of us. The fact is though, we never saw any sign of such a sentient being. Just the handiwork and actions thereof. We noted that many of the cars coming around the traffic circle were slowing down, somewhat dangerously, then most accelerating vigorously on through the mine track underpass, itself nearly under the edge of the object. The cars could then be heard accelerating hard away from it onto the pit circumference highway up to Old Bisbee. Nobody stopped although they could be seen leaning down and forward briefly trying to get a better look. I think a lot of those people wished they hadn't seen it, my judging their reactions as they exited the area. I remember pinching myself and slapping myself, almost jokingly, to make sure I wasn't dreaming. In fairness, I should now describe the object though there is little to be said even though it was likely within a stones throw of us. It was an oblate spheroid. In more common terms, it was like a flattened or squashed sphere. From the top or bottom it would appear to be perfectly round or circular. From the side aspect it had kind of a horizontal football shape except the ends weren't pointed but instead gently rounded. It appeared to have curvilinear symmetry above and below the arbitrary ?belt line?. It did not revolve or move whatsoever in the gently gusting breeze. It appeared to be made of stainless steel or perhaps aluminum or titanium or beryllium with a finely brushed matte finish. The disturbing thing, to a couple! of good physical observers as us two ((name #2 deleted)), was that the thing was absolutely perfect. There were no seams, slight irregularities or distortions, plates, rivets or any other deviations from it's monolithic perfection. The nearest thing that I can call up from our technologies would be a metallic balloon somehow squashed into the oblate spheroid shape. This would have stress lines and wrinkles though. It could not possibly be perfect, as this was. It would also be bobbling in the breeze. As I stated, this object was rock steady. As well, our observer sense of it was that it was hard bodied. We peered intensely at it for a long time. It was not hard to see at all, the object was nearby in full late afternoon sunlight. Atmospheric conditions, late afternoon, were good, with some slight shadowing on the object on the side away from the sun. There was no significant cloud cover other than a little bit of scuddy, stringy stuff.  We were not in a position to see where the sun angle would have thrown the objects shadow, unfortunately. That would have been an astute observation to make. I also did not attempt to walk directly under it, which would have given us a good lateral distance and from that a better guess at height off the ground and, of course it's size. We were a little too awed, I think, to put that plan in motion, thinking that something could happen at any moment, though I thought it out at the time as I tried to estimate those parameters. Making this process even more nebulous was the fact that the object had absolutely no features except for it's shape, color and finish appearance. There were no rivets, as I said, no seams, plates, ports, lights, hatches, vents, doors, windows, antennas, pitot tubes...nada. Featureless. ((name #2 deleted)) and I both discussed this back and forth as we carefully looked it over. Nothing. Nothing by which one might then judge it's size, distance and nature. It couldn't have sat up there any stiller than it did. After quite some passage of time, it suddenly did a small maneuver, ! almost comical, like the wobble of a top as it spins down. I would relate this as being a precessional wobble as of the physics of a gyroscope spinning down through it?s structural harmonics and beginning to lose it's stability. The object wasn't spinning though, just wobbling. It was over in about three seconds, a couple of wobbles, and was instantly and fluidly moving quite steadily in the direction of the copper pit at about 10-12 miles an hour for the first hundred or so feet, which took it out of our line of sight behind the ridged embankment which carried tracks for the copper operation. It then appeared to us, visible over the tracks, in the direction and going in the direction it had originally disappeared in, approximately a mile away and going fast. It was now proceeding upwards at a steep angle at probably a thousand miles an hour, clearing the mountain containing the Queen Mine next to old Bisbee, and proceeding straight on out of sight at that angle, roughly in the direction of the setting sun. Surprisingly, considering the great speed it was now moving at, it still made absolutely no sound. These movements gave some hint as to the elevation of the object and it's size though not too reliably so. I would then estimate that it had been stationary over our heads at about 250 feet and was probably 80 to 100 feet in diameter and about 35-40 feet in height or thickness. ((name #2 deleted)) and I were surprisingly tired out by the experience and could conclude little other than what I have related. No little green men. We don't know what we saw. But we know what we saw. Paradox. It was nothing that our technologies could do then or even now unless it was an extremely realistic hologram projected from a satellite in space, as in Ronald Raygun's space based missile defense technology projects or something of that nature. I don't think so. Whatever it was, I don't think man had any thing to do with it. My memory is a little fuzzy about this but possibly ((name #2 deleted)) wife arrived at which point ((name #3 deleted)), ((name #4 deleted)) and a friend of theirs drove up, greatly excited. I can't remember the details of what they said they saw but I'm sure it wasn't what was reported in the Bisbee news 15 years later. I then left, heading out down the pit highway towards Old Bisbee. I had gotten only through the mine track underpass, through the first S turn and was just straightening out towards Bisbee Blue when I heard a tremendous, shattering roar, echoing wildly about. It kind of scared me, I hunkered down in the seat of my old truck and looked out the window to see the second astonishment of the day. A jet fighter plane on flaming afterburner, flying an extremely risque trajectory from over Warren out over the pit, to my left not a hundred feet above my elevation, going in the same direction and flight path the object had a couple of minutes before. This aircraft actually had to bank hard left to miss Sacramento hill, or what's left of it on the edge of the pit, then hard right back on track followed immediately by a hard pull up to clear Copper Queen mountain. It following the path the object had, moments previous. Obviously in pursuit. Our government knows about these things. Who is kidding who here. Breathtaking.

I was walking by myself when I saw this object. Whatever I saw, it was pretty big. I'd say atleast five times the size of any light beacons on the towers near my home. It traveled from NE to SW at a very high speed, was a very light fluorescent blue in color, and left a trail behind it. I'm not sure how long it was actually visible because there were some trees obstructing my view. I may have just seen the tail end of this objects flight path. The night sky was extremely clear and I also noticed alot more air traffic than usual. I want to say the tip of it was rounded, almost like a roundnose pistol bullet. I'm pretty sure it wasn't a meteor. I am not an expert on these things, but I can definitely say I've never seen anything like this before.

I was a patrol agent in charge on both Canadian and Mexican borders for last 20 years of my career.  I was also a special agent for a time in San Francisco with the Office of Insector General, USDA.  I worked as head of intelligence unit for the Border Patrol, working as liaison officer with RCMP in Canada. I am not a flake.  I have had a couple of UFO sightings myself and have known several people over the past 40 years, many in law enforcement in different parts of the country who have told me credible UFO stories that they experienced.  I reported most of these to MUFON several years ago and in 1977 I was contacted in Indio, California where I was agent in charge of that station about a UFO sighting there.

 The UFO sighting that I refer to above was reported in the San Diego Union-Tribune and I contacted the reporter/columnist about what I saw after I read his story.  He plead with people who may have seen what he saw to call in or write him.  I called him and told him who I was and what I had seen.  He wanted me to go on the local TV station in San Diego and confirm what he had sighted as he felt I was the most credible of the 45 witnesses who had called him.  Another Border Patrol supervisor confirmed that he had seen the same UFO as he departed his apartment in East San Diego to come to work.  When I asked permission from my chief patrol agent to go onthe TV show I was told, ""you are not going to make the Border Patrol look like a bunch of nuts...permission denied.""  The other supervisor acknowledged in front of the chief that he had seen it, also.  But when the chief made his statement to me, the other supervisor said, ""I am out of here...don't include me in this.""  What I saw and described, and drew a diagram of, and can still vividly remember it and am able to draw a diagram, was a light that was travelling along a ridge along highway 94 as I drove west on that highway in the Tecate area.  I was going to San Ysidro to go to work at the Border Patrol sector HQ.  I was stationed and in charge of the Campo BP station at the time but had been detailed to work at the HQ for a month to fill in for a vacationing asst chief.  I had to negotiate highway 94 and try to watch the object at the same time.  But it must have moved along the mountain tops in what I thought was the Jamul area.  I was looking west towards SD and I saw a heavy bank of low clouds or fog which was not unusual in the early morning as one approached SD.  The light moved from behind the cloud bank and it had a conical beam that was extremely bright.  I thought at first it was one of our helicopters that was searching the ridge for illegal aliens in that arae.  But I found out that none of our helicopters were out at that time of the morning.  The beam was just too bright for a helicopter light and it could shine through the clouds almost as brightly as in front of them.

 I watched the light, and negotiated the highway, which is very curvy in that area, and I had to take my eyes off it from time to time.  The strange part was when I got to the bottom of highway 94 at Barrett Junction, i started back up the hill to the ridge where I thought the light had come from.  It was gone at that time.  I was very surprised when I topped the ridge in the Dulzura area, that there was no cloud bank and no fog.  It was very clear that morning and the city lights from San Diego could be seen plainly.  The incident went out of my mind until I read the newpaper article a couple of days later.

 The reporter told me, and wrote in the paper also, that there were 45 people who called him and reported almost the same thing as we had seen.  The other BP supv also confirmed that was what he saw, too, but he saw it further out to the west, probably over the ocean.  Some people who called the reporter were jogging on the beach and they saw it over the ocean and said there was a small airplane moving towards SD from the west over the sea and the UFO swallowed the plane in it's beam.  There was no official confirmation from the Navy or any govt agency.

 The one incident that I reported to MUFON...and my report should be on file with them from back around 1977 was something told to me.  This is a really wierd story but I believe it.

 In 1977 there was a story that came to me through a BP agent at my station in Indio that one of his classmates stationed at Alamogordo BP station (White Sands) had gotten into some real trouble.  It seems that he and another agent went onto the missile range that was south of Alamogordo.  I think it is called the McGregor missile range.

 Anyway, as it was reported to me, the two agents drove quite a ways down the range in their 4 wheel drive vehicle which they were not supposed to do.  If there were illgals walking up from the El Paso area, it was customary for the Air Police to pick them up and bring them out of the restricted area to the BP.  So, the guys were just going down to scope out the area and track aliens if there were any walking in the area.

 Quite a ways into the restricted area, they spotted what they thought was a small cone shaped mountain which looked strange to them.  It looked like a small volcano cone, as they described it.  They reportedly parked there vehicle and climbed up the cone shaped mountain which wasn't too high, but I was not told how high it was.  When they got to the top they could look down into the crater part and saw a flying saucer parked in the bottom being attended by Air Force personnel.  They apparently realized they were seeing something they shouldn't and they crept back down the hill and got out of the area.

 AFter work, that afternoon the two agents are reported to have met some other agents and people in a local tavern where they guys hung out, and after a couple of beers they started telling the others what they had seen in the restricted area.  AS the story goes, it was not very long when a couple of men in ""black suits"" showed up, showed their IDs and requested the two agents accompany them, to what is assumed an office at White Sands base.

 As the story goes, they were debriefed, their agent in charge of the station was called in, and the two were immediately transferred to other duties with a day, and admonished in strong terms not to tell what they had seen.

 The agent in charge of the station was an very old friend of mine whom I worked with as partners in Carlsbad, NM for 5 years.  He passed away of cancer last year.  I called him on the phone and relayed the story as I had heard it and asked him if it was true.  We were using a government phone line.  He was an ex-Marine, very patriotic person, and the way in which he answered me led me to believe that it was true.  In a very measured voice he replied, ""Don't know anything about it...never happened.""  And he made no further comment.  He left me to believe that he would not discuss the subject any further.

 Some years later, after I had retired, another retired agent in charge and I stopped by this retired agent's home in Alamogordo.  This was in about 1995.  We were having a couple of drinks and I reminded him of the call I had made to him about the UFO incident in 1977.  I asked him if he remembered my call.  He said he did.  I then asked him again...""We are all retired now, you can tell me the truth about the UFO thing.""  He looked at me, and in almost identical words and same measured tone, ""Don't know anything about it...never happened.""  That told me that he definitely knew and that he had been sworn to secrecy never to tell..probably by the people at White Sands.  His ex-wife was a long time government employee, a secretary and she worked at White Sands.  So there were reasons that he could not talk.  He was the kind of person, had he been sworn to secrecy about a national security issue, he would take it to his grave...which he did.  But he let me know in his answer that it happened.  That was my take on it.

 The investigator from MUFON was very interested in that story alone.  He didn't seem to be interested in any of the other things that I had seen or had relayed to me.

 When I was stationed in Carlsbad, NM in the early sixties there were UFO stories all over the place.  There were some vivid sightings by state policemen.  One, who was station at Alamogordo even took out his accident investigation camera and took photos of a flying saucer that had landed off the highway early in the morning, only to have the men in black suits from White Sands confiscate his film.  He personally told me about that incident.  That happened in about 1962 or thereabouts.

 I heard about another incident involving a state police officer driving north of White Sands when his car went dead.  Everything electrical on it went dead, according to him...no radio no anything.  He got out and walked a little down the highway and every other vehicle was dead along side the highway also.

 He walked back to his patrol car, got in and after a few minutes everything came back on and all the other cars were starting up a moving.  He said that someone told him that they were conducting some kind of experiments at White Sands but he couldn[t find out exactly what it was.

 Strangely enough, part of our working area out of Carlsbad was Roswell and the ranch area to the west.  We contacted the air police people at the air base there which was still a SAC base and we never heard a word about the July, 1947 incident during that time.  But there were some other strange things that went on around the SAC base in those days.

 In about 1964 my partner and I were driving up to Clovis, NM to pick up some aliens that were in custody.  We had left Carlsbad abou 4am because it was a long round trip drive.  We passed through Roswell while it was still dark, and as we turned on to the highway to Portales, about 2 miles up the highway we ran into a state police roadblock.  There were two state police officers that we knew and they stopped us.  As I remember we were the only car stopped there.  They came over, and I was driving.  My partner (the same man who was in Alamogordo in 1977 that said ""never happened"") was working with me.  We asked what was going on because there were helicopters flying over the sand hills there, and jeeps moving all around on the sand dunes.  They had spot lights and were obviously looking for something.

 The state police said, since we were federal officers and had security clearances, they could tell us what was going on.  They said that the Air Force people told them that one of the Atlas missiles in a silo (there were about 20 missile silos that ringed the base and Roswell) had ""accidentally"" been fired and it had a nuclear warhead on it.  They said they were told the missile was able to rip through part of the covering steel and concete doors on the silo, and that the nuclear warhead had flown off it and landed somewhere in the area and they were frantic because they could not find it.

 After we sat there for a few minutes, they finally told us to drive on through since we were in a marked patrol vehicle, and we did.  We were warned if we saw anything laying in the road not to get near it.  We drove through, seeing all kinds of AF vehicles prowling over the sand dunes with search lights, and drove on to Portales and Clovis.

 About a month later we saw one of the same state policemen in their Roswell office and remembered the missile incident.  We asked him what had happened.  He said that the AF told them that they had located the warhead somewhere back east...I think Cleveland.  they said that an old Indian was dying in a hospital from radiation poisoning.  The AF people said that they figured someone had stopped and picked up the warhead when it landed in the highway, put it in their car and drove away with it. They said that is what the old Indian told them.  He had seen it on the highway, stopped and put it in the trunk of his car and drove to Cleveland, getting sick about two weeks later.

 The story didn't really make much sense to us but that was what the AF said.  We also heard that one other silo had been blown up by and accidental missile shooting in it.  I recently heard some retired AF captain or something talking about how the missile silos (around Roswell, I believe) were harrassed by UFOs and there had been some major accidents in the silos caused by the UFOs.  I always wondered if that wasn't what really happened that morning and that the AF gave a cover story about the warhead being stolen by and old Indian.

 It was strange because had an Atlas missile been shot off in a silo, the crew in the control room down under would have been killed or something.  We never heard a word about anything like that.  It was a very strange incident that has always stuck in my mind.

 There are other stories that I have heard over the years from other officers, but am getting writers cramps right now.

 I enjoyed hearing you on the radio tonight as on occasions before.  Keep up the good work.  I will bet that your job is fascinating.

We were both staring at the same patch of sky high over the horizon when a sudden flare of light attracted our attention directly west. It suddenly grew in brilliance/size, a orange/bronze color, faded slightly, then grew again. It did not change location. Although their were military jets in the vicinity early in the day because of 9/11, being ex-military, I know what we saw was not afterburners or military style anti heat-seeking missile flares. By the time we went for our video camera the light was gone. Turning on the police scanner, there was some traffic regarding military activity in the area, but with no details.

On this date, I was putting wood in my woodstove, which is located in my den. The den has a window which is level with the front yard. The ground was covered with snow, about an inch, maybe a bit more. As I was putting the wood in, I noticed the whole front yard was red. Assuming my chimminey was on fire, I ran upstairs and went to the deck which is located in the back of the house. As I went past my mother, which at that time was living with my wife and I, I told her, ""I think my chimminey is on fire!"" Once I opened the sliding door which leads to the deck, she was behind me. As I looked outside, the whole back yard was bright red. Looking toward the chimminey I realized it was not on fire. I looked around and saw a bright red round object over my backyard. It looked like a red spotlight, but big. I would say it was about 100 yards above the backyard. The exact size is hard to decribe due to the brightness of the light, as if looking into a spotlight. But it was bigger than, let's say, a full size van. It hovered there for a few seconds and shot straight up, faster then anything I have ever seen, a loud boom followed and it disappeared going up. It disappeared in less than a second or two. Being ex-U.S. Army, a Sgt (E-5) with the 82nd ABN, two combat tours, I know it was not a military plane or helicopter. The boom, it is my opinion was the sound barrier being broken due to the speed it went up. I have seen many weapons and planes/helicopters in action, I have seen F-15's and F-16's fly over my head low, but nothing will compare to how fast this object shot straight up, even faster than missiles being shot from a MRLS vehicle. The speed was undescribable. One curious thing is that it did not emit any sound, as in a motor running, only the boom as it went up. My next door neighbor came out to his deck and yelled at me, ""Did you shoot a shotgun?!"" I told him no, I didn't but had heard a noise, not figuring he would understand what I had just seen. My mother saw the object also. I know it ! was not a military plane.

I am not sure about the exact date, but I am sure it was around December of '93.

My brother.

At a family gathering in the early 1960s when my brother, who served in a special part of the armed forces, revealed that the military was fully aware of the existence of UFOS. My brother, now deceased, had worked in what he described as ""missile guidance systems"" He told us, as part of the schooling, he and about 30 others received special training in reading radar and being able to identify UFOs from other aircraft.  He said the military did not want an accidental nuclear exchange as a result of confusing UFOs with possible missile launchings from the People?s Republic of China or the Soviet Union. He told also told us that during Cuban missile crisis he spent 2 weeks in a deep underground missile complex waiting for orders that might lead to world war 3.

The army, he said, not only revealed UFO existence but also trained him and the others of his crew in how recognize their peculiar movements and characteristics on radar. The military, he told us revealed nothing more other then they were just here.

My secretary.

In 1978 I hired a 70-year-old woman named ((namd deleted)), as my secretary. I was director of an organization that planned and created activities for older Americans. ((name deleted)) told me when she was a young woman in her early 20s (around 1928) and living in the state of Wyoming, she used to get up early in the morning 2 or 3 times a week and play golf. She recounted one very early summer morning just after 4:30 am she walked about a quarter of a mile to the golf course. When she reached the top off a small hill overlooking the playing area, she said she was stunned to see a greenish glowing sphere-like object setting about 10 feet off the ground. She told me she was so shocked that had she could not move. She described it as being approximately 50 feet in diameter with oval shaped windows around the top third area.  She said she knew instinctively it was not from our world.  After nearly 10 minutes of just staring at this most unusual sight she said the object rose slowly from its position and began making a faint humming noise. Then quite suddenly it just streaked away and was gone with in a few seconds. She never told anyone about this for 25 years for fear people would think she was crazy. I believed this ((name deleted))?s story because she always told me the truth. If she did not like how I was running the Agency she would tell me about it and not always pleasantly.  She was a no-nonsense person who believed neither in God, nor honest politicians.

The airline pilot: For a few months in 1980 I worked at a car rental agency. One of my duties was to go to the Seattle International airport and pick up airline flight crew and bring them back for a car rental. Every time I picked up a pilot I would always find some way of asking them if they had ever seen a UFO. Every pilot but two replied no. I felt some were even irritated with the question but most were good sports and gave me their opinion (usually negative) on the subject. A few told me while they did not believe in them, other airline pilot friends did report seeing them on occasion.

One evening I picked up an airline pilot captain whose name was Frank. When I asked Frank if he had ever seen anything strange like a UFO, he was very silent for a few minutes. I thought maybe he was insulted by the question. I was worried he would tell my boss. However, to my surprise he opened up and told a very interesting story.

During the Carter administration, I was flying out of Washington DC with not only the regulars (passengers) but I had the Secretary of Transportation, and his staff on board.  We were about 20 miles out when three green globes or spheres appeared in front of my plane.  He said they appeared to be about 50 feet or better in diameter and were flying formation.  We not only had visual, but they were being tracked from ground radar.  He told me; because these objects were in front of the plane none of the passengers were aware of what was going on.

I called the Secretary of transportation to my cockpit. I wanted a witness and I thought he would want to know. I thought this would be the biggest news story of the century. I asked him if they might have been experimental craft. He said flatly; ""No"" He said there were oval shaped windows or what appeared to be windows around the top third of the sphere. ""Not one of my flight crew nor did the secretary of transportation think they were other then what they appeared to be, some kind of space craft from another world.

I found it remarkable that the type of craft described by both ((name deleted)) and the Airline pilot were identical even thought the two events took place more then 30 years apart.

I wrote this report becuase I thought it was my public duty. If you care to print it or just keep it on record is fine either way with me. Thank you.

I had been sitting on the front porch here in Abilene, Texas, in July of 95, with my wife and one of my employees, enjoying a pleasant conversation, when I decided to walk out to the end of our sidewalk to stretch my back and legs, leaving them chatting on the couch on the front porch.

Once I reached the end of the sidewalk, I looked up and noticed how bright and beautiful the stars were, so, it being such a nice, warm summer evening, I decided to lay on my back on the end of the sidewalk, and to watch the stars for awhile.

After laying there for only a few minutes, I thought I saw something move out of the corner of my eye, up in the sky, perhaps a shooting star, so I moved my gaze over to where I thought I saw it.   After only a few seconds, I saw a ""star"" suddenly start to move in a very birarre pattern, in an area about the size of a silver dollar, held at arm's length.  It moved within that area for about 10 to 30 seconds, then stopped.   When I looked away from it, and then looked back, it looked so much like any other star, that I could not differentiate it from any other star I had been seeing, so much so that I couldn't even tell if I was looking at the object that had moved, or if I was seeing a star.

When the ""star"" moved, it did not accelerate the way everything else I had ever seen had; and when it came to a stop, it did not slowly decelerate, either.  When it moved, it was instantly going full speed, and when it stopped, it just stopped.  There was no speeding up or slowing down.  It was either moving at full speed, or it wasn't.   And when it turned or changed direction, it did not do so with a curving movement; it just suddenly changed directions, often changing it's direction of movement 45, 90, even 180 degrees, going back the direction it had come from! After performing these ""movements"" for 30 seconds or so, it would stop for about that same length of time, and then start moving again.

After seeing that happen a couple of times, the reality of what I was seeing, that I was definately seeing a genuine UFO, so overwhelmed me, that I actually wondered if I was losing my mind!  So much so that it actually scared me! I needed someone else to tell me if they were seeing this too, so I got up and, unbelievably calmly and quietly asked my wife if she would mind walking out to the end of the sidewalk with me.   She did, and when we got to the end of the walk, I turned my back to where Pete was up on the porch, 40 feet away, and told her, ""Honey, I want to ask you something, and when you answer me, no matter what you have to say or how you feel, I want you to WHISPER your answer to me, and I don't want you to make ANY kind of movements with your arms or hands, or even your head, that Pete can see from up there on the porch.  In fact, I am going to stand with my body between you and Pete, and if you have any pointing to do, be sure my body is between the two of you so that he cannot see you. (I am a full head taller than her, and wider.)  Do you understand?"" She said yes, so without looking up or pointing, I told her, ""I want you to look up into the sky, where the stars are, right directly above my head, but do it very casually to where Pete won't notice, and I want you to tell me if you see anything unusual, but remember!  Do not SAY or do anything that Pete could hear or see."" I stood very, very close to her, doing my best to block Pete's view of her, and she began to search the sky above us.  After about 20 seconds she started to say, ""Honey, I don't know what you're wanting me to see, cause I'm not seeing anything..."", and just as the last word was leaving her mouth, I saw her eyes get big, and a very excited, stunned look come on her face, and knew she had seen it too, so I very quickly whispered, ""shhhhh! Don't say it! Whisper it in my ear!"" I leaned over and put my ear close to her mouth, and she whispered, with trembling and excitement in her voice:  ""A star!  There's a STAR moving around in a very weird way!  It's zipping around, changing directions, and not speeding up or slowing down!""  I told her, ""take my hand, and with your finger, trace out the pattern that it is making.""  And she drew the exact patterns on my hand that I had seen the ""star"" make.

With great relief, having been reassured that I was not going insane, I whispered ""thank you"" to her, and told her that I was going to call Pete out and go through the same thing with him, and for her to be very careful not to give him any verbal or visual ques whatsoever as to what we had seen, or what we wanted him to look for.

To make a long story short, I repeated this same ""test"" with Pete, and he too, went through almost the same exact stages that my wife had gone through; at first not seeing anything, and then the sudden realization that he, too, was seeing something like nothing else he had ever seen in his life! We watched that object for a couple of hours, as it performed ""maneuvers"" in a certain area of the sky, about the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length, and then, after doing that for several minutes, it would suddenly make a ""long jump"" over to another part of the sky, where it would repeat the same or similar maneuvers that we had seen it do, in the location it had just left.

We all feel absolutely sure that this object was a long ways outside of any atmosphere surrounding our planet, and while it certainly appeared to actually be as far away as the stars themselves, especially when the objected stopped, I realize it was probably actually between the earth and the stars, probably far closer to earth, than to the stars, although when the craft stood still, it looked so much like all the stars, that there was NO way you could tell if you were looking at a star, or at the craft!  (I have a feeling that this was deliberate on the part of ""some body!"") We watched it for perhaps two hours, during which time it slowly made it's way from almost straight overhead, to towards the southeast.  (My wife says it moved towards the southWEST.)  We watched it for so long that we could no longer stay awake, having all of us put in a hard work week, and seeing that it was apparently going to do nothing but continue what we had been seeing it do for the past two or three hours, my wife and I went in and to bed, and Pete went home.   Even now, years later, we still sometimes watch for it to reappear, as we are sure and hope that it will.

Since then, I visit endless websites and listen to Coast To Coast AM and other programs almost every single day, hoping to hear about others who have seen a similar object, and every now and then, I do!   In fact, I read of someone seeing what is apparently the same exact object, only YESTERDAY, October 16, 2003, on the National UFO Reporting website, and so I felt prompted to also post my report of this similar sighting.

In conclusion, I'd like for it to be known that I am 50 years old, that I was born on an Air Force Base, that I have been a student pilot, and have attended dozens of air shows, and have watched many television programs about air craft, but I have never, ever seen anything that could even remotely do the kinds of things that this craft did!   Unless the pilot of the vehicle had some kind of survival gear light years ahead of anything we have now, there is no way a human could have survived the instantaneous application of g-forces that were obviously applied to the body of the vessel's pilot, (if it even had one!)   And obviously, the craft itself had to be light years ahead of anything we have now.

Having been a communications technician, and always being strongly interested in these kinds of things, I would dearly love to have the opportunity to work with, and hopefully even to take a ride in, one of these vehicles, some day! PS: Abilene is the home of Dyess Air Force Base, the home of the B1 bomber, and this incident happened about 3 miles from the base, but over East Abilene, not over the base.  I have, however, since seen a missile like object, during the ""Gulf War,"" take off from the area north of Dyess, go apparently to the edge of the atmosphere, and arc over, then to head east towards the general direction of the Middle East.

 A mysterious long UFO seen as a row six very bright amber lights has appeared over the west central Missouri region over several nights in September and October in 2003.   The UFO was reported by farmers, factory workers and commuters that consisted of either seeing the object hovering over the pastures off the side of the road or moving over the trees in dense woods.

 So far there hasn?t been any report of unusual animal deaths or close encounters associated with the UFO sightings.  However, there has been a recently reported corn field crop formation that was reported on October 4th where this UFO did appear over is currently under investigation.

 It began on the evening of September 6th with a couple of Pleasant Hill, MO area residents driving up over a small hill on a rural road then stopped to watch a strange row of bright lights hovering over a field between Harrisonville and Pleasant Hill.  I called Amber C. the girlfriend who witnessed this UFO.  Amber told me the UFO was lit up with six very bright amber lights that made it hard to determine any real shape of the craft. But after observing it for only a few moments the UFO lights suddenly went out and no object was seen at all in the dark sky.  Amber said they didn?t hear any sounds by the UFO at any time.  The weather was clear and warm.

 On the evening of September 9th Rick D. was driving back home to Independence from his farm in Shawnee Mound on Highway 13 in northern Henry County near the Johnson County line.  Rick noticed some bright amber lights in the direction he was traveling believing that there was an accident ahead on the highway.

 Coming around a curve expecting to see emergency vehicles Rick instead saw something quite strange instead.  Cars were parked on both sides of the highway so he slowed down to see why.  Through the windshield Rick saw hovering over the east side of the road two parallel sets of six bright lights that each arched slightly over the trees near an abandoned gas station.  No sounds were heard coming from the UFO outside by Rick at any time.

 Rick realized that the other drivers had stopped just to watch these lights in the sky.  A small gap between the sets of lights was noticed but Rick said he couldn?t see any structure at all because of the bright lights.   Rick then attempted to take a photo of the UFO through the passenger side window as he got closer.  (The film was developed a day later and it only showed a faint ball of one of the UFO lights through the window. Rick?s camera?s flash was unfortunately on and it obscured most of the UFO lights outside revealing mostly the interior of his vehicle.)  Suddenly the UFO lights blinked out and nothing else was seen in the except for the full moon rising up in the clear sky.  Rick wanted to stop and find out what the other drivers thought about the UFO but they all began to drive away in both directions. Rick said at least twenty cars had pulled over but he thought it was strange that nobody stayed after the UFO was gone.  So he drove on home while listening to a nearby Warrensburg radio station?s talk show hoping somebody would mention the UFO sighting.  But nobody called and no news about it was reported.

 The next evening on September 10th in Clinton, MO at 10 pm Edwin S. reported that he observed a strange ball of yellow light the size of a dime at arms length that was very low to the northeast at 10 pm while letting his dog outside. The UFO moved to the north before getting lost in the trees.  Edwin called the Clinton Police Department but there were no other reports of this object.

 In Windsor, MO in northeast Henry County is where a factory worker named Logan M. was out on a break on the factory parking lot just after midnight on September 11th. While in his truck with a buddy the two noticed a very bright light moving very low above the trees to the south.  Assuming it was a plane or helicopter coming in their direction it was apparent that it wasn?t a normal aircraft approaching.  I spoke to Logan and he told me that the light began to move slowly towards them in a northerly direction but it didn?t make any sound at all.

 The silent UFO really impressed them Logan said and as they watched it flew virtually overhead. Underneath the UFO it had two yellow lights at each apex with a much larger yellow light in the middle that Logan called a dome. (see attached drawing of the UFO by Logan).  The UFO continued over Windsor but turned in a SW direction soon disappearing behind trees.

 Later that night at the factory Logan said that his buddy told him while he was outside taking trash out to the dumpster in the rear parking lot he saw the same UFO lights appear again. The next day Logan met another factory worker who said his girlfriend mentioned that she saw the UFO. The girlfriend called to see if the Henry County Sheriff?s office had any sightings reported.  The Sheriff?s office in Windsor did say that they got dozens of other calls that evening.  They reported   seeing a strange lighted aircraft flying over the town but the Sheriff?s office told them that everything was okay.

 In our interview Logan said that this was not a B-2 Stealth Bomber or a military helicopter at all.  Living just ten miles south of the home base B-2 called the 509th bomber squadron Logan said that everybody has seen and heard the B-2?s flying by in their takeoff and landing patterns numerous times.  ?The B-2?s are loud and they have normal flashing and landing lights.  This (UFO) thing didn?t at all.  It was very strange.  Obviously, the other witnesses felt the same way as I did after seeing this thing.?  Then on September 23rd in central Missouri two strange but separate sightings about a half hour apart were reported by the witnesses seeing a similar looking UFO near their homes.

 Around 9:00 pm a semi-retired cattle farmer named Jerry C. was driving home on a rural road in western Iron County near Boss, MO.  While going up a hill Jerry suddenly saw six very bright amber lights in a straight row appear just above the woods on the north side of the road.  The lights were hovering and not blinking at all but were the size of soccer balls.  To get a better view Jerry said that he stopped and as he began to back up the lights immediately went out.

 At 65 years old Jerry said that he never has seen anything like this before.  His stock dog was riding in the bed of the pickup truck.  Jerry said that the dog seemed to be very nervous and scared.  Jerry emailed me a couple of days later saying that he was out cutting some firewood on a ridge and when he was finished noticed his dog had disappeared.  ?The dog is always at my side and doesn?t chase my cattle. So I looked around and found the dog had been hit by a car.  It was suffering and I had to put a bullet in him.  Funny thing is that this is the exact spot on the road where we saw the UFO.  Weird isn?t it??  Then at 9:30 pm Daniel K. and his mother were inside their home watching TV on the north side of Cuba, MO or about fifty miles north of Jerry?s farm.  Daniel?s mom then noticed a strange lighted object through a window moving above the trees.  She and Daniel saw five horizontal lights for a few seconds appear to the south of their backyard.  They ran out to the back porch to see what it was but the lights went out.  Suddenly the lights appeared again to the southwest but then the lights turned off again. There was no sound of an aircraft heard at all.

 I called Daniel?s home and spoke with his mother about their sighting report.  She estimated that the lights were four and a half miles away because a main road called Highway F is about that far from their home.  She said that they?re surrounded by thick woods so it was difficult to see because the UFO was flying low just above the tree tops.  She said Daniel did call the Cuba Police Department to see if anyone else had reported seeing the strange lights in the sky but there was none.

 Another weird report came in from the Pleasant Hill area on October 10th.  James H. said that a week earlier his brother-in-law found a strange crop formation while harvesting a corn field on Saturday morning October 4th.  While up high inside the cab of the combine the brother in-law saw that the corn stalks had been cut down at ground level in a perfectly square area he said was 10 by 10 feet.  He got inside the formation and noticed that the cobs or ears of corn had been removed from the cut stalks and then pressed down into the soil with the cobs standing in a pattern.  It looked like an 8 with a small line or a 1 at the side of the 8.

 But unfortunately instead of going around the formation the brother in-law drove the combine through it. The brother in-law told James he even got off of the combine to pick up the cobs stuck in the ground and put them into the combine.  However, the brother in-law did notice that the cobs hadn?t spoiled so whatever did cause the formation happened recently.

 Nobody has been into the corn field since to check for any evidence afterwards because of the area in question is several hundred yards from any road plus recent rains has made the ground very soft so it?s inaccessible even by 4 wheel drive.  Hopefully later this fall a visit will be successfully made to the crop formation spot to gather samples.

 Now what is interesting to this crop formation and the September 6th Pleasant Hill sighting is that this corn field is exactly where the witnesses observed the UFO hovering over that evening.  The rural road the witnesses were on called Christmas Tree Lane is the south property line of the corn field just east of Highway 7.  They saw their UFO on the north side of the road over the corn field.

 It?s still possible that there are other witnesses in the area who may have seen this UFO as well but they have decided to not report their sighting or mention it to anyone.  The Missouri Investigators Group (UFOMIG.com) will continue to pursue additional witnesses and do follow-up investigation on these UFO reports.

 Updated: I'm tonight (Nov. 8th) just reading the recent sightings over Missouri the first week of November, 2003.  On Nov. 4th, 2 more UFO reports having a straight row of 3-6 very bright amber lights seen over Elisnore and Greenville and on Nov. 5 a UFO seen over St. Joe similar to the Windsor, MO craft.  I'm also reading about similar sightings of these UFOs reported seen over Pass Christian, MS and Alexandria, VA on Nov. 5th also over Kittery, ME on Nov. 6th.  Besides these reportts there were more similar UFOs seen over Arkansas and Kansas during Sept. 2003.

Shortly after moving into our new home we noticed, while moving around inside our home, my wife and I would catch a glimpse from the corner of our eyes, outside the picture window a bright flash of light, coming from the back yard.We asked each other,did you see that? wondering what it was, it only lasted for a second. This happened for approximately eight days,and always in the evening beginning around 9:00PM.This would happen only once a night (that we knew of) and not every night.The light was so bright it would light up the entire picture window like day light, in a flash we would turn our heads to look and it was gone.

One night(within the eight day period)I was sitting out on our pool deck,it was about 12 midnight,when this circular object rose above the horizon about 30 degrees, without any noise it approached very slowly above my head about 11:00, a             (70 degree angle)when it stopped and hovered.It looked like the full moon only half the size, no glow just a yellow/white circle. I watched it as it appeared to stay still watching me. Before my eyes this thing exploded without any noise, concentric rings of light blasted away from this circle lighting up thr entire back yard. It was so bright you could see the veins in the tree leaves. In less then a second out from the center of this object a missile shaped object shot out and moved at an extremely high rate of speed away on a near 80 degree angle up into the stars, about five seconds it was among the stars still moving as it vanished out of sight.

I was driving home from work shortly after 7 a.m., and witnessed a strange object.  It caught my eye because it looked like a short contrail very high up in the sky, but was really bright white.  Then as I watched, the ""trail"" became increasingly long and bright.  It was traveling from N/NW to S/SE, away from the Strait of Juan de Fuca towards the Olympic Mountains.  At this point, I pulled my car over to observe it more closely.  There were a few other cars pulled over as well, with the people inside craning their necks like I was.  By this point the ""tail"" was getting longer, and appeared to grow longer as the object made its way across the sky.  It seemed to travel like a missile, on a steady course, but with this tail behind it that was absolutely stunning.  The tail was brilliant orange by this point, and seemed to sparkle and wave, almost gossamer in appearance. This continued on for a few more minutes as it proceeded on course towards the mountains, and then disappeared from my view.

 When I got home to my husband and described what I had just seen, he said ""that must have been a solar sail.""  From his description of what that is supposed to look like I agreed, but cannot find anything on the internet about a solar sail having been launched on or near that date.  Perhaps this was a fireball or meteor?  Whatever it was, it was absolutely incredible and I'll be shocked if no one else from the area reports it (I've heard nothing yet).

It was a newer small suburban neighborhood surrounded by corn and soybean fields. Every evening before sunset I would walk my small white dog, Fritz, around the school playground and let him off the leash.  One evening before sunset during warm weather (I do not remember the month, day, or year) I had an encounter with a UFO while Fritz and I were walking up the school driveway on our way home. Three young boys on bicycles were approaching me across a grassy path to the school.  They were pointing over my head and shouting loudly. I looked up and saw hovering directly over my head at about two story roof height three lights in a triangular pattern. Even though it was still daylight, I could only see the lights.  I could not see a craft even though it was directly over my head. When the three boys reached me,  the lights bobbed a bit, hesitated, and then rose very slowly, crossed slowly over the trees and houses,  and slowly descended into a clearing three streets away where a new junior high school was under construction.  The boys shouted: ""It?s gone over to the junior high! Let's go!"" They sped off on their bicycles and headed for the clearing.  I just stood there watching the spot where the lights had descended.  About the time it would have taken for the boys to have reached the spot, the lights slowly rose from the clearing, slowly traveled over the three streets and again hovered silently over my head.  My dog regarded me impatiently, wondering why we did not go home, but even though he was off the leash he did not react or run away. Then I heard the boys returning, shouting ""there it is!""   When the boys reached me again, the lights moved, hesitated, and then flew at incredible speed toward the late afternoon sun until it quickly disappeared as a star into the sky. There had been no sound and no turbulence.  Moreover, as I think back, the most amazing aspect of this experience was that I accepted it. ! I muttered, ""imagine that,"" to myself and walked the dog home.  I made no effort to talk to the boys about it, nor did they say anything to me.  I forgot all about it until I went to the movie ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" In the scene where the three small triangular light crafts fly through the toll gates of the freeway setting off the alarm, I pointed at the screen and cried out: ""That's what I saw!""  Then I was embarrassed,but my memory of the event had returned. I do remember seeing posted on a bulletin board at the Northern Illinois University student union a notice from a professor at a university in Chicago who was collecting reports of UFO sightings, but I made no effort to contact him, or to report my experience to anyone else.

My last tour was on the USNS Kane, a US Navy Research","At Sea, Underwater Sighting (Indian Ocean)  

In 1995 I served my last year at sea.  My last tour was on the USNS Kane, a US Navy Research Vessel charted by NAVOCEANO and under command of the Military Sealift Command.  These ships were managed and crewed by a subsidary of Dyn Services (front company for CIA or NSA) and this subsidary of Dyn Services is Dyn Marine Services, who I was employed by.  My position was AB Unlimited, or a helmsman for the land people.  A simple search on the above mentioned corporations will reveal the obvious connection.

The ships mission was submarine defense warfare related, whether it was hydrographic surveys (mapping of ocean floor), or the launching and towing of many various types of sleds, bullets, and other ""secret"" equipment.  First, the winches on board were equipped with miles of high tech optical embedded cable that was connected to the various devices, so we actually launched and retrieved to the deepest depths.  I know of several occasions while we were on ops we would have equipment in 13000 feet of water.

The ship was divided in two areas of personnel, the crew, approx. 35 including deck and engine dept., and around 30 scientists who were employed by NAVO, the US Navys Oceanographic Office.  There was a big division between these two, the crew and the scientists.  Man, were they ever tight-lipped...and their labs and quarters took up 2/3 of the ship, and all the labs were secure, no entry what so ever to the crew.

I served as primary crane operator, and the scientists became partial to me launching with the crane and operation of winches.  

In 1995 I served 336 days aboard the Kane-The night of the sighting we were in the Indian Ocean, and were pulling this rather large sled, whatever it did--when an unusual circumstance arose.  The Senior Navo Scientist came to the bridge.  Remember the division factor...and I was on the port bridge wing, my watch partner AB was on the wheel (actually in the bridge, as we were on gyro) and the Second Mate had the watch.  When the Senior came to the bridge he was actually being social, and he came out to the port wing to converse with me.  Cool, I thought, this is unusual...and as we were speaking, I saw it.

Coming up from the depths was what appeared to be a small point of light, and was quickly becoming larger as it arose from the depths. When I said ""LOOK"" and every one on the bridge was watching the Senior did a most curious thing.  He ran for the squwak box (here I have to add a note, as the scientists had their own ""conn"" or bridge, if you will, down below they were capable of steering and controlling course of the ship, however the command to turn or change course would always be relayed to us on the real bridge via this squawk box) and he said to his cohorts, and I quote his words ""Gentleman, we have INTERESTING NATURAL PHENOMENA off the port bow,"" with heavy emphasis on the words I italicized. 

As he ran back out to the port wing the object, which was round and I would guess 75 feet in diameter, was at this time I estimate was about 100 feet below our ship...it was so bright- the color of a green glow stick...and I also have to add that the seas were glass, dead calm.  Seeing was easy.  At this moment...How do I put it?...the object went back down in the opposite direction it came from- at a very steep angle and whoa...it was haulin***.  With a blur... it was gone.

Was it coincidental we stayed in this area for three days, going back and forth, around and around?  I am convinced of alien presence in our oceans.  For I SAW.

It is my hope that maybe one day we will know the TRUTH.  Our government knows, that's for sure.  Any NAVO scientists lurking here?  Maybe we all will hear from one who is willing the speak.

In autumn, 1968, I had been working Minuteman Missile Security, USAF, about 60 mi.

E. of Rapid City, S. Dak.  I'd been chosen for TDY training.  Finishing early one day, my former crew of Security Police returned from 3 days afield.  They were buying all the binoculars & cameras they could afford.  It seems a ball of light was hovering up & down over a missile site in ""India"" Flt.(White Owl/Plainview area). The Strike Team was sent to check unusual alarms & reported it.  The dayshift crews(SP)and cook went up to the roof of the LCF & watched this action in the distance for several hours.  The ""Capsule Crew"" officers reported strange readings on their monitoring instrumentation.  The Missile Wing Hdqrs. back at Ellsworth called the LCF Security NCO, saying: ""You DO have something out there, don't you?""  The object was never seen again.

This event occurred about 2 months after Rapid City newspapers reprinted accounts from papers in Wyoming and Colo. about USAF Security Police Strike Teams (2-man, in a pickup truck)had been ""chased"" from missile sites all the way back to Base, not just the LCF, at full speed, in those states.

Since I read the newspaper accounts and had worked with these peers, I'd have expected some report of this to be on-file.  Apparently, such is not the case.

I was NOT a witness to the object, itself.  If my peers had been joking, they would not have purchased the items mentioned.  All of us had SECRET clearances at the time.

I was stading on my back porch looking at the evening sky, when my attention was drawn to a bright light almost directly overhead. The light was slightly to the west when I first noticed it. It looked like a bluish white large planet (I don't know anything about astronomy, I just like to look at the sky), but I noticed that it was moving to the east. It appeared to be quite high, and was moving quite a bit faster than a commercial aircraft, but definitely slower than a meteor. The light continued going east, and I watched it until it disappeared behind some trees in the distance (almost to the eastern horizon.) The light did not flash or flicker like an exhaust or reflected light, it seemed to be self-luminous. It did not leave a trail behind like a missile or meteor. I did not see any red or green navigation lights as it departed to the east, which I would have expected it it were an aircraft. It is unusual to see any air traffic going directly west to east from this location. Riverside is under the approach for LA and Orange County airports, and there were numerous jetliners in the sky at the same time, all going from east to west, or from NE to SW for Orange County. All had easily seen red and green navigation lights and strobing white lights in addition to their landing lights. The object was noticeably different that the jetliners in appearance. There were faint jet engine noise heard, but it was probably related to the commercial aircraft going overhead at the same time.

On the evening of March 15, 2002 as the moon sat in the western sky, my husband and I noticed what looked like a star just beneath the moon.  Maybe a little to the right.  At first we assumed it was a star but not until it started to appear brighter and brighter.  Then it casted a beam (like a huge spotlight) at first straight ahead then it slowly beamed downward.  As the light slowly disappeared what seemed to be clouds started taking shape.  The light was completely gone and the clouds started to fade very slowly.

My husband and I had pulled over hoping someone had witnessed what we just saw unfortunately we were the only ones on the road.  We were hoping someone other than in our vicinity had witnessed this event.  We had never seen anything like it before. I mean it couldn't have been an aircraft of any kind much less a missil.  What kind of aircraft or missile would make a very bright light?  Although it scared us, it was in a way made a beaufiyl scenery.

I knew that if this was reported there would be some kind of excuse or cover up for it.  Not until a few years later I became aware of this website and to my surprise there were similar sightings reported. So I decided to report the incident.

Recently I've noticed many reports of orange balls of light in the sky on this website.  Thought I would post my sighting from 1977 to notify that these orange balls have been around awhile!  If they are man-made probes or drones; we had them in 1977!  The date given above is approximate; it occurred sometime in March or April, 1977.

Story below...

 ""doc"" ((name deleted)) and I were night skiing Stevens Pass ski resort (Cascade mountains, Washington State) in the spring of our senior year of high school (that's how I'm certain the year was 1977).  We were skiing down ""Red chair"" at about 8:30 pm, when I noticed an orange light in the sky, while skiing.  ""Huh"", I thought to myself, ""a firefly"".  Although it felt wierd that a firefly would be up in the mountains while they were still snow-blanketed.  I had never seen a live firefly; only pictures in books, but my mind automatically labeled it a firefly.  I slowed to a stop over about 30 seconds, keeping an eye on the ""firefly"".  As I was slowing to a stop, the light increased in apparent size from about star size to about half to 3/4 the size of a full moon.  The light was brilliant orange; scintillating light around it; the overall shape was circular but with ragged, jagged edges of this brilliant orange light.  After I came to a stop, I watched it, mesmerized, for about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  During this time, it's size and appearance did not change and it remained perfectly stationary at about 30 degrees above the horizon--I know that it remained stationary; because it remained just above and to the side of a mountain peak (behind ""Big Chief"" chair lift, to the direction of the eastern side of the ski area) that served as a reference point for me.  During this period, my friend ""doc"" ((name deleted)) skiied up and stopped beside me; I glanced over and saw his eyes glued to this wierd orange light.  As we both stood still watching,suddenly the object instantaneously darted across the sky--it went from being absolutely stationary beside the mountain peak; to traversing (in a time period of about 3 seconds) about 150 degrees of the horizon--from our vantage point; it traveled starting from the east and briefly disappeared toward the south behind a mountain peak; quickly reappearing on the opposite side of this mountain moving toward the south and continuing toward the southwest; when it finally disappeared from view behind another mountain to the southwest.  During this traverse, it was losing altitude; the angle of descent appeared about 5-10 degrees below horizontal, from our vantage point--before it finally disappeared, it was actually below us in elevation (down a valley) at about a 5-10 degree angle.  During it's transit, the object travelled almost too quickly for our heads and eyes to be able to follow; during its transit it remained brilliant orange and about the same apparent size; but appeared to have a short orange ""tail"" behind it--hard to say if this ""tail"" was an optical illusion; due to it's tremendous angular velocity from our vantage point.  Also, I seem to recall a faint hissing sound starting just as it disappeared from sight, and continuing for several seconds after it had disappeared from sight.  But no sonic boom or other sound.  I then looked at my friend, whose mouth was wide open ""did you see that?"" he said.  ""What the hell was that"" I replied.  We just looked at each other, then skiied down to the bottom of the run to get on the chairlift to ski some more.  I asked the lift attendant if he had seen anything in the sky, he said no (however, helping people on the chairlift he was facing the opposite direction of the object; and there were bright nite ski lights in the direction between him and the object).  My friend ""doc"" ((name deleted)) and I compared notes on what we saw; our descriptions matched.

 What was and still is most baffling to me was the instantaneous change in the object from being perfectly stationary (for 30-60 seconds) to moving at an extremely rapid velocity--given the first mountain it moved behind (and reappeared) was about 1.5 miles distant,and that it traversed about 150 degrees of horizon within a few seconds, it must have been moved at least 3 miles within a few seconds, corresponding to over 3600 miles per hour!  And it appeared to attain that velocity instantaneously; certainly within the half-second or less which it would take our minds to register the change from stationary to moving condition (I was a very good ping-pong player and fair badminton and tennis player,so my mind has been accustomed to very quickly registering rapid changes in speed and direction in ball-shaped objects)!  This huge acceleration rules out any manned aircraft; g-forces would tear any human apart.  Perhaps now in 2004 we have unmanned probes or drones that can perform extreme accelerations (like antiaircraft missiles); but I don't think this was possible in 1977.  A meteor is ruled out; because it was stationary in size and location near a mountain peak for 30-60 seconds; and the apparent acceleration was instantaneous, not gradual (as could happen due to parallax effects).  I think any man-made vehicle, or known natural phenomena can be ruled out.  A missile might be able to accelerate like that; however I think with only a ground-based boost system (not a mid-air launch).  This leaves unknown natural phenomena (e.g. some type of atmospheric plasma ball?) or....any ideas? P.S.  There may or may not have been a solid object behind this light--we did not observed any solid object; however the light was so brilliant that it would have obscured any otherwise nonluminescent object that it emanated from.

It was around sunset, the sky was clear, and we were all sitting around on the beach talking when we noticed two very bright lights (like a star, but around sunset) moving slowly across the sky. They were a small distance apart, one slightly lower than the other. They were there for a few minutes, then one suddenly disapeared, followed closely by the second, which lingered for about 20 more seconds, than disapeared as well. Now I've heard many cover up stories to prove that this was no ufo, but I am prepared to give facts towards what I saw. These lights were too high to be airplanes, and they weren't fireworks, missiles from submarines, rockets from Cape Canaveral, or fighter jets issued by Patrick Airforce Base (which is down the road) because it was too high for any of these objects to be. The two lights were brighter than anything I had ever seen in the sky, not to mention there was absolutely no sound whatsoever coming from the objects. They just appeared, moved slowly across the sky, then vanished within a blink of an eye. People across the state as far as Tampa witnessed these lights.

Around 3:45 in the morning. a sunday.  I was about to turn around and go to my bed when I saw a blurbed little red light pop on near Jupiter.  It was originally heading south, but it turned west from its course by large swoop-like turns, like a ball on a string.  After the first light had caught my attention, three more came out of the east, at a steady speed in a loose echeleon formation.  Two were flying straight and rigid, while the one farthest south was swerving around like a bouncy ball.  While they were as close to being directly above me as they ever came to be, an incredibly bright meteor, short, extremely fast.  It did NOT effect the craft in formation.

About fifteen minutes afterwards, I saw a another strange looking meteor, the reason I say it looked strange is because it looked extremely low, like a trace bullet.

The red lights had no particular shape, just little red blurbs of light.

 I am known to be a mostly honest person.  With only one witness, that being me, this probably doesn't count all that much.  But I knew what I saw and it scared me plenty.

I also saw the first one throght binoculars, so I knew I wasn't seeing things, and I wasn't dreaming either.

I was standing on the crest of a hill above my parent's house (in Fort Worth, Texas), looking northwards, on 20 March 1970 (approximate date) at about 4:00 PM (I was 13 years old at the time). I would sometimes look for air traffic from Carswell Air Force, to my west, from this vantage point. The sky was clear. There was no air traffic in my immediate field of view.

 I noticed a silvery, metallic object about 30 degrees above the horizon, due north. It appeared to be elliptical, but was probably disk-shaped (1). The object was perhaps two degrees in size, measured along its horizontal axis, and appeared to be fairly distant (there were no physical points of reference that would allow me to judge the size or distance of the object). The outline of the object's surface was distinct. I might not have noticed the object had it not changed its physical appearance while I was watching it. It appeared to scintillate or ""wink"", causing the object briefly to ""disappear"", or at least become difficult to see. For the duration of the observation, the object did not move horizontally or vertically from its position, nor did it appear to change size. I presumed from this that the object was spatially motionless. I could detect no sound from the object, although this may have been a function of the object's possible distance from me.

 (1) I could not, at the time, account for the object's scintillation, although I thought it might have been due to some kind of movement. I now believe the object was in fact disk-shaped, having an apparent elliptical shape due to the oblique angle at which I was viewing it. I also now believe that the object's scintillation, or ""winking"", was the result of the object changing its attitude relative to my position. If, for example, the object had been shifting its attitude (relative to me, the observer) by, say, plus/minus 45 degrees along its horizontal axis, it might have appeared to be a scintillating ellipse.

 I observed the object for perhaps 10 minutes, after which I could no longer visually resolve it in the fairly bright sky.

 Had the object been a conventional fixed-wing or rotor-winged aircraft, I believe I would have been able to track its movement from its (apparent) rest position to a point in the sky where it would have been obscured by some intervening object or would have gone below my field of view. It was not a lighter-than-air vehicle (e.g., a blimp or weather balloon), as I had seen these in Fort Worth before and was familiar with their appearance in the sky. It was not a missile, as I was also familiar with their appearance in the sky. The fact that the object appeared to loiter also presents some difficulties with its being a conventional aircraft.

 The object did not appear to be any meteorological phenomenon - at least none with which I was or am familiar. It was also not an astronomical phenomenon. The sky was far too bright to have allowed stars to be seen and, as we all know, planets do not scintillate.

 The object could have been some type of experimental vehicle. Working for a major manufacturer of advanced (read classified) air vehicles, though, I do not believe this would have been the case. If for no other reason, disk-shaped structures are difficult to control aerodynamically with current technology. It is also difficult to explain why an experimental (or conventional) air vehicle would want to change its attitude in the manner this object appeared to have.

 I am 46 years old. I live in Los Angeles, CA. I studied astronomy and physics as an undergraduate and have two Master's degrees (although not in physics or astronomy). As I mentioned above, I work for an aerospace company, selling manned and unmanned air vehicles and systems.

Another old sighting.  I was a System Analyst for SAC in the early 1960 and stationed at Ellsworth AFB, SD.   I  held the nation's highest security clearances, daily handled nuclear weapons and carried launch codes and keys.  I thus took no drugs, was a tea toddler and have never hallucinated in my life.  I was on active duty at the time.

 This was early summer 1966.  I was on base during the evening, when excited reports of UFOs on our silos were being passed around in the living quarters among the men person to person.  ""Excited utterances,"" they are called in legal jargon.  I went down to Job Control, which tracked the 150 missiles and the ten Launch Control Centers.  These Centers were manned, twenty-four seven, while the missiles are unmanned.

 That evening, in Hotel Flight, as I recall, we had an ""outer zone security violation,"" meaning that something had passed over the silo....this is often blowing vegetation or a light footed animal. The system will generally reset with the manual override.

 However this silo did not reset.

 Worse it was soon followed by an ""inter zone violation,"" meaning that something large enough to set off the vibration sensors or to touch the combinations locks, etc., was on the site.

 When the violations happen in this order, the manual calls for  a ""strike team"" to be dispatched from the LCC's above ground facility, which would be between ten and twenty miles distant. These teams generally consisted of two Air Policeman with automatic weapons.

  These men having no training in the weapon system, no clearances and are the worst educated airmen on active duty.   However they are in constant radio contract with their dispatcher and through them with the MCCCs in the LCC, a hundred feet or so below ground and via patch with Job Control back on the base, about 100 miles, in this case to the WSW.

 These men reported seeing a ""fly saucer"" on the silo cover, inside the silo and smaller objects around it, that appeared to be lights ""floating"" in the air.  The larger saucer was sitting on the silo door, a massive 30 ton concret ""hatch,"" on a short rail track.  It was thus well  inside the fence and entirely unauthorized.

 As this was an armed and targeted missile, aimed at the Soviet Union, this flagrant breach of security was taken very seriously by all concerned.

 Minutes after these objects were spotted, the call came excitedly to our quarters, so I arrived within thirty minutes of the initial OZ security violation.  I actually arrived before the AP s arrived at the silo in question.

 By the time of my arrival, at JC, the JC Commander had taken it upon himself to send the nearest team, then at work on the missiles.   This team turned out to be about thirty or forty minutes away.

 Now this was entirely ""out of the book.""  No open silo, as the one left was, was ever to be left without authorized personnel on it, since it would be launched.

 Nevertheless, the need to have a qualified observer at the site being probed by the UFOs, obviously overrode the Technical Orders of Operation.

 So the EMT team, that was nearby, was dispatched from their silo, which was under going some form of routine maintenance .  I believe this was an EMT team consisting of two Analysts and an Air Policeman.

 A Command decision, backed by SAC in Offitt AFB, lay behind this unusual order.

 Thus one AP and one Analyst were sent to the silo in question, leaving the open silo (and its deadly missile, in the hands of one man, hence the security breach).

 I remember not only overhearing the radio conversation as these Airmen approached the silo, a conversation that confirmed what the other AP s had seen, ""holly shit, there is a fuckin saucer on that silo...""  but I talked with this man, a day or so later, myself.  He had been ordered to say nothing to anyone about what he saw.  But did confirm these orders and the facts as I knew them to be.  An Analyst, he, like me had spent an year in technical school, so we were close.

 During this same period, our helicopters were roused and dispatched.  Arriving as the UFO was rising up out of the silo.  They gave chase, but were unable to close, as the objects accelerated towards the NNE.

 The sightings continued for about a week with the same pattern.  First an Outer Zone beach and then an Inter Zone.

 We had no smaller aircraft, being a tanker and bomber wing, but evidently were able to call in a nearby KC-135 ( i.e., a 707 tanker) that must have been on ""rotation"" nearby.  I myself overheard the conversation between the pilots and ""base operations"" confirming the sighting of the or a UFO in the area.  Said UFO followed the KC 135 back towards the base, with a strong radar image, but no visual image.

 The plane was required to ""fly by"" so it could be observed and nothing was seen where the radar said something was.

 By this time the Base Commander and the Wing Commander, were in the area in staff cars.  I spoke briefly with the Wing Commander, who I knew well, Col. Burrell, that evening.   As the helicopters returned, with then was a photographer who had been rousted from his bunk.  He was loaded into the staff car and driven away under escort to the photo lab.  I did not speak with him, but clearly saw his photographic gear.

 I did not see these UFOs.  I did, however, speak directly with airmen who had seen them and indeed were seeing them.

 During that week there were numerous reports, so numerous that the Air Force announced that B-58 bombers were flying over on ""maneuvers.""  But, of course, whatever landed on Hotel 6 wasn't a B-52.

 I am fully confident that during the summer of 1966 UFOs visited our Minuteman silos in the Dakotas, landed upon and penetrated those silos.  We were powerless to stop them and the USAF covered up this entire chapter.

 I suspect it is still classified and that I should not be talking about these events.

 I vaguely remember being instructed not to speak about these matters and was, of course, operating under very tight above Top Secret security clearances.

 I come forth because the missiles are non longer on active duty, the silos decommissioned and the time long past.  I can think of no reason why these events should be covered up in the name or color of national security.

 Something major happened that summer.  And it happened to nuclear weapon systems that were armed and on duty at the time.

Perhaps this is related to the account on the same evening from the airliner crew over Omaha, NE.

 This is what I witnessed in the sky over Toronto on Mar 25, 2004 at 6:30 pm EST, and I would like to preface this by saying my eyesight is much better than 20/20, especially when viewing something long distance:   Two small (10 feet in diameter at the most) black or dark coloured orbs/spheres or discs in the sky, floating (I would say flying but they were wingless) silently and parallel to each other, from west to east following identical flight paths and speed.  The more southern of the two was perhaps (estimate) 20 or 30 full size passenger plane lengths ahead of the other.  Due to the formation I kept looking to see if there was a 3rd object where one would expect it be (the 3rd point in the hypothetical triangle) but there certainly was not.  I also kept looking between the two discs to see if they were connected by anything visible, but again, nothing but the cloud above them was seen.

 I could hear various air traffic above me that evening but not see any airplanes as the clouds were quite low, yet these objects were beneath the cloud cover.  When they were a fair distance away from me and I had a more ""head on"" angle view to them I noticed they appeared to be gyrating in the manner in which a bullet travels down a barrel of a gun (tight spirals) as it moves forward.  Eventually they just became too far away to see.

Just observed some kind of object/vehice enter into the atmosphere in the northern sky from 8:47 - 8:48 PM. We were traveling north on Flamingo Road north of Griffin Road near Fort Lauderdale, approaching Flamingo Gardens. Noticed a bright orange/red glow, stationary at about 35-40 degrees above the horizon, just above the tree line as seen from the road. Size made it appear to be an aircraft beacon but more orange/pink in color than a red beacon. The other problem is there is no beacon in the vicinity.

 This ""object"" was apparently motionless but after about 15 seconds a long tail of ""flame"" appeared behind the object, indicating that it was entering the atmosphere from the north, thus the bright reddish glow and tail. The tail lasted about five seconds after which the object began to fade steadily and it turned to the east at a high altitude at a rapid speed, that of a fast jet. There were no aircraft style lights or beacons from the object. It faded in intensity after it turned east.

 This unnerved me since I have never seen anything like this, and the apparent direction was from the north, which would be a strange direction of reentry for a typical spacecraft.

 I am familiar with meteorites, which at the rate of speed on entry, streak across the sky in about 1 second. This episode lasted the better part of a minute and was obviously not a meteorite. I wonder if you have any information on this episode that you can share. A driver behind me also pulled over to observe this object. Whatever it is, the sight was extremely unusual and compelling. My daughter was with in the car and saw the object as well.

Iowa Air National Guard and 727 watched by UFO in West Des Moines Iowa

-The IOWA AIR NATIONAL GUARD, including 4 or more F14 Fighter jets (unsure of exact military aircraft model) were one by one flying over the Racoon River between Des Moines and West Des Moines preparing for landing.

-I was on my daily hike through the Raccon River Park in West Des Moines heading east, with the F14's directly overhead and in front of me approximately 500 feet over head. I stopped to watch them 'bank' or make a tight right turn to get in position to land at the Des Moines Airport.

-I watched the first F14, then the second, each came by about 20 seconds apart.

-As I was wathching the 2nd F14 and looking closesely to see if their were weapons attached underneath the planes (they were very close and I could see the entire plane very clearly, something entered my site above the F14's that was extemely high in the sky.

-The object started out as a small bright shining metal object because it was so high, that was all I could see.

-I watched the object come directly down from the highest point in the sky to the 3rd F14 that had now entered my view right in front of me. He had started his bank or right turn and could also see under that F14.

-Before the object was close the the F14 I could then see the shape of the object.

-Description of object: Once it had descended close enough for me to see, I saw that it was bright, shiny metallic exactly like the metal 'mercury'. It was shaped like a bullet when it was coming directly at me. It was approximately 1/2 the size of the F14.

-It approached the 3rd F14 from the top, and turned sideways and this is when I saw it change shape. It changed from a bullet looking object to a round flat sphere. The rear was not rounded, but was straight. It was able to change like controlled mercury.

-Immediately as it turned sideways it dove under the F14 and started what I call 'sniffing' at the F14, or observing the underneath of the plane.

-It was maintaing the same speed with the F14 as it went from the right wing, ducked under the F14 exhaust,engine and went to the left wing and continued the same observation on that side of the F14.

-The 3rd F14 continued its extreme turn to head for the Des Moines Airport and the object then left the F14 turning left off of the left wing or heading west.

-The object flew slowly at the same altitude approximately 500 feet and hovered.

-The object then turned to face west, while hovering.

-The object hovered after turning as if it was looking at something west, or behind me. I had a perfect view at this time of the object as it was approximately 1000 feet from me.

-The object then turned north, while hovering, then flew at approximately a 75 degree angle upwards straight again to the highest point I could see in the sky at extremely high speeds, but still able to watch it leave our space. I would say it was like watching a F14 go almost straight up at full speed (which I have watched) and multiple that speed by 10.

-The other or rest of the F14's made thier approach while I was watching the object leave.

-20 seconds later 727 passenger jet came over my left shoulder at the same height of the F14's. That is what the object seemed to be looking at, but by the time the jet had gotten parellel with me, the object was out of view.

-Witnesses: The pilots of the 727 had to see the object, it was right in front of them hovering. The 3rd F14 pilot had to see the object immediately when it was descended upon. It was also right in front of his windshield. The 4th F14 pilot was right behind the 3rd and had to see the object, no question. Myself as a witness.

Yes my husband and myself were the witness in the vehicle. We had no pets with us at the time of the sighting. There were a few people on the street but I'm not sure if they noticed what we saw. We were pretty shocked and a bit dumb-founded. The shape was like a silver-bullet trailer but alot longer and larger, quite frankly it was huge. There looked to be an observation deck and I could see the people inside. Underneath this platform were many small shaped windows like seen on a ship. It was white/silver in color. No blue, red or orange lights that we could see, no haze was seen either.

 One thing I will tell you is that the people on that craft did notice us looking back at them and for a brief moment I made eye contact with one of them. This being looked just like me, female. She nor the others appeared to have large heads and big eyes. Then it vanished in a instant, I blinked and it was gone. There was no sound that we could here. I said to my hubby how could something that big just hover? He has always been interested in planes etc. and he said I don't ""explanatory"" know! What the heck was that?! No aircraft did we see or hear afterwards. An older lady once told me: if your always looking up towards the sky this means your a good person, I think my hubby and I are fortunate soul's for having the opportunity to see what we did that day!  In addition my hubby would like me to tell you that this ship was,what he could figure,about 3-4 hundred feet long and about 1000 feet up from us.He also said to make sure I tell you that it was a clear summer day not a cloud in the sky.

 Enjoy your day.

From Reuters   5/11/04  Are you aware of this report?  MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican Air Force has released footage of what a UFO expert said were 11 invisible unidentified flying objects picked up by an infrared camera as they whizzed around a surveillance plane.

A long-time believer in flying saucers, journalist Jaime Maussan told a news conference Tuesday the objects were real and seemed ""intelligent"" after they at one point changed direction and surrounded the plane chasing them.

""They were invisible to the eye but they were there, there is no doubt about it. They had mass, they had energy and they were moving about,"" he said, after showing a 15-minute video he said the Defense Ministry gave him permission to publicize.

The ministry confirmed to Reuters it had provided the video, filmed by the Air Force on March 5 over the eastern coastal state of Campeche.

""We are not alone! This is so weird,"" one of the pilots can be heard yelling, after the plane's crew switched on an infrared camera to track the objects, first picked up by radar.

The film, recorded by a plane looking for drugs trafficking near the Gulf of Mexico, shows 11 objects as blobs of light that hover in formation or dart about, sometimes disappearing into cloud.

Mexico's most popular nightly news broadcast showed the video Monday night.

Interviewed by Mausson on another section of the video, the pilots said they grew nervous when the objects, still invisible, turned back during a chase and surrounded the plane.

""There was a moment when ... the screens showed they were behind us, to the left and in front of us. It was at that point that I felt a bit tense,"" said Maj. Magdaleno Castanon.

Mexico has a long history of fanciful UFO sightings, most of which are dismissed by scientists as space debris, missiles, weather balloons, natural weather phenomena or hoaxes.

The object was clearly defined, and I could see details of the structure and interior lines although the object seemed to be translucent with a white outline and sky blue interior. This may have been because of the altitude of the craft. It appeared as the size of a basketball at about 100' or less. I estimate that it was atleast 400' long and wide (approx. equal). I suspect that it was 2-5 miles in altitude. Any farther would have made it unbelievably hugh. Each side of the craft (port and starboard) was glowing a rosey pink as if heat was being generated there. There was another smaller craft tailing the larger, and it followed at a constant distance of an estimated 500'. It was dificult to see details of the smaller because of the white and gray smokey trail it left behind. It appeared to be bullet shaped with a shiny, metalic nose and a reflective glassy material (cockpit?) behind that. The rest of the second object was obscured by the smoke. The viewed part seemed to be approx 40' long and 15-20' wide. They travelled west to east along the Arizona/Mexico border. It took from 1.5-2 seconds to cover an estimated distance (to the horizon) of 25 miles.

I do not believe in aliens and ""space ships"" but I cannot explain what I saw the other night at my home in Doncaster in the UK.  Since I saw the unidentified flying objects I have been scanning the web trying to find pictures of something similar.  As yet, I have not found anything that matches what I saw.

I was sat in my living room playing on my games console when I saw a light in the sky out of the corner of my eye, I hit the pause button on my game and stared through the window at the lights in the sky.  There was a big oval ring of light with two smaller lights near it moving across the sky.  They were not round, but oval and not in perfect triangular formation.  They were very high up in the sky, higher than you would typically see planes and the jet stream from planes and it was very bright.  The lights were a white/light yellow colour - I couldn't work out whether there was a haze around the lights or whether the lights were that bright that it just looked like a haze.  The main ring of light was very large - I guess maybe 5 to 10 times larger than a medium sized plane.

It all happened very quickly, but as I started to look at the lights they suddenly just sped off in to the distance very very quickly.  I don't believe there is anything that could travel that fast - there is no jet or missile that could travel that quickly. The whole thing lasted for no more than a couple of seconds.

My logical brain quickly thought it might be a light reflection in the glass of the window pane or a new type of plane, but I could see it in the sky so I know it wasn't a reflection and this light was so big and so fast that there is no way it could be a plane.

Before you ask, no I hadn't been drinking or taking any drugs. I don't know what I saw and I only wish I had evidence to show you. I have done a drawing (which is not my best subject) to give you an idea as to what it looked like.","Production Manager",0,3,"oval",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2004,2000,2,5,22,"Night",NA,0,1,0,0,0

I was bringing the trash to the curb, when I noticed an object hovering above.. kind of like a boomerang shaped object, dimly lit.. I could just barely make out the outline against the night sky.  In the center was a dimly lit round red window or light.. the object appeared to be a couple hundred feet high; perhaps 70-100 feet from tip to tip; while hovering the object made a slight circular motion.  The circles became larger in diameter; it then made a spiraling maneuver and sped off like a bullet to the south over the trees in the woods behind my house. (I live on a wooded 1-acre lot in a semi-metropolitan area).  This whole time, the object made no sound.

It continued going in the same direction as I was, becoming smaller and smaller until it became a small white light just before it disappeared, which was about the same time that I reached the city of Arroyo Grande.  The sky was quite clear, so it was easy to see.

I had at first theorized that it could be a plane on fire, but it never came down. Then I thought perhaps it was a meteor or ""shooting star"" - but it was still daylight, there were no stars yet visable, and it never ""disappeared"" as shooting stars do.  Then I thought of a missile from Vandenburgh A.F.B., but realized that they are usually shot off in a westerly direction (in case they fail, they will dump in the ocean and not hit cities, homes, etc.).  I still wonder if it was a missile shot off at an earlier date, that just happened to be low enough for me to see now.

The craft was soundless and completely devoid of any light source except for an amber basketball size mass of swirling energy that seemed to posses electrical properties.

The amber ball of swirling energy was located underneath the faintly silver rim of a UFO and was located nearest me along the rim.

The craft then emitted a red cone-shaped beam from its underside seemingly searching for a landing site. Moments later, the craft paused and a string of red lights began flashing back and forth in a 5-4-3-2-1, 1-2-3-4-5- pattern around the objects midsection. The first craft was then joined by a second craft that flew in from its right side. The two crafts then dropped below the treeline and out of sight.

Minutes later, two jets and a single column of helicopters approached the UFO hotspot from the east.

After several minutes the Air Force jets and choppers left the area.

At approximately 1:50 am the craft to the left rose up from the exact location that it had disappeared below the tree line nearly seven hours earlier.

The object displayed the same pattern of red flashing lights around its middle.

Then it shot straight up, paused and then the red flashing lights began to fade as the UFO took on a more luminous appearance and reminded me of a star as it just hung there in the dark, starry sky.

Then, the eastern horizon lit up with orange and white colors as a Minute Man 2 missile rose up and within moments began its arc downrange the Eastern Test Range over the Atlantic.

The luminous UFO then began zig-zagging across the sky, then performed a falling-leaf pattern, and all in one continuous lightning-swift motion.

Then the UFO shot to the left and seemed to draw very near the rapidly climbing missile. Then the UFO darted to the right, paused then shot off to the right again and vanished.

I waited until sunrise but I never got to see the second craft leave the location of which it had apparently landed nearly 12 hours or so earlier.

The above UFO sighting was the first of numerous other sightings that happened in the same area over the course of the next nine months.

During the late 1990's, I was on active duty in the Air Force, stationed at Whiteman AFB.  On the evening of July 26, 1997 I was washing my car at a self-serve car wash on the north east side of Warrensburg Mo. next to highway 50.  The sky was clear and there were still a couple of hours until sunset.  I noticed 2 dark objects hovering over the south-central side of town, about 2 miles away, at an altitude of about 1500 feet AGL.  The objects were identical, each consisting of an equilateral triangle with a sphere at each corner.  The thickness of the triangular portion was approximately one quarter of the objects' length, with the spherical sections' diameter about twice the thickness of the triangular section.  They appeared to be about 100 to 150 feet long.  The objects were flat black in color with no visible markings, intake/exhaust ports, or windows.  I could not hear any sounds from the objects.  The southern most object did not move at all, watching it was like staring at a photograph.  The northern most object only occasionally yawed from left to right about 60 degrees in each direction.  Its position in relation to the unmoving object never changed.  After about 45 minutes, I turned away to insert more coins in the car wash, and when I turned back, the objects were gone.  Less than a minute after the objects disappeared, three A-10 attack aircraft from Whiteman AFB flew over me less than 200 feet up, they were heading west, paralleling highway 50.  I could see that the only ordinance they were carrying were sidewinder air to air missiles.  The A-10s turned south and flew over the center of Warrensburg, towards the previous location of the objects.  At that location, they broke formation and continued south along slightly different vectors.  For the remainder of my Air Force career, I did not report my sighting, nor even tell anyone about it.

At 11:00 pm on Sunday, 6-20-04, approximately one-half mile before the W. Marginal Way exit, while driving north on highway 509 coming down the hill toward the First Avenue Bridge, I saw a medium size star bright lit object above me, about the altitude of 10K feet, moving from my left to my right as an extreme high rate of speed. It flew in an extreme straight line of flight direction with no slight movement, but with great accuracy in one direction.  It was flying downward at a slant toward the north end of Boeing Field just a tad before it reached that field where it made, in less than 1 second, an approximate 100 degree south-southerly turn, the white star light dropping down, like in a bank turn, to then quickly upward in a steady rise to leveling out going south toward the south end of Boeing Field, it?s speed dropping maybe 10-15 percent after that first turn. It then began to drop lower downward and slowing to about 50 percent less speed, going into a soft rounded south-west-westerly bank turn, the light dropping to the right downward then leveling up and out, for a distance of about one-fifth of a mile, then another similar sharp turn but to a sharp north-north-easterly direction for about the same distance, the light moving upward to the left and then leveling out, then another similar turn south-south-westerly for the same distance, the light moving down to the right and then leveling out, and then one more such turn but wider into a north-east-easterly direction, the light moving to the left upward and then leveling out, where it was then flew out of sight past the hill to the west of the Boeing Renton air field. I could not make out the shape of the object the light was attached to, but over the freeway I had the distinct image of it being long and narrow, but after the turns it made then more like a plane, but that could have been my eyes playing tricks with trying to attach some shape to it. It had no other lights on it. At first I thought it was a shooting star but it was ! not moving in a curve. Then I thought it was a comet, but it didn?t have a changing tail behind it ? it did have a tail, but very very faint, but I knew it was too close to the earth to be a comet. Then I thought it was a meteorite since one fell near Chehalis recently. Then I thought it might have been a plane coming in for a crash or emergency landing to Boeing Field. And I also thought it might be a cruise missile or test drone craft that Boeing might be testing. I really did expect an explosion so the whole incident was quite scary causing me to quickly cross all the lanes on the freeway from the left to the right emergency lane to stop where I called 911 to report it.

I was outside behind our house when I heard a loud noise behind me, like an airliner or F-16 flying by overhead. Our house is under the flight paths for both D/FW Int. Airport and the joint reserve base in Fort Worth, so we often hear and see jets. I was facing northwest when I heard the noise. I looked over my shoulder to the south and saw a very bright white contrail (or smoke trail), very dense and wide, extending from the south heading directly north. Airliners never travel in this path -- they always go east-west or west-east.

 I visually followed the contrail north until I spotted what initially looked like an airliner, EXCEPT IT HAD NO WINGS. The object and its contrail were higher than the clouds. The object had little fins at the back end like a missile. The contrail was much wider than the object. After about 20 seconds, the object faded out of view. At this point, I went into the house to get my 30-year-old daughter. She came outside and we both saw the contrail still clearly visible in the sky. The trail was slowly fanning out. However, we could both see that the trail started and ended abruptly. We took digital photos of the contrail, which show that it was above the clouds.

 After taking the photos, I called my husband -- an ex-Air Force pilot -- to tell him about the object. He had no idea what it was. That night, he asked me to draw a picture of the object. The next morning, at work, he showed the drawing and photos of the contrail to his ex-fighter pilot buddies. None of them knew what it was, but all of them said it looked like a missile. They had no idea what kind of missile, but it must've been huge based on its altitude. The object was too large to be a missile from an F-16 and there are no nearby launch facilities for other types of missiles.

 I know what airliners and fighter jets look like. This was neither. I have photos of the contrail and a drawing of the object.

Strange dream last night. Here is what I can remember.

 I was outside with a friend at night in a sidewalk cafe in Los Angeles. I was looking at the stars and noticed that there were more than usual. Then, these small, what appeared to be remote drone planes flew by with no pilots. They were probably 3 feet in length...white, and very tubular in shape. I yelled, ""Look at these!!"" and that's when the sidewalk was invaded by men dressed in black, with guns coming from everywhere. They were herding us all together and there were hundreds of people now on the street, screaming.

 Then something odd happened; they were shouting orders and threatening to ""put a button in everyone's neck"" but the man in charge was looking straight at me. I was freaked!  He should have known that I already had one, but he shot this gun at me that didn't have bullets; it had some type of electrical-tingly sensation instead...not pain...but it most definitely got me to stop in my tracks and pay attention!  Then he came up with this long, round tube about a foot long, and 2 inches in diamter and put it to my left eye.  Next thing I know is it Puffed into my left eye.I was SO scared.  I didn't know what he had just done to me.

 People were still screaming.

 I can't hold on to much more of the dream, but I stayed awake all night once it woke me up because I didn't want to forget it.

 When I did wake up, however, in the morning saw 2 very visible ""burn"" marks on me, one on the wrist, and one on my upper arm, at a diagonal.

 I have only taken pics today, at your advice, on 7-1-04,...they have faded somewhat, but are still there.  I don't know why I did not take photos for a week!  I have a scar on my tail bone from a few years ago, and then, too, like this week, I did not think of documenting it!  How strange indeed!  There was NO pain associated with these burns, and that is what I call them because they were very red, and looked like I had put my arm and wrist to a hot coal, or seomthing similar.  However, I had NOT.

On the night of July 12, 2004, my family and I embarked on a road trip from the San Francisco Bay Area to New Mexico.  While travelling south on Interstate-5 in the central valley of California, at about 10:15 pm, we encountered the I-5 UFO phenomenon that has been reported to NUFORC several times since at least the year 2000.  It was a triangular aircraft flying a repetitive aerobatic pattern over the interstate and swooping down very low over traffic, creating a hazard to all who were driving.

We saw it as we approached from 2 to 3 miles away, and were amazed at it's agility and audacity right from the start.  It occurred 28 miles north of Highway 198 at the intersection of I-5 and the overpass of Manning Avenue.  The aircraft's maneuvers were incredible, but not beyond human capability.  The craft flew a fast, distinct, unchanging pattern over the interstate and overpass, swooping down to an unbelievably low level over the freeway traffic.  We and every other vehicle around us slowed down to observe it, and once underneath it, we hoped we wouldn't get hit.  We drove past the overpass, which was remote and had no exit/entrance ramps and then parked on the shoulder about 100 yards south of it, right below the pattern that the aircraft was flying.  My wife and I tried hard to get a good look, but it was very dark; no moon and no city lights anywhere near us.

The craft seemed to be triangular, yet not an equilateral triangle.  It was shaped more like a Vulcan bomber; the wings formed a wide delta, yet their leading edge intersected the fuselage well behind the nose.  I could not make out the profile of the nose, yet I could see the profile of a vertical tail fin.  The vertical height of the fuselage seemed thin, but not too thin for a human pilot.  It's lights were completely unconventional; no strobe, no red and green position lights, no navigation light.  It just had 3 big bright circular halogen white lights, about 12""-18"" in diameter; one under the nose, and one at each wingtip.  The nose light would turn off and then turn back on.  They all shined down and forward about 45 degrees, and were built into the body; they weren't fixtures hanging down.  They put out an ambient glow onto the fuselage, which was a very pale tan or grey.  There were no other markings and no landing gear visible.  Unlike previous reports of this phenomenon to NUFORC, which described a silent craft, (and I don't discount them), this craft made a lot of noise.  In fact, it sounded like it had a single jet engine.  As it approached, it made a whining, hissing sound, which turned into a roar as it passed, yet not as loud or fast as a corporate or fighter jet.  The craft maintained a speed of about 80 to 100 mph throughout it's maneuvers.  A high-performance engine might explain how it made steep climbs and 90 degree banking turns without stalling or losing speed.

It flew a repetitive kidney-bean shaped pattern above the freeway intersection with the overpass.  It dived down and flew 15'-20' above the I-5 traffic, climbed up, hung a U-turn, then dove down to the field on the east side of the interstate, and flew an amazing 2-3 feet above the ground for about 100 yards until it approached the embankment of the overpass, then pulled up and climbed at about 45 degrees without slowing down to about 200 feet above ground, hung a sharp U-turn banking at 90 degrees to the ground,then dove down again at the interstate, and repeated this pattern over and over.  Whether the pilot was an off-hours yahoo cropduster or an alien, he was out of his mind.  While parked on the shoulder, we watched the aircraft fly the pattern right over us several times before driving off (my 6 year-old daughter was getting scared).

I wish I could provide a more definitive identification of the aircraft, but it was very dark that night and the craft was constantly making sharp moves: banking, climbing, and diving.  My best guess is that this was a powerful, unconventional, yet terrestrial airplane, but the pilot was performing maneuvers that weren't just bold, but crazy and malicious toward the traffic on I-5.  Everything about the aircraft's actions and lighting was illegal.

I called the California Highway Patrol after driving away, and the dispatcher shrugged it off, saying, ""I'll put out a bulletin, but there's not much we can do.  You might want to try the FAA.""  I'll forward this report to the FAA in the hopes that they might look into it, being that this incident constitutes crimes being committed with an aircraft.  Either this is some rogue cropduster that hasn't been caught yet, or this area along I-5 is definitely a UFO hotspot.

I ran into my house and got my binoculars, when I got got back it was maneuvering erratically a little to the north. When I got a good look at it, it was a black triangle with a bright red line accross the back. It was wider than long, like a large hang-glider.  After about 30 seconds it stopped and rotated slowly in place one complete turn then shot off to the east like a bullet.  The sky was mostly clear and blue with a few puffy white clouds.  It looked to me to be as high as commercial air traffic which would have made it about the size of a 747.  I noticed no sound but I could hear a jet at about the same altitude a few seconds later moving in almost the same direction.  The triangle left no contrail but the jet did.

While grilling some fish outside I noticed a bar of white light in the southeastern ski near the star Arcturus. It was a five degree blob of light that looked like a cloud. Using binoculars, I resolved the blur into what looked like an angel-shaped blob of light... complete with wings. Sounds incredible, but that's what it looked like. This was a cloud of light...not a craft and after an hour it dissipated. It looked similar to a cloud formation when a rocket blasts off ... I saw a similar cloud two years ago in Arizona when a rocket shot off from California.

What the hell was this strange cloud? I know it sounds weird saying it looked angel-shaped... but oddly enough, it looked like that...at least in binoculars.

I am a Police Officer for the Borugh of Mount Carmel. Looking into the western sky as I was talking to a friend (who happens to be a sience teacher) I said to him ""Now what do ya call that?"" What we saw  was a fuzzy rectangular shaped light (almost like aircraft lights ahowing through cloud cover, but there wasn't a cloud in the sky) It appeared to be stationary in relation to the houses. As we watched others (3) also observed it. The more we watched it we noticed that it was moving very slowly North. I went inside my business and got binoculars. Through the binoculars the object looked almost like a Nebula that had exploded. It was all whaite lighted and I noticed a white light on the rear of it that blinked in no particular rhythm. Again it was moving verys slowly and by watching the stars in relation to the object close up I could tell it wasn't following the planets rotation it was definately headed North. The longer we watched it, it slowly began to fade. No noise was heard through out the entire event. The best I can describe the shape of it is like this  -)(-  ....

I have no idea what we saw. If it were a stray cloud it would have broken apart and lost its shape as it moved. It did not. And clouds usually don't come with blinking lights, no matter what the rhythm.

I then acquired it with my binoculars and could plainly see a strobe on the very point of the object, flashing white in about a .5 second cycle. As the anomoly moved eastward slowly, it began looking more like a cloud, which was formed to this apparent shape(see attached) but being extremely dense , especially nearest the strobe.The shape was perfectly symmetrical and well defined.  The light stopped flashing after a minute or so and was no longer visible.

On Tuesday, August 31, 2004 at about 8:40 pm:  Our Daughter called my Wife and I to the front door of our house.  She told us that she saw a UFO in the sky.  I was very skeptical when approaching.  I really did not expect to see anything.  However, there was clearly something to see in the sky to the West of our location.

 Our Daughter went in the house to find the binoculars and I went in to find the telescope and camera.  My Wife watched it while our Daughter and I went into the house.  When we came out, it was still there and was visible with the naked eye and very distinct when viewed through the binoculars.  I could not focus on it through the telescope nor could I find it in the viewfinder of my camera.  There did not seem to be enough light from the object to get it on the camera.

 The night sky was dark, but very clear.  The moon had not risen yet.  And there were no visible clouds in the sky.  Two airplanes were visible in the sky, but appeared to be flying lower than the object in the sky and the size of this object was much larger than the airplanes.

 The shape of the object, when viewed through the binoculars was like a cigar shape in the middle and 4 jetting protrusions curving away from the cigar like center.  Also, when looking through binoculars (7x50 power), the overall object looked to be gaseous in form.  However, it never lost its shape (I watched it for about 30 minutes).  The color was a gray to white, but of course this was about 8:45 pm and dark outside. The only other way I can describe the color was that it looked similar to viewing a comet, but of course the shape was not typical of a comet.  The tip of the object, on the cigar like center, had an intermittent flash that would occur about every 30 seconds.  This flash was not visible with the naked eye, only through binoculars.  The flash was like that of a dimly lit star, but as the object moved slowly across the sky (toward the East), the flash stayed at the point on the cigar portion of the object.

 When the object was almost directly overhead, it appeared to move further away (higher in the sky).  It became fainter and harder to see.  Even looking through the binoculars, it held its shape but became smaller and dimmer.

 At this point I went in the house.

It moved slower than any satellite I have seen. It made no sound. the sky was very clear and full of stars, with just a few left-over cumulus clouds. Sunset was 19:27 and moonrise was 20:30, though the moon was behind a hill from here at the time of observing this object.

This is the sort of sighting that I'm sure has a rational explanation... I'd just like to know what it is.

 Tonight my girlfriend and I were leaving our apartment in Bellefonte PA and heading towards State College, about 15 minutes away. As we topped a hill, we noticed an odd disturbance in the sky. I thought at first that it was the twin landing lights of an airplane, flying through thin clouds (there are numerous flight paths over central PA). There were two elongated, grey-white luminous bands, surrounded by a gently glowing white haze, something like this:  . . . . . .

. . === . === . .

. . . . . .

 where == are the bands and the periods are the haze. Anyway, I thought it was an airplane over some clouds. But I soon realized that it didn't appear to be moving. It was not very bright, and it reminded my girlfriend of a comet. Indeed, aside from the funky geometry, it DID look like a very bright comet (like a milky star, as Hale-Bopp looked, at its brightest magnitude, for example). But unlike a comet, it was moving very slowly across the sky (we parked the car to watch, and I tracked its movement against a church steeple). It moved from the southwest to the northeast, roughly, and its speed resembled that of a slow cloud: perhaps one degree of sky per minute. Several planes flew overhead during this time, and I was able to compare them both in terms of motion and appearance. There was no resemblence at all. The object was gray and nebulous; the planes were clear and their red and green lights were perfectly visible. Stars were also visible overhead and all around the object; although there were clouds on the horizon, the sky above was very clear.

 As we watched the object for approximately three minutes, it very slowly began to disperse and fade. The parallel luminous bands became splotches, and finally the whole thing degenerated into a slightly luminous cloud approximately the visible size of my thumb held at arm's length.

 The past-full moon was just rising, though it was mostly obscured by clouds to the south east. Those clouds and the moon were purple and yellow, generally, and I did not have the impression that the object was illuminated by moonlight (though I can't be sure). As the object faded and became more cloudlike, we drove to a darker spot to watch it, which we did for perhaps another 8 minutes. I telephoned by brother in Louisiana, and asked him if he could see it (I was hoping to decide if the object was in space, in orbit, or in the atmosphere). He could not see it, but reported strong light pollution.

 By this time, the object had faded to the point that I would not have noticed it, had I not been looking. It was still perhaps 10 degrees from directly overhead and very dim, visible to the west and drifting east. My girlfriend and I continued our trip to State College, and when we arrived, clouds obscured the sky. The clouds cleared perhaps 20 minutes later, and there was no trace left of the object.

 I have no reason to believe this was anything other than some odd weather or astronomical phenomena, but neither of us has ever seen anything like it. Any ideas?

I saw exaclty as the picture already drawn saw. It was almost like a cloud, but had the definate shape as drawn on the web site. Actually got to get my telescope out to look at it. Definitely saw the flashing light. I first saw it about 20 degrees above horizon, and thought it was a comet. It was about magnitude 1.0, thats what caught my eye, and as an amatuer sky watcher, knew there wasn't supposed to be something in the sky at that regionat at this time. Ran and got binoculars, and could not figure out what it was, so I ran to get my wife and telescope. It rose to about 80 degrees above the horizon, getting fainter and fainter, but could still see the strope light.

From my position it was in the southwest sky. After about 10 minutes, it was almost opaque against the dark sky. Thats what my wife and I saw. We came into the house, and both drew what we saw on paper, and it was just like the image on your website. As I live near a major airport, planes were still flying as normal landing patterns.

Wow!! I never thought I would actually see a UFO. Keep looking up. Thanks

I had been talking to my sister on my cell phone outside around 8:30 P.M. Tuesday, August 31, 2004. I was the first person in my family to see the shape in the sky around 8:35 P.M. EST. I watched the shape for several minutes, which upon first glance resembled an exploded airplane to the naked eye. It never once seemed to be a comet or round object, but I could tell it was very high in the atmosphere. There was a distinct long, white, horizontal bar in the center of what looked like ""debris"", or ""white light"" radiating from the bar. Watching it five minutes later with binoculars, the shape had moved north and the ""debris"", or ""white light"" had dissipated enough so that the white bar had disappeared, and the ""debris field"", or ""white light"" had separated into two very distinct halves. I had spoken to an older sister around 9:15 P.M. EST who lives in Florida, and she did not see it. The shape had continued to dissipate and move north toward Canada, then due east toward Pennsylvania until it had disappeared altogether around 9:30 P.M. EST. Please remember that much of my own account was seen by the naked eye. The moon had not yet risen, so it was fairly dark outside. My parents had used a telescope and binoculars through most of the observation whereas I had not.

While trying out a new telescope last night I witnessed the same object. At first I thought it to be deep space. I viewed it through a lens with 78x power and it looked nebulous ,rather cloud like. I went in to get binoculars and it apparantly moved Eastward quite quickly and had lost much of its shape. The Moon was rising and I figured it was only a cloud reflecting Moonlight. I told my wife about it and said at first I thought I'd spotted some thing strange in the heavens but felt foolish as I factored in the Moon. Guess I did see something .

Our band was having a rehersal.  At apx. 9m we took a break and all 6 of us went out onto the back deck.  I noticed a strange site in the sky.  It looked like two very large stars shaped like rectangles and lightly covered by a cloud.  It was a completely clear night with no other clouds at all.  The ""stars"" seemed to be pulsing slightly and the ""nebula"" surrounding them began to grow larger and disperse over the next 15 minutes.  We observed the ""nebula"" cloud consistently moved north east.   And then interestingly enough, we observed at least 3 ""shooting stars"" within the same 15 min. span.  We saw at least 5 other small aircraft flying in the same vicinity.

 At first, we discussed whether it could be the moon in cloud cover but the sky was clear and the moon was to east.  Then we discussed how it appeared to be an explosion in the higher atmosphere (50,000 to 60,000 feet).  One member of Zen (the band) is an experienced pilot and flight instructor and it was through his experience that we arrived at these estimates of distance.  His comment was, ""in all my years of flying, I've never seen anything like this.""  We wondered if it could possibly be a large passenger airplane enroute from Washington, DC that had exploded at that altitude (maybe a terrorist event).

At 9pm EST I went outside to let our house dogs out.  I decided since there were no mosquitos evident to sit on the front porch. It was a beautiful clear sky and the full moon hadn't come up yet. I could see many stars above and since we do not live in the city, the lights of the stars were clear.  I could see the glow of the lights of the city of Belleville to the south of us.

 At approx 9:10pm I noticed a strange orangy object on the Western horizon above the hill to the northwest of us.  I called my husband out to see this as this object was moving towards our house and it was bigger than any plane I have seen.  He came out and viewed the object in the sky.  Then went inside to get his binoculars.  When he came out and viewed the object with the binoculars he noticed its unusual shape.

 ""I determined that it was shaped like a snow angel with a pointed head, that is it was an elongated object with four fan-like projections at its sides.  The pointed head had a blinking light.  As it approached its colour changed to white.""  We then called our son out to view this object in the sky.  He confirmed the same shape that we had both observed.

 It was moving from west to east and heading right over our house.  All three of us viewed this object coming towards the house and its shape and size.  It seemed to be  a glowing cloud with a flashing light.  The 'angel' shape was glowing and you could see stars through it.  However at the 'pointed' end you could not see stars through it.  We also noted 5-6 aircraft all heading the same direction around the object.  Some did appear to be circling the object.  The object was considerably larger than any of these planes.

 Approximately 9:15pm-9:20pm, the objects light stopped blinking.  But, the cloud 'angel' continued to move towards our house (easterly).

 At this point (approx 9:25pm) Gordon went back into the house.  My son and I stayed out to watch this object.  It was now almost directly over the house.  I had the binoculars and watched as a bright circular orangey-yellow object flew out of the cloud.  This object was about the size of 1/4 of the full moon.  The object headed directly north at a much faster speed than the cloud had been moving.  The object appeared to be about 1/8 the size of the full moon when it reached the stars that make up the Big Dipper. It reached that position in the sky in about 30 seconds.  The object then turned 90 degrees and headed back west.  It disappeared moments later.  The cloud disappeared within 5 minutes of the object leaving it.

 All planes then seemed to have left the vicinity when we looked for them again after the object disappeared. All the ones we had observed around this object that is.

 It should be noted here that at no time did we hear any noise from this object.  We could hear and see the planes, but, not this other object in the sky.

 Note:  It was moving laterally to its length across the sky.

The launch was the last to take place from pad 36A at the cape and marks an end to an era.

The launch took place at 7:17 EDT (23:17 GMT) and seperation took place 73 minutes later , marking about the exact time for the reported anomolous object to appear in the eastern sky.

On Tuesday August 31 from approximately 9pm eastern time to 9:15pm my wife and I observed from our front porch in central-upstate New York (approximately 42N, 76W) a flying object EXACTLY identical in appearance to the one in the second sketch on your web site (the sketch that's accessible by clicking on the ""Click here for a more detailed graphic"" link off of today's FLASH report on your home page).

 It was a perfectly clear, entirely cloudless and starry night, more than one hour past sunset and just a quarter-hour after moonrise. I first noticed the object relatively low and distant in the sky as I looked to the west-southwest. It appeared well above the treeline as a white, somewhat fuzzy, oval-shaped splotch in the sky, about the size of an aspirin at arm's length. After staring at it for a full minute, it also seemed to be moving extremely slowly toward me. As a lifelong stargazer and skywatcher, it caught my attention due to its relatively large size, its relative brightness in the night sky, and the fact that, for me, if didn't fit any category of previously observed aerial phenomena.

 I yelled to my wife and grabbed two optics -- an 8x20 monocular and 16x50 binoculars. By this time we were certain that the object was slowly moving toward us. As I viewed it for at least 15 minutes through the 16x binoculars, it never changed its shape from the one shown in the sketch I previously referenced -- its appearance was that of two large, equal-sized parabolic shapes that were back to back but slightly separated and linked through their middles by a somewhat cigar-shaped element that was slightly pointier at the left (south-facing) end. These shapes appeared to be gaseous, almost cloudlike in nature, but they were sufficiently defined and unchanging.

 As I looked through the 16x binoculars, I also saw an occasionally-blinking white light at the left tip of the cigar-shaped central element. It blinked at an  irregular rate, and my wife could not see this aspect of it through the 8x monocular. At one point midway through our roughly 15-minute observation period, I also saw (through the binoculars) a yellow-red dot that moved quickly toward the south; it originated from the same tip where the white light was periodically blinking. I could only track the low-intensity yellow-red light briefly through the binoculars' field of view before it vanished; I could not see this light with my naked eye.

 The dual-parabolic-shaped object's line of travel took it directly over my house at a high altitude. As it slowly approached the point directly overhead, the object also had begun to lose its shape, size, and intensity of luminosity. When it was directly overhead, the object ceased to exist, although I continued to observe this overhead location for another 30 minutes and could still (but barely) make out a faint amorphous form in its place. At this point, and all throughout the observing period, there were still no clouds in the sky, and we heard no sounds from the object. There were occasional commercial aircraft traversing the sky at various altitudes, but none had any interaction or effect on this object, which was at an unknown but seemingly high altitude. I did not see any reports in this morning's (Wednesday) local daily newspaper. I don't know if it was mentioned on any local radio or TV stations.

Initially, the bar was bright with two brighter areas at each end and the light was compact.  As it slowly and steadily moved upward toward the eastern sky, it dissipated into a fainter cloud til it was no longer visible (~30 degrees above the western sky).

I and a partner were attending a concert/water display at Longwood Gardens. We were coming out of the plant Conservatory shortly before 9pm EST when two Security Guards approached us asking if we had any idea what ""that"" was. He pointed above the trees, about 45 degrees up to a fuzzy but distinct patch of light approximately a degree in diameter. As an experienced amature astronomer my first impression was that it was the moon heavily obscured by clouds. I dismissed that idea since the moon would have been just rising in the east and this object was only a few degrees SW of corona borealis. Plus the sky was completely cloud free. I said to the guards that I was baffled and had never seen anything like it before. It resembled a comet but without a tail.

 At first it appeared stationary. The water display began, but I was more interested in this object and kept checking it out throughout the display. It passed through corona borealis slowly in a straight line. I would guess it moved about a degree a minute. As it moved it changed shape from what appeared to be elongated to more or less spherical. It also gradually and steadily diminished in brightness. I continued to track it until about 9:25 PM EST by which time I could no longer detect it. By that time it was entering the constellation Cygnus which was high overhead. The object never changed speed or course. It was probably visible well before it was pointed out to me. Other people in the crowd were looking up occasionally but as the water display continued they seemed to have lost interest in it.

I had gotten off work at 3am,  I am a nurse, and was working at a local hospital. When I got home I found I had forgotten to leave a set of keys to the drug cabinet, that were in my pocket.  I changed clothes and headed back to the hospital.  As I was merging onto I-17 frwy, there were at least 3 to 5 other vehicles in close proximity to mine. When all of a sudden from the north west corner of the sky a bright green circular object quickly passed overhead in front of me headed towards the southeast. Being exactly one week from the 9/11 event, when this object first caught my attention, I thought that maybe it was a missile attack being directed at the city.  Apparently, the other drivers that saw it did too, because we all slammed on our brakes.  What I thought was strange about this thing was that it's color never changed in intensity, or faded like you might see with a meteor coming through the atmosphere.

At Approximately 8:27 PM EDT, Tuesday, October 12, 2004, I stepped out of my house to check the sky for clouds, anticipating a satellite pass, when I observed a -3/-4 magnitude star-type cylindrical object moving from south-east to north-west, 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon.  At first, I thought it was the ISS (International Space Station). It appeared to have the same orangish/white color as the ISS. I then noticed it had a haze or glow around it, and was LARGER in relative size than the ISS. The object tracked on a path similar to a satellite, but did not ""Feel"" the same. It dissappeared over the horizon to the north. The conditions were CAVU: Ceiling And Visibility Unlimited, with a sodium vapor street light 300 feet to my relative west. After checking the Marshall Space Flight Center's J-Pass Web Site (http://science.nasa.gov/RealTime/JTrack/3D/JTrack3D.html) for satellite overflights and found none near Florida, I called MacDill AFB in Tampa. The Duty Officer said they had no information on any missile tests or other activities, and would log my call.

I'm so glad I found this site.  I was born and raised in Honolulu, and have spent a lot of time outdoors looking at the night sky.  I am sober; I don't use any drugs and seldom drink.  Over the years I have seen a quite a few things I could not explain in the skies above Oahu. I'm glad to have a place to share them here.  At the times these things happened I was either alone, or with one person and it was wierd not to be able to talk about them.

 ABOUT THE TIMES AND DATES, THE FORM HERE DOESN'T FIT.  THESE THINGS OCCURED BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 1994 AND THE PRESENT AND VARIOUS TIMES AND LOCATIONS ON OAHU.  MOST WERE ONLY WITNESSED BY ME BUT ONE OR TWO WERE WITNESSED BY OTHERS.

 First of all the most recent thing was in the ocean outside Waikiki.  This occured approximately around 2002 or 2003.  On more than one occasion, I saw lights I could not explain in the ocean outside of Waikiki.  I saw these from Kaimana beach on the eastern end of Waikiki at the foot of Diamond Head.  There were yellow lights.  They did not behave either like airplaces or boats.  They were above the water. If I remember correctly they looked like flares (Although they were much larger, larger and brighter than stars or airplanes).  Their movements made no sense.  If I remember correctly, they burned brightly in one place and then sank slowly and disappeared before they hit the water.  They were perhaps a mile or more out to sea, seemingly directly out from Kaimana.  I saw these bright yellow lights on more than on occasion.  If I remember correctly there were more than one in a row.  My friend, a social worker, also saw then and we were freaked out.

 Perhaps around 1994 I saw the most spectacular thing.  It was twilight at Queen's surf in Waikiki.  To the West, out to sea from Makakilo and Waianae, hundreds of feet up in the sky, I saw a spectacular display.  Fluorescent green squiggles appeared high in the sky, one after another.  They would fade and more would appear.  This went on for a while.  It looked like someone air brushing designs on a T-shirt.  This was NOT the ""green flash"" people sometimes see in Hawaii after the sunset.  In spite of the fact that thousands of people should have seen this, I found no mention of it in the media, and I checked. I think I also checked somewhere like Bishop Museum which has astronomers and people like that.  No one else reported it.  One friend speculated that it must have been was rockets or missiles launched from the military base on Kauai [which would probably be Barking Sands].  This occurance was spectacular,unmistakeable, distinct and went on for a while.

 At other times, I've seen lights in the night sky that seem to behave in odd ways if they were to be aircraft.  This could be their movement, or brightness.  Most of these I've seen from Kahala or near Sandy Beach.  Perhaps some from Waikiki.  I don't remember the details that much now, just thinking, that light isn't moving correctly for an airplane, or it looks too big.  If I remember correctly most were yellow light, or perhaps white.

 Somewhere in the early or mid nineties, I saw the most incredible sights at Waimanalo beach in eastern Oahu.  These may well all be natural.  I just thought they were spectacular.  On this particular day, I saw an awesome rainbow coming straight down from a cloud to the sea.  About sunset, which was taking place on the other side of a mountain range, a sight appeared in the eastern sky about where the sun rises.  This on the horizon was over the water.  Black rays emanated from this spot, like a reverse sunset.  Lots of people saw it, they just looked transfixed, but no one said anything, strangely. Combined with the rainbow and something else I've forgotten, the energy was intense that day.  It was special.  I would be grateful to know what that was, if anyone knows.

 Then, between about 2000 and 2002, I saw one more thing.  I was near Punchbowl.  It was probably between about 3 and 5 in the afternoon.  This cloud came overhead, but it was not like any cloud I have ever seen.  It seemed unusually radiant and important.  It resembled a city in the sky.  I was transfixed by it.  I remember I wanted to call an aquaintance who is spiritually sensitive and religious because I thought she too would understand that something was afoot.  I don't think that was an ordinary ""cloud.""  I've wondered in it concealed a UFO, or something else.

 That's all I can specifically remember at this time.  I've noticed other reports on this site of strange lights over the ocean outside of Waikiki that are like my stories.

After a surf we were hosing off outside and we heard the H.B. police helicopter buzzing above us wildly.  It usually just cruises around but this time it was in a cat and mouse game with an object that was about the size of a car.  I have perfect vision and a rather extensive background in aviation.

We could make out all of the features of the copter but the object appeared to be like two clamshells together in a golden metallic color with possibly some blackish horizontal stripes.  It was pulling off some fantastic manuevers that looked impossible!  The chopper couldn't come close to it. 

My hairs on my neck stood up and I felt that this is not of this world!  It also had no lights and no sound.  It was almost dusk outside.I yelled to my girlfriend to get the videocam but she was too late. 

Also, there is an electric plant nearby and it flew around it twice before it shot off like a bullet with the copter in pursuit.  I was a bit sceptical about this stuff until this happened, but now I know for sure something's going on here-if it was our govt., they wouldn't be testing something over houses!

While driving down Range Rd just after passing the RT93 overpasses, myself and my passenger ((name deleted)), observed a basketball sized bright orange colored glowing ball stationary on the road near were the farm was, (now soccer fields I believe). It was approx 3 ft off the tar. I saw it clearly from approx 300 ft away and it came towards my vehicle at a rapid rate of speed. All the time maintaning the same height off the road, 3ft. It seemed intelligent due to the fact that it followed the contour of the road perfectly, as the road was slightly curvy and hilly. As it past by me within 3 ft I noticed no sounds or extra illumination or smells inside my truck. It traveled very fast. Immediately afterwards I asked ((name deleted)) what he saw. He said a glowing ball in the road that came towards us. Just 1000' ahead on Range rd were about 4 or 5 adults waiting to see the start of the fireworks at Canobie lake park. I wish I had asked them if they had seen anything unusual. But I did'nt stop. I had ((name deleted)) to collaberate what I saw that July 4th, 1992 evening 12 years ago. It was not flaming like a ""Roman Candle"" balland was not hot or burning or changing colors like fireworks. If this thing had not come so close and just gone the other way, I would have brushed it off and dismissed and forgotten it. But the behavior was undoubtly intelligent as it followed the road like a ""Cruise missile"" you could say.

During a KWGN news show about NORAD (Cheyenne mountain - Colorado Springs, CO), the camera was pointed at the female t.v. journalist. To her side, and behind her was a bulletin board with the words: ""800 unknowns tracked last year"", or words very close to that.

 I've tried to contact KWGN in Denver, but to no avail. I don't know if they knew the camera was on that bulletin board or not, but, for just a few seconds (maybe 20 to 30) were the words that haunt me.

 NORAD tracks ALL debris, aircraft, spacecraft, spacejunk, anything that flys or is in orbit around the planet. For those words to be where they were, is paramount to saying the AIR FORCE admits they can NOT identify at least 800 bogies in a year. That says a LOT. Although it is not proof positive of ""FLYING SAUCERS"", it is a far cry from the hardline statements that UFO's are ""swamp gas, clouds, meteors, or imagination"".

 Hope maybe you could dig deeper and find out if they still have the tape of that special on Cheyenne Mountain. It aired in May of 1995 as I recall.

My father told me, a week later that he was standing outside about 1 a.m. scanning the hills in the full moon, which was behind him.  He noticed a large missile shape with two smaller missile shapes attached on each side, standing on end atop the adjacent hill.  It looked to be made of a yellowish metal in the moonlight. As he watched, it went up, without lights or sound, up into a cloud which was black. Then he got cold and went back into the house. It was about 23 degrees and crystal clear out.  The 'cloud' was oddly black since it was not silouetted against the moon but should have been lit by it.

My wife (at the time age 21 a receptionist at the Stanford business park) and I (age 29 a marketing administration manager for a national medical instrumentation company)were about to do some Christmas shopping in what was then called the ""White Front Store"".

 After parking the car, I happened to glance up to observe very low hanging clouds and peeking out from one such cloud was a triangular shaped portion of a craft just exposing enough area to include a large observation window. Of particular note was the rootbeer metalic color of the craft. I have since seen such metalic colored material on 5 inch wide ribbon cabling used on experimental micro wave missiles. This area is very near a military airbase. Moffett field.

 The craft remained motionless and no noise was heard. It was as if it was hovering very still as observations were being made. After approx 10 minutes of viewing the craft, I went into the store. When I returned 45 minutes later, it was gone.

I was out surfing and it was a weekend day. Often airplanes will fly fairly low over the surfers just to check us out on the weekends.  I was at a surf spot called ""sharks"" which is near the ""Hook"" a surf spot that is directly at the end of 41st avenue which runs from Highway 1 to the cliffs at the Pacific.  We were sitting there and we looked up because there was a twin engine conventional aircraft approaching at about 1,000 feet and below it and moving much slower was a triangular craft small at about 500 feet and approximately the size of a hang-glider except that it had firm trailing edges and there was no bow in the wing as there is in hang-gliders.  Additionally this craft was completely silent and about 2-3 feet thick. It looked too thin to have held a human and there was no landing gear. This craft had 2 props located approximately 3 feet from the left and right tips of the triangle. It was white with no other markings.  It flew directly overhead and the continued to go at the same altitude directly over the land. At this point the twin engine conventional craft banked off to its left to avoid going over the land at a low altitude. Before and after the conventional craft came and went the triangle traveled at about 30 miles per hour and was completely quiet.  One surfer said to me ""what the hell was that?"" I replied that it looked like and unmanned aerial vehicle.  The other two surfers said nothing.  Most of the time us surfers prefer not to talk to each other at all.  It is not like a friendly atmosphere with other surfers as we are basically competing for the best waves and there is more hostility out there than friendliness if any conversation at all. A few days later I called the nearest airport which I believe was in Monterey and I spoke with an air traffic controller.  I questioned him about the legal altitudes for aircraft over water and I believe he said that it is 100 ft. over the water and 300 ft. over the land but I am not sure of those numbers.  The reason I asked this question is because of the fact that the twin engine banked off when the craft went inland.  It looked to me that the twin engine had seen the craft and was buzzing it from above to see what it was.  The air traffic controller said that he had not recieved any other reports but asked me to report to him if I saw it again.  As an important side note; my brother-in-laws father worked at Lockheed Missiles and space in Silicon Valley and also in L.a.  In L.A. he worked at the skunkworks as a purchasing agent and he was buying wooden hand made props for  unmanned aerial vehicles that he said were powered by chainsaw engines that had exhaust systems installed to make them perfectly quiet.  He said they used wood props because they were only 2 feet long and made by some obscure small time person who could shape them the way they needed to be effective and also quiet.  The craft I saw looked too thin to hold a human although if the human was lying down in the prone position perhaps he could fit inside.  What amazes me is that the military would fly such a craft over heavily populated areas on a weekend in Monterey Bay and over land too. It was interesting but looked very much man-made.-((name deleted))","Licensed Psychiatric Technician",4,1,"triangle",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2002,2000,2,5,14,"Afternoon","West",0,1,0,0,0

I was coming back home from church after New Year's Service. I was on the S-101 Freeway. My car was the only vehicle on the freeway at the time. Suddenly, mr car stopped. I stepped out and looked around to see if anyone could give me a jumpstart. Suddenly, I heard weird pinging sounds. I looked up and saw three saucers zipping through. There were green trails where the aircrafts had flown by. They were in a tight triangular formation. Suddenly, four or five more saucers in loose formation shot out from the clouds after the previous UFOs (which I think they were). Suddenly, a light shot out from one of the pursuiting crafts after the ones that had previously zipped by. It hit one, and it instantly blew up. When the green phosphorous light caused by what I think was a missile cleared, there was no more light there. From the rear, more missiles shot out. One of the lead UFOs took a sharp banking turn (the light started dimming, which I think means he turned away) and the missile just continued on its path. The other one took a critical hit, and the same thing happened. There was nothing else. The four or five planes in the back seemed to have disappeared because it didn't glow anymore, but later, I saw flashing lights, which I think were indicator lights. Therefore, I concluded that only the first three planes were UFOs.

I got to say, that in the past I have been very impressed by the integrity of your reports.  However, having only glanced through the January reports, I read TWO that were obviously hoaxes: (1/15/05) Las Vegas, and the dancing disco balls!, plus (1/1/05) North Hollywood writer states he/she witnessed a UFO dogfight!  Come on!  Please screen you emails a little better.  You have an AMAZING website, and your standards are usually top notch.  Thank you for the hard work.

On a very clear evening on a shore front pier in a cove on the Cheasapeake Bay.  Here is what was observed by myself and 4 or 5 other people.  Something I never forgot as a child.  While looking across the water as we often did in the evening, we saw 4-5 round lights hovering overhead about 2-oclock above the horizon at what appeared to be above the normal flight paths. 

As we observed these strange lights they moved eratickly to and fro for about 3 to 4 min  then suddenly and silently moved into formation similar to the way military jets would position themselves ,only these objects were not moving in any direction they remained still.  

Suddenly one by one they shot strait into space in an instant and out of sight without a sound, faster then any plane could ever move more like a bullet I'm hoping this discription triggers someone elses memory of this strange sighting after all this time.

I and fellow Marine were on guard duty at an armory on Camp Pendleton. The events that transpired that night I have only ever shared with my wife; who the other Marine has shared it with I do not know, but we never spoke of the incident or reported out of fear.  

I have been in several combat situations, but this was the most terrifying moment in my life.  I reluctantly share it now as I have tried to never think of it after I made it through that night.

We were on duty that night at the main armory for that area of base.  We had been on this post quite a lot and had become familiar with the surroundings inside and out.  We were locked into the perimeter after the last Marine that worked in the armory left, as we were every night.  We had no key for obvious security reasons.

I was the first to see it.  It crested a hill approximately eight hundred meters to the east of the armory.  I thought it strange but we were on a military base so it could be anything.  As the object moved closer I realized that it was something I was unfamiliar with and not another marine or piece of equipment.  My gut was that something was very wrong.  

At this moment I called the other Marine over to see what he thought.  We radioed in to the guard HQ but could not adequately describe whatever it was and they felt it to be no threat so the response team was not sent.  

It approached at a slow enough rate of speed that we were coming up with all kinds of explanations from hummers to snipers but as it got to within a hundred yards we realized that we were in trouble.  The trip from the top of the hill took approximately eight to ten minutes to this point.  We immediately locked and loaded and took defensive positions.

The object was not like anything I have ever seen so to compare it to anything would be pointless but I will do my best to describe it.  It was a sphere, a ball of glowing blue light.  It was not bright, it did not shine.  The best way to describe it is that it was a fluorescent blue ball of light that could move.  The glow of the light was slightly more intense in the center, but I would not say that it was the source.  It was translucent and I could see no object or anything that would lead me to believe that it was solid in anyway but it had a definite shape.  It was positioned about 15 feet above the ground and was about three to four feet in diameter.  

I don?t know if it actually got smaller as it approached because it looked larger when it was further out.  There was no sound coming from the object.  It stopped above the front gate guard shack for a few seconds and then proceeded toward the armory.  At this point I almost fired on the object but fear of what it might be and what might happen, and the thought that I was going crazy, made me wait.  From my observation I really don?t believe there was anything a bullet could have harmed.  Have no doubt that had it come closer to me I would have fired anyway.  

The object continued toward the armory until it came to a point above the center and then began to move downward.  I could not see the object actually enter the armory as the perimeter fence prevented us from moving back that far, however we knew it was in the armory because the inside of the armory began to glow the same blue color.  At this point we tried multiple times to raise someone on the radio but all attempts failed, not due to equipment malfunction, but because the ((deleted)) on the other end fell asleep.  

The glow coming out of the window on the front door seemed to get brighter and darker, so I assume it was in motion inside the armory.  Three and a half hours after I first saw the object it raised up outside the armory and continued directly upward at a much faster speed than it approached.  

We waited for a brief while and decided together not to tell anyone as we wanted to avoid the repercussions that sharing this story with anyone, especially our chain of command, would bring.  We did watch in fear as the first armory Marine showed up at 0500 and walked inside, as we had not told him what had happened.  Nothing seemed to be out of place or harmed so we kept quiet.  

This is the first time I have shared this full story as I have only told my wife that I saw something while guarding an armory that scared the shit out of me.  I can only imagine that what ever it was was checking out the weapons inside as there were thousands of them and many different types.  

No harm came to me or my fellow Marine.

 I AM POSITIVE beyond a shadow of a doubt that this was not gas, a light trick or some kind of light coming from Venus.  Believe me when I tell you I wish it was.  I was not amazed.  I was locked in a very secure fence with something that I did not feel I could protect myself from and I had no idea what it was.  I was petrified.

My sighting took place in the middle of June 1995. I do not remember the specific date. 

I was camping alone on a remote beach located about ten to fifteen miles west of the town of Cameron, located in Cameron Parish Louisiana. The beach is located about a mile off state Highway 27, which runs along the Gulf of Mexico coastline from Cameron to Port Arthur, Texas. 

I had spent the day on the beach fishing, and was spending the night. The weather was perfectly clear with no clouds and no fog. I was laying on the beach, just looking at the stars and thinking. 

At 2 a.m. I noticed an extremely bright object moving across the sky at very high speed. The object was coming in from out over the Gulf of Mexico and moving toward the beach, moving from south to north. I spend a lot of time outdoors and I am used to seeing aircraft at night. The object was moving extremely fast, much faster than I had ever seen any jet move. It's speed reminded me of a bright bullet. It was also at very high altitude, higher than what airliners normally appear to be, and seemed as if it were up among the stars. 

The object was quite bright, like a brilliant white light, and appeared to be quite large considering that it seemed to be so high. I was not able to discern any particular shape, only a very bright object. 

My first thought was that this must be a military jet of some sort, but then something very remarkable happened. While maintaining speed the object suddenly reversed direction. It did not make a turn. It did not stop and then reverse. It was as if it hit a solid wall and bounced back along the exact same course. One second it was moving north, and suddenly it was returning south along the same route in a perfectly straight line. 

I had never before seen any aircraft do that and have not seen anything like it since. Because of this amazing straight line course reversal, I am convinced that this object could not possibly have been any comet, meteor, or known aircraft. I observed the object fly out over the Gulf of Mexico until I could no longer see it. The entire incident lasted only about a minute or perhaps a little less. 

I told my sister about it, but told no one else, out of fear of ridicule. I have decided to post my sighting now, thinking that perhaps someone else may have had a similar sighting in the area. 

As for my background, I have two college degrees, am a former police officer, and at the time of the sighting was teaching biology at a local university, where I taught for six years. I was not drinking or taking drugs of any kind. I'm not making any wild claims, only reporting what I saw.","Hotel Manager",1,1,"unknown",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1995,1990,2,6,2,"Night","South",0,1,0,0,0

Not certain of date memory fades, somewhere between 1999 and 2000 on a crystal clear morning. 

I witnessed multiple contrails in the early morning traveling on a polar path from the south at extreme altitude (i.e. well above 35000'). The formation was relatively evenly spaced from western to eastern horizons and eventually disappeared over the northern horizon. Possibly, multiple missile tests? Or, b52 formations? Not sure. 

I woke wife and daughter to confirm as it looked like a massive ICBM launch based on the altitude and polar trajectory.  Possibly, from Edwards or Vandenburg?  I witnessed a similar even in the late 70's with only one trail and apparent staging which turned out to be a test launch from Vandenburg. This one has always thrown me though. 

There were just too many for a test launch. 

Calls to AFB, Airport, Paper etc, turned up nothing and unlike the 1970's incident, I am unable to find any corroboration of the event on the internet.  

My family and I can't possibly be the only ones to have seen this!

They had no markings, perfectly metallic with a parting line on the center circumference, purplish color on the bottom and silver on the top, about the length of a 727.  

We quickly ruled out earthly origin.  They stopped above the platform, then without turning, went southeast about 1/4 mile, hovered, reversed and came back to a stationary position above the platform.   During this time, Navy frogmen in wetsuits were attempting to enter a rubber raft at the base of the platform but after seeing the craft, they climbed back up the ladder of the platform and re-entered.  

In about two seconds, the craft 'bulleted' away at about a 45 degree angle back toward the same southerly approach direction and were invisible.   A few seconds later, two phantom jets, apparently from Tyndal AFB in Panama City, roared at about 100' over our boat and ""chased"" the craft at the direction and angle of ascent as the craft had departed.  The impression I had was of a puppy trying to catch a speeding car.  I had recently been discharged as an ROTC Army Officer and my brother from the Coast Guard.  If I'd had my recently purchased SLR camera with its 210mm telephoto lens, given that most of the time we were 300-400' from these craft, there would be little doubt today of the existence of UFO's.

 To me, the object looked like a rocket, as it was flying low enough that I was sure it had no wings. However, it was not flying vertically [i.e. flying up]; rather, it was flying horizontally, parallel with the ground, as you would watch an airplane or helicopter flying over. Again, there were no wings and no helicopter blades that I could see. The object was cigar-shaped like a rocket or missile, even though it was flying over land instead of up.

 Like an airplane, the object simply flew over. Within a half-minute or less, it was gone. I assume the object must have made some type of sound [although I do not remember the sound], that caught my attention so I looked up to see it.

 I cannot give an exact date, but it was seen sometime between the middle of June and the middle of August in 1966. This is when I was attending a summer camp at the Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania, about fourteen miles west of Philadelphia.

 The time of day was, as I recall, late afternoon.

 At that time, I was standing near one of the barracks/dormitories {I believe it may have been Wheeler Hall] of the Valley Forge Military Academy. I believe this was the barracks where my dormitory room was located.

 At the time, I was ten years old; I would turn eleven in the Autumn.

 I did not notify anyone of the siting. It went so fast, I had no time to call anyone. And, since the vehicle was gone after a few moments, it did not seem to be of much value to tell anyone.

 Since the object looked like a rocket or missile, I assumed it was of terrestrial origin. However, I did wonder why a rocket or missile was flying over suburban Philadelphia.

The others looked up but did not want to believe me that this was a classic and very real ufo!  They tried to explain it away as a balloon or blimp of some kind, even though there was no gondola attached and the object moved purposefully in a very straight line.  

The craft was approximately 500 to 1000 ft high and I'm estimating that it was about the size of a standard passenger bus.  It was metallic, shiny and reflected the sun on it's surface but it was a semi-dull shine, and not of mirror reflecting quality.  

On the surface of the object were two lines that seperated it into 3 sections:  pointed nose section, middle and rear.  There were no other distinguising features on the object either; no windows or door apertures could be seen.

Nearly a year ago, on the evening of April 8, 2004, I was standing in my backyard patio looking at the clear night sky when I observed 2 big, bright, yellowish-amber lights hanging in the southwestern sky approximately 35 degrees above the horizon. 

At first I couldn't figure out which 'planets' these were being so bright and below the orbital plane of the planetary solar system. These objects were much brighter than the apparent magnitude of Venus and of course a different color. I then located ice-blue Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and maybe either Uranus or Mercury - they were all where they should have been. 

Then I thought they must be 2 hovering helicopters but being that bright they would have to be very close and I should be able to hear them.  These lights never made a sound the whole time. My son, unbeknownst to me at the time, had been standing in the street in front of my house to get better reception from the cell phone as he was calling his aunt and uncle in Richland, WA. 

He saw these same 2 lights climb out of the southwestern horizon (which I had not) and then stop and hover. He too was puzzled and described the phenomenon to his aunt while still on the phone.  He then walked through the house and into the back patio to tell me but as I have said, I was already watching them at that point. 

As we looked, the left light only receded back down toward the southwest to approximately 20 degrees above the horizon, stopped, and hovered there for about 2-3 minutes. Then, on its way back up to join the other light, it emitted what looked like 3-4 streams of sparkling lights or projectiles that reminded me of tracer bullets or Roman candles. 

For an instant, it scared me so my heart stopped as I truly thought we were under some sort of attack. (Too many war and space movies I guess!)   Now the left light had rejoined the other one and they both just hung there.  

I went inside the house and got my binoculars which revealed the big, bright, amber lights, both left and right, to be actually 4 steady, separate lights on the corners of a perfect square.   These two bright amber lights, continued to hang there for about 4 more minutes then the left light began climbing up the sky until it was directly overhead (12 o?clock position).  It moved at about the apparent speed of a satellite but it was obviously no satellite as it was a hell of a lot closer, bigger, and brighter.  

When it got to the 1 o?clock position on its northeasterly course, the lights instantly disappeared as if being turned of by a switch.  

When I went back to look for the right light, it was gone.  My son said he had watched it depart on a course 90 degrees to the other light, in a northwesterly direction.  He said it appeared to drop a couple of tiny red dots vertically downward and then it too suddenly disappeared.  Neither my son, who is a college graduate, nor I was able to explain this phenomenon to each other.

In the ensuing days, I scoured the newspapers and watched the TV news but not a peep mentioning anything about this.   I asked several fellow pilots in my flying club, and after some joking at my expense of course, none had observed anything as they were inside their houses that night.  I also called the Traffic Control Tower at Buchanan Field in Concord, CA several days later and no one had observed it.  

What really boggles my mind is the fact that in a large metropolitan area of several million people,  you?d think at least a few people would be outside their houses looking up at the night sky to see this phenomenon, and knowing this could not be explained as ?conventional aircraft, satellites, or planetary behavior?, would therefore report it to someone.  Of course, neither did I, officially, until now.  

This has been on my mind for almost a year now, and it wasn?t until I saw the Peter Jennings Special on UFOs a few days ago that I learned of your site for reporting this sort of phenomenon.

In 1965 I was 21 years old and worked for GE in Utica N.Y. in the radio receiver department.  I earned a two year degree in Electronic Technology after I graduated from high school in 1962 and went to work for GE.  Later I worked for AT&T at a Microwave Relay Station.  AT&T transfered me to a Satellite Earth Station where I worked for 17 more years.  I retired from AT&T after 32 years service.  I have never smoked a cigarette, never did drugs, and I have never a had a beer in my life.  I have two daughters, one is an OBGYN doctor and the other is a speech pathologist.  They have had to listen to this account since they were old enough to understand it.  

This is what happened, nothing has been added to make a better ""story""!  What follows is the truth as I lived it.  

It was Sunday night and I am not sure of the exact date.  I was returning to Utica, N.Y., where I lived, after a weekend home with my parents in the Loyalsock Creek area of Pennsylvania.  I had just purchased my new TR-4 car and was going north on Route 87 about 21:00 at night.  About an hour into the trip, I noticed some lights off to the right of the road.  I traveled this route many times and knew that the only thing in that direction was an empty field and what we call a mountain here in Pennsylvania.  The lights made me curious because they were red and green and flashing like the old railroad crossing once did.  The only difference was one side was green and the other was red.  If I had to describe the colors for someone, I would say they were ""Christmas Red and Green"".  

I slowed down and looked right and decided I had plenty of time so I would stop and satisfy my curiosity.  My first thought was that I was looking at someone working on the mountain side, maybe cutting lumber, but that didn't fit.  Next I thought it could be a helicoptor, but this was 1965 and we just didn't see that many of them.  I stopped my TR-4 in my lane of a two lane highway.  This was a very remote area at that time and I wasn't worried about traffic.  I looked at the lights and wondered just what this could be?  

It was about 200 yards away from me and looked to be about 100 feet up the hill.  I shut off my car and let the headlights on so if that rare bit traffic would approach, they would be able to see me.  A Triumph is very small so I was able to reach over and roll down the window without getting out of the drivers seat.  I leaned over and put my arms on the open window and turned my head to hear what sound was coming from the lights.  No noise at all, except for the sounds of the October night.  I looked at the red and green flashing light and wondered just what was going on over on the hill.  I can't remember which side was green and which side was red.  As I sat in my car trying to figure out just what it was, that I was looking at, I became aware that it wasn't on the mountain side, like I first thought, but in front of the hill and above the field.  This soon became very clear to me because what I was looking at had started to move.  One thing people have the ability to do is determine if someing coming towards them is going to go left or right or directly at them.  The lights were coming directly at me at about 50 feet above the field.  I remember thinking ""Wow what is that"", when I became aware of two very obvious conditions.  

First, this thing was 50 feet up in the air and was moving very slowly directly towards me!  Second, it was completely silent!  No noise at all!  I remember thinking that nothing that size could be in the air and moving towards me without making any noise, it just isn't possible.  It was about 50 feet wide and 10 feet high, I would guess.  And I hate to say it because this is the point when people start walking away, but it was saucer shaped.  

I watched it approach me until I realized that it was coming very slowly directly at me and it wasn't a blimp or helicoptor or plane or anything else that I have ever seen.  At that age we tend not to be afraid of anything and think that we are 10 feet tall and bullet proof.  It took a lot to get me afraid in those days.  

At that point I started to think that I wasn't in a good spot since this thing was very slowly going to be right on top of me in a very short time.  Whatever I was watching was also watching me!  I decided to get out of there fast!  I rolled up the window and started up my TR-4 and put it in first gear and stepped on it!  I just had time to put it in second gear when I realized that there was, what I thought at the time, another one directly in front of me.  It was just off to the side of the road above the guard rail and about the height of a telephone pole.  I thought, there are two of them!  I quickly looked back to the center of the field to find the other one and it wasn't there.  I realized that the one I had been watching move so very slowly towards me had moved about 150 yards and came to a complete stop in about 3 seconds.  There it was with those red and green lights flashing and it was only about 50 feet above the road.  I looked back and forth again, yes it was the only one.  It couldn't have moved that far and that fast and been able to stop in 3 seconds.  It did all of that and never made a noise, complete silence!  All except one noise, my heart was beating so fast and hard that I could feel it in my throat.  

I have never been that frightened in my life before or after that night.  My first thought was to hit the brakes and not drive under it.  It didn't take me long to figure out that if I hit the brakes and stopped I would end up parked directly under it.  I made a quick decision to shift to the next gear and drive under it.  I remember looking out my windshield at this metal object with the green and red flashing lights as I drove under it!  I drove the next few hours to Utica without looking into my rear view mirror!  I don't know if I was so frightened that it would be following me or if I had just been that shook up.  One thing was clear, for some reason I wasn't going to look into my rear view mirror for any reason and I didn't. 

I have a few regrets in my life, like most people, but the one that is at the top of my list is that I drove away.  I wish today that I would have gotten out of the car and waited for whatever it was to get to me, at least I would have known exactly what it was.  Very few months of my life have gone by that I didn't think about what it was and what happened that night.  I was within 50 feet of this object.  I had a really good look at it.  It wasn't a reflection from an airport 500 miles away.  It wasn't swamp gas!  It wasn't a star or the moon!  It was real and fast and silent and close.  And yes the one that makes me feel the worst is when someone looks at me and claims that I made it all up or that it was a dream that I remember or some other total nonsense.  

Very strange isn't it, we both think that the other is talking total nonsence!  One thing is certain, nothing back then could do what that object did and nothing today can do it either.  And unless some government has had some really great technology that they have kept secret, it didn't come from earth.  

Many years back I was having my yearly physical and at the end of it my doctor asked me if anything was bothering me or if I had any problems.  I looked at him and said yes I do have something that has bothered me all my life.  Out came the whole account of the events just as I have written here.  I asked the doctor if he could use some method to take me back to that night to find out if anything more had happened?  He asked me if I had trouble sleeping or working and if I was happy?  I said no and everything was great.  He said that's the reason I won't do anything.  It could only harm you.  He said ""I believe every word that you have just told me and I wouldn't tell anybody what you have just told me"".  

I didn't speak about it for many years but I am 60 years old now and I just have this feeling that I would like someone else to know the secret that I am convinced of.  I hope I don't end up wishing I had followed the doctors advice.  A lot of people wonder if something very strange is going on, it is!  The problem is, there are so many nut cases out there that nobody believes it when they hear the real thing.  When I think about it, what a wonderful way to cover up what is going on, just keep putting out stupid accounts or faked pictures and movies and soon nobody will believe the truth when they hear it.

I live in San Pedro, CA around 3rd and Gaffey up from the harbor. Last night I was standing on my back porch which faces in a westerly direction. I was making a crude star chart to research and i.d. some of the constellations I could see. It was a beautiful, clear night with a few small clouds and a nice crescent moon. I was fairly intent on the sky trying to make sure I got the major stars in their proper position. The time is approximately 8:30 PM. As I?m looking up I see off to my right 2 glowing orbs moving directly together at what had to be a high rate of speed. They were moving in a very straight line in a generally south west direction side by side, closely together. Their path from horizon to horizon took maybe 4 to 5 seconds and then they, for a lack of better words, disappeared. The objects appeared to be glowing and were orange in color. If I had to guess at their size from my viewpoint, I?d say about the size of dimes, maybe more oval than perfectly round. I have an amateurs interest in astronomy and have done lots of star gazing over the years. I?ve seen meteor showers, comets, missile launches, etc. This was like none of those. After they passed, I was a little shaken, not quite sure what I had just seen. I walked back in and called a friend. I had to share this with someone! After I got off the phone I walked back out and was staring to the skies, a little stunned. After about 5 minutes (approx. 8:45) to my amazement I see another group of those glowing lights, this one containing a fairly tight cluster of maybe 5. These were higher and looked a lot smaller. These were moving  in a more westerly direction and their passage lasted maybe 3 seconds. These appeared to be flying higher or further away, so I couldn?t comment on shape, but they definitely had that same orange glow. I go back in call my friend again. I come back out and continue to stare at the skies in amazement. I guess about 10-15 minutes later, (around 9:00) I see one more cluster, maybe 6 or 7 of this time, moving at about the same position and direction as the second cluster. I continued to scan the sky for maybe 20 minutes more, but didn?t see anything else after that. I went in and made some notes and drew a picture of what I saw on the ?star chart? I was making. I?ve been checking the news and the internet, hoping to find something that would explain this sighting, but haven?t seen anything other than similar sightings from different times in the past. I called the local police station to see if possibly there were other reports or info. they might have. They directed me to call NASA, which I haven?t done but may. I was really hoping there would be a logical explanation for this incident, but haven?t found it yet. Any help, comments or collaboration anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I am a college educated, Vice President of a corporation.  I am the most normal (and skeptical) person I know.  I was by the downtown courthouse (in my car) approaching a traffic signal, when what appeared to by a stealth bomber (triangular shaped and silver colored) flew in front of me and flew off through the buildings.  It was silent and very low.  I would have completely missed it if I weren't looking in its exact direction.  Hellicopters don't even fly this low within the city.

((COMMENT FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC SITE))

Dear Mr. Davenport,

Thank you so very much for all that you do to help our global community.  I have been a regular to your site for some time now and this is my first time posting a report.  However,  what I saw and confirmed on April 12th, 2005 forced me to share this with the center in the hopes it will added to the database as a footnote.  

Currently the database has 2 reports of a flying triangle over the Los Angeles and Santa Monica area on April 12th at approx. 13:00  (1 o'clock p.m.)  What our 2 witnesses were observing was the B-2 Stealth Bomber performing a low altitude fly-by of Dodger Stadium for the opening day ceremonies.  I observed the B-2 at approx. 13:07 from my backyard as it headed west towards Santa Monica at very low altitude approx. 700 to 900 ft. , roughly the same altitude as LAPD helicopters, and bank towards the north Santa Monica Mountains.  I tried to get a shot of this amazing airplane with my cell phone camera but I was too slow. What caught my attention was the engine noise.  Nothing like I've ever heard before.   My next door neighbor also witnessed the fly-by.  I live in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, roughly half way between the witness in downtown and the witness to my west  in Santa Monica.

 
Quote from the Los Angeles Times 4/13/05
""The largest crowd ever at Dodger Stadium - 55,892 - barely had time to settle after watching the obligatory B-2 stealth bomber roar past when low-flying projectiles began doing damage. Starter Jeff Weaver gave up 11 hits and eight runs before being pulled after a Pedro Feliz homer.""

An airshow  message board also noted the B-2 fly-by for the Dodgers opener, and noted there will be another on Memorial Day May 30th, 2005.  Let's see how many reports come in that day.

Sincerely,

I was outside walking east on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica (near Los Angeles) and saw and heard a flat triangular object that was dark gray heading north.  It was making a loud engine noise.  It was not going very fast, kind of cruising.  I thought it looked strange, but not so strange that it was beyond human technology.  It was my impression that it was some sort of plane created by man.

 Another person was walking toward me, and he had seen it too, and joked to me that it must have been a stealth plane.  If I held a baseball at arm's length, that is about the size of what I saw.

 Even though I thought it was strange, I wouldn't assume it was a UFO.  But then I heard this object mentioned on the Jeff Rense show, and Peter Davenport and Jeff requested witnesses to describe it, so I have done so.

CASE BACKGROUND   On 15April05 the Georgia UFO Group received a call on the 'Hotline'. The caller identified himself by name and address i.e. a middle-age disabled resident of McDonough Georgia (McDonough is about 26 miles SE of Atlanta). He stated that the previous night he, along with his wife and a neighboring couple, had observed a highly unusual object in the sky. He went on to describe the event (duration about one hour), indicating that he was pretty amazed by what they observed. After getting the basic details, this investigator instructed the Primary Witness (PW) to prepare a detailed account, plus a sketch, both to be forwarded to this writer. PW also provided the phone number of the second witness (W2).

  This investigator phoned W2 and found him to be a retired firefighter, and afterwards a hospital security officer by profession. He provided basic details of the event and also agreed to forward an account and a sketch to GUFOG.

  After receiving all of the above described documents on 18April05, this writer again spoke with the PW and W2 within a few days.

The final detailed account summary contains more information than the preliminary recap sent to GUFOG members in the group's bulletin.

  WITNESS ACCOUNTs- SUMMARY   PW stated that at about 10:00PM on 14April05 (and continuing until about 11:00PM) he observed what he thought was a ""falling star"" out of his bay window. When it did not briefly extinguish as expected, he went outside to observe more closely. Looking to the NW, he continued to watch a brilliant light which began to dart back and forth, up and down, zig-zagging at about 1/2 of the way off of the horizon. PW retrieved his binoculars (10X50) and continued to watch. Under magnification, he at first observed a ""pancake-like"" object which seemed to have red, blue, and silver lights on the bottom. During subsequent observation, it seemed to get closer and MOVE to give a view of DIFFERENT SHAPES......a triangle, later a shallow ""C"" shape almost like a boomerang, then a classic lens shape with a protuberance similar to a cupola, each profile displaying the aforementioned lights. PW indicated that the rapid movement reminded him of the electronic indicator on a heart monitor in a hospital, but after he thought on it some more, perhaps looking through the binoculars had caused some of that due to his natural hand and arm tremor.

  After steady observation, the PW called his neighbor, W2, who also came out to take a look.

  W2 told this investigator that he watched the object both with the naked eye and the binoculars. He estimated that it was about the size of a LARGE MARBLE held out AAL, at about 45 degrees off of the horizon, shaped like a TRIANGLE with blinking blue, green and silver lights. During his observations, he too noticed very rapid movements. PW added that it seemed to him that the object had a SHINY METALLIC-LIKE COLOR ON THE BOTTOM ALONG WITH THE CHANGING LIGHTS. During his observation using the binoculars he also noticed a GRATE-LIKE SURFACE at one point, which resembled ""criss-cross"" like openings.

W2 added that he got the impression that this object was beyond our atmosphere and would be HUGE in order to allow for what they observed.

  Local conditions during the observation was a typical mild, clear, Southern spring night, tending to the cool 50's and 60's, with little or no wind noticed.

  INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS   This writer is intrigued by the many shapes attribute to one object over the course of an hour's observation. However there is a similar recent report on file from the same general area, to wit;   On 3Aug04 at about 5:15AM, a Stockbridge Georgia resident (Stockbridge is about 8.7 miles NW of McDonough) reported to GUFOG via 'Hotline' that he was watching an UNUSUAL LIGHT back in the direction of MCDONOUGH. Said light darting up and down, back and forth, and then as the two of us spoke, he stated that it began to change into a BOOMERANG or V SHAPE. (See NUFORC entry: Stockbridge Georgia; Occurred 8/3/2004; Reported 8/10/2004; Posted 8/11/2004; Shape: Changing; Duration: Appx. 30 minutes)   OTHER FACTORS   In considering prosaic causes for this described event, celestial bodies were reviewed as should always be done for most night reports.  The planet Jupiter is brighter than normal during early April05, estimated about -2.5 magnitude, but BY MID-APRIL is actually FARTHER away from the Sun and Earth than normal.  Venus, due to it's current close proximity to the Sun, is not a factor herein.

  GUFOG Special Advisor Mark Ausmus of Atlanta reviewed the sky for 14April05 between 10:00PM and 11:00PM via his ""Starry Night"" software.  Mark found no dazzling bodies that might be brilliant enough, even if viewed through unusual atmospheric conditions, to produce anything remotely resembling what has been described.  Jupiter is off to the SE.....Saturn to the west, but less than dazzling.....Sirius to the west, up about 30 degrees, but again not a suspect.....Capella to the NW, another non-suspect in this particular circumstance.

  Witness descriptions obviously do not fit with any artificial satellites, nor meteors.  Both the PW and W2 were found to easily recognize local commercial air traffic for exactly what it is.

  Any citizens of Henry County or the south Metro Atlanta area counties with similar observations during the mid-April time frame can contact Investigator Tom Sheets at the Georgia UFO Group office in Fayetteville at 678-817-4555 or email at <<<georgiaUFOgroup@hotmail.com>>>>   GUFOG protects the identity of ALL witnesses.

Then a jet at cruise altitude heading NE began to catch up on it.  The object was definately higher than the jet.  As the jet came closer the object sped up and withing 5 seconds sort of faded away.  Those pilot had to see this.

My dad called me over to where he was standing. When I got there I looked up in the sky and saw three orange lights, two of which were moving towards each other in a slow, steady movement. The other one seemed to be covering a star. They disappeared for about four seconds and then came back for another two seconds and then disappeared again. After that they only appeared once more, but we could barely see them anymore. All that was left was a star that was underneath one of the orange lights. We then saw an aircraft fly right over where the lights had once been.

This is insane! I swear I'm crazy. To tell you the truth, I was sitting at my window... smoking a little weed. Now, I COULDNT be hallucinating. I know it was NOT laced. Anyway I see this shape. It's night but I see it. It was 3 lights, 2 grouped close in the front and 1 in the back. It was very close also, I thought it was a police chopper at first the height and  the light were too close. I see a light cutting through some fog or something. It looked like a helicopter. It swung the back around but it stayed keeping the light focused. It was light in fog not solid beam or anything. Then the 2 front lights dissappeared and left the back 1. I didnt hear any sound which is strange for how close it was. Then after 30 sec. it looked like it exploded in mid air. Around this time I kept hearing like distant gunshots and I though damn its a car chase and shootout. But the circle. It was round red with a yellow smaller circle inside of it I mean perfectly round. It looked like is stretched out fast not appeared. It stretched from nowhere. It stayed for like 20 seconds or so and I stared at it. And it was almost behing a big tree in my neighbor across the streets yard. But i could see it well. I looked away or blinked or something. it was gone but a light slowly drifted behind the tree. I had seen 4 military jets earlier in the day. MacDilll is south of us or something maybe north. not super far or anything. and it was odd. After the circle I saw jets really high up blinking red and orange. going back and forth 3 or 4 times. Then I looked over and saw otherr jets or something VERY high up to my right. I saw a plane approaching kinda low... enough to hear it and see it close. But there was no soud it went over my house. I thought it was a jet but no sound. it had 5 lights. like the shape of a f16 or such. so i sat there for like 4 minuites watching the sky. i then went outside and saw nothing. so i went inside and watched. i saw out of nowhere a shotting comet. it was like a star but huge like a comet. no sound and faded in and out fast. i watched for a while and just saw the red and orange blinking plane far in the distance. so now im writing this. I still think its crazy, but they're out there. and thos planes were the government. i swear it.

 Driving on powerline Rd.(Deerfield Beach) heading North approaching S.W. 10th ST.

Saw a Huge Fireball Streak in the due north sky about 30-40 degress up from horizon.

fireball lasted for a good 30 sec to 1 min.

I lost sight ot them for about 20 sec, Parking my car. Looked again and saw 2 Very Faint Dots Closer Together. Then as i was wondering if maybe i was looking at a plane or a star, 2 Doughnut like pulses very visible! First thought was a plane crash or a plane losing an engine. Called 911 just to report it Transfered from county to deerfield police dispatch. as I was Describing this event, the county voice interupted and said there was a shuttle launch,in which the deerfield dispach said I witnessed history. I thought cool, but i heard that the shuttle was posponed for weeks. I checked NASA.com and read report that on this day @ 10:00 am they announced that the launch will be postponed until July? I thought wierd so i wrote this. Possibly it wasn't the shuttle , just a rocket Kennendy Sapce center is North of where i live. just thought i'd give input.

A slow moving, non-blinking, white light caught my attention in the sky.  Moving North and in the NE sky about 25 degrees up.  I see planes at night all the time in the same area, in fact there were 2 planes much further south in the sky at the same time.

After watching it slowly move North on a flat plane for about 45 seconds, the light started getting brighter and then suddenly a brilliant white flash expanded from the light that looked almost identical to a perfect fireworks circle.  The expansion was fast and stayed full circle for at least 5 seconds then slowly retracted to the original light.

Then a separation occured, and the one light became two.  The second, slightly less bright was also moving in the same direction, but ever so slowly falling further behind (but staying on a flat plane).  After I could see no longer (behind trees) I quickly ran inside and checked the internet to see if the shuttle, or some other rocket had launched from Cape Canaveral.

I watched it fly overhead - bright white lights at the 3 corners of the triangle and 1 blinking red light in the ""belly.""

walking along the beach just after sunset, headed east, I looked to my right out over the ocean and saw what at first appeared to be a gigantic firework soaring, pre-explosion.  It kept going and going.  I thought, ""well, I've seen a green one similar to this and heard it was a meteor, so what is it...?""  A meteor?  (my 1st thought...)  A missile?  A bomb?  The G-8 summit was held here last summer and the FLETC headquarters are located on the mainland, in Brunswick.  I shouted to a single guy nearby, ""DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT IS?!!""  He looked at my tennis ball, as if to decipher it.  ""No, THAT!""  I pointed.  It then appeared to separate and he called it a plane.  ""Um, I've never seen a plane that looks like THAT before,"" I said.  

In foreign-accented English, he said, ""Maybe it is an army plane; it looks very big!""  By this time it had stretched into 3 much dimmer lights, with one at the head, like a triangular shape, but they were all still moving in the same direction.  We stood there in wonder and I said I was going home to look on the internet for info.  As I continued to watch it while walking away, I noticed it was now one larger glowing light moving slowly through the sky.  I was most amazed at the image of the air-patterns around it.  I wish I could draw it for you, but it was like there was an energy being generated and cut, symmetrically both above and below the object that was similar to an angel fish.  Then there was a flash that was literally like an explosion.  I thought, ""well, there's the 'fireworks' part.""  It did look very much like a small, now GREEN AND PURPLE firework that sent another circular emission of semi-lit air.  I cried out, ""What?!  WHAT?!!?""  It then returned to 2 faint lights that kept travelling in the same direction farther and farther away.  I got in my car and drove off.

Tonight me and a friend went outside to smoke cigars. As soon as we got outside I went to light my cigar and looked up at the stars, as it is a nice clear night sky. At first glance I saw only starry sky, with Venus shining brightly as it always does. Moments later I looked back up and noticed one star acting funny. It seemed to be moving very slowly, and had a glow about it. The glow was very slight, and only appeared behind it in a trianglular shape, as it appears behind meteors and such. I told my friend to look at this point. Seconds later there appeared to be an explosion of some sort, with a funnel shaped cloud resulting. The object still resembled a star at this point, just a small white circle, but moving. A second after this explosion and resulting cloud, the object slowly split into 2 objects. The objects no longer had any smoke trail or halos around it, but kept moving across the sky, very slowly. As the 2 objects moved, they traveled in the same trajectory, while the trailing object moved steadily slower than the first. After what seemed 2 to 3 minutes, the second object became noticeably more distant than the first, and also less bright. As the 2 objects made their way to the other side of the sky, the first object lost its brightness, becoming a fuzzy blur, while the second object faded then reappeared to its previous brightness. A minute later, as they passed further across the horizon, they both faded from view. It should be noted that after the explosion occured they traveled only straight across the sky, rather than downwards toward earth.

Correction!  Event date was 04/29/2005, not 04/28/2005.  Sorry!  Walking out of BJ's @ Centrum at 9:00pm tonight, I happen to glance southeast towards Jupiter when I see two small, moderately bright (say Mag 0) yellow-white lights about 3-5 moon diameters below it and one moon diameter apart. In an instant I see what at first I think is a firework explosion: a fuzzy ring of yellow-white light around the rightmost light, which expands to about 2 moon diameters in about 5 seconds, then fades out. The two lights move along a line northward, more or less parallel to the horizon, through the eastern sky. The rightmost (trailing) light is ""fuzzier"" that than the front (leftmost) one. Over the span of about 90 seconds they move about 25-30 degrees to the northeast, before they seem to fade out behind the clouds. During this time the leading light increased its distance from the trailing one to about 5 moon diameters. The trailing light grew less fuzzy over the period of time that I followed it. The velocity of the objects was consistent with either high-altitude airplanes or satellites. The speed, color, and brighness was not consistent with any meteor I've ever seen.

 when I first saw it I thought it was one of the fighters from Seymour Johnson air force base. it looked like one of the landing lights on the planes. we were about 5 miles from the base and there were planes flying all around. we noticed that there were no other lights on what ever it is. there were no red or green and no strobe just a white light that looked like a bright star. then we saw what looked like smoke coming from it. it looked kinda like a comet with a tail. then it flashed and split off onto to lights. kept the same altitude and speed.

 the two lights stayed on the same course but kept drifting farther apart but still going in the same direction. the light in the front flashed again and we saw a small puff of smoke but it did not split into two. they just kept going and flew right over the base.

 I have lived here all my life and I have seen every kinda of plane go in and out of the base . I have never seen anything like this, it also made no sound,  we could not make out any kind of craft.  but we could tell the lights were attached to something. I  had heard  the stories of ufo landings on the base.  a lot of people around here have seen ufos and flying saucers. and black triangles. but I never give it much thought.

I had just arrived at my home in Plant City, Florida after visiting a friend of mine in Tampa earlier that evening.

 I had travelled with the t-tops of my Pontiac TransAm off and was admiring the night sky as I parked the vehicle in my back yard.As I looked toward the constellation Gemini, I did a double take. Two stars appeared to be moving. They were moving slowly from west to east. One was following directly behind the other and and was to the mind's eye a distance of between two fingers making a ""victory"" sign.

 In order to rationalize what I was seeing, I wondered if these were two satellites in a linear orbit. I have seen single satellites in orbit both at night and near dusk, but I have never seen one follow the other.

 As I continued to watch, the second light moved southward and caught up with the front light. The two lights then continued to proceed eastward directly in formation (seperated by now the distance between the index and little finger) just above Ursa Major and literally faded from view. A northbound commercial airliner at approximately 25,000-35,000 feet agl on a nortwesterly heading was visible in the lower eastern sky. By comparison, these two objects appeared to be much, much higher than the commercial aircraft.

 What was the most fascinating thing about this sighting was the almost scary ability of the two craft to blend in with the stars. Unless you spotted them and followed their movement, you wouldn't even think that anything out of the ordinary was occuring in the night sky.

 I can still not rationalize what these two objects were, nor how to explain their movements. Did any satelite or space station activity occur over central Florida at that time?  Thanks

At approximately 9 p.m on 4/29/05 4 friends and I were together, when I spotted a brilliant orange light in the western sky. My first reaction was that it was on fire. It did not appear to be a plane since we could see planes in the vicinity and the features on this seemed very different to airplane lights. This supposedly flaming light kept moving towards us for about a minute when suddenly it split into two. Both of the lights were as large and brilliant as the first one had been but now we could see smoke trails coming from them. This lasted for about 10 or 20 seconds when suddenly a third light appeared, this one was very dim and we only saw it because it seemed to be illuminated by the two other lights. At this point we began thinking it was only one object since with the appearance of the 3rd light, it formed a triangular pattern. This triangle suddenly stopped moving towards us and seemed to take a 45-degree path upwards. The Triangle was clearly visible for about 30 seconds when the two bright lights at the bottom disappeared. The smoke that had been emitted from these two bottom lights also stopped. The smaller dimmer one didn?t seem affected by this and kept rising for maybe a minute or 2 minutes longer. It was passing next to a star when suddenly it exploded. This explosion was not as an airplane?s is supposed to be, there was no fire visible but debris seemed to go in every direction and maybe a second after the original explosion a shockwave appeared. The shockwave was bright blue and it moved very quickly, shortly after this we were able to see debris from the explosion falling, very slowly. We were left speechless and wondering what it was. We checked the news outlets but there seemed to be nothing on this. Surely someone else had to see it.

While driving to a bluegrass concert, my husband and I saw the weirdest thing we've ever seen in our lives. We hope others saw what we did so people wont think we are crazzy or on drugs. 

Well...I said""look!"" pointing to sky. We pulled over and what we saw may be a once in a life time thing. This is not a lie!!!! We saw this huge orange light with a tail like a comet coming to hit the earth...then the tail faded away and the orange light grew smaller almost as small as a star in the sky with a even bigger white glow around it. 

As this object moves across the sky it all of a sudden divedes into two little star objects. One of the objects continues to move while the other all of a sudden lets of these rings that grow larger around the small object and it seemed as if that object exploded but with no sound. It also seemed like it set of millions of tiny other objects.....or like some type of wave. 

we then jump in the car thinking that the world is about to end...this freaked us out..but also excited me...The object that was left then continued to float across the sky....during all this there where several airplains in the sky and I wounder if anyone eles saw this. It was a beautiful thing tho see.

My friends and I were out on a golfcourse about to play manhunt (a game which involves two teams and hiding in the dark). We were scoping out some area to hide in until I looked up and saw what looked like a moving star with symmetrical blue smoke on both sides. The smoke was on moving behind the ""star"" in a curved shape. I was like, ""That can't be an airplane!"" Everyone thought it was the craziest thing they had ever seen! Then all of the sudden, the ""star"" blew up into two pieces and it looked like a nuclear explosion in the sky. I was thinking ""Oh my god, a meteor is going to hit the earth."" But the thing was, it didn't seem as if it was going to hit us at all. The ""star"" blew up into two smaller stars and kept on going in a straight line, one star behind the other. They did'nt dissapear at all and kept on going in one straight path. It was the freakiest thing that I have ever seen in my life. I don't know what the hell it was, but it's nothing that could have been made by man. It also couldn't be a meteor because when a meteor hits, it disintegrates. This one just kept on going. I'm wondering if anyone else saw this. It seemed like my friends and I were the only people that saw it. Please post something if you have seen something similar.

**** Just Found This Website*****    Thats Why I Am Posting my Story ******** 

In 1965 , I was a over the road truck driver, for a major trucking company.  I and another company driver, that was driving another unit, were headed north on route 100 .  We were about (8) miles from the small city of Pulaski, Va. This was about 3:00 AM...

 This route 100 was a (2) lane highway,with surrounding montains. There were many ""hard pulls"" on these mountains, for diesel trucks of this time period. (170 horse power).

 This particular morning (3:00 AM) that I and the other company driver witnessed this sighting, the temperature was in the (70s), and the sky was clear as a bell . You could see the many stars in the heavens.

 When I witnessed this sighting, I was pulling a mountain, at approx.(20 mph).  The first thing I noticed was the mountains on my left, was ""lit up"" like someone had turned on a giant spotlight!  I then saw  what I assumed was meteors coming down from the sky. These were displaying a white hot light,and had like contrails behind them. As they came down to where I could see them better, I changed my mind from meteors, to maybe a large aircraft had broken up in the sky,and was crashing .

 On the mountain that I was pulling up.  I could see the top of the mountain,and I could see the valley below. When the objects that I seen, I assumed they was going to crash into the earth. And I would have been a witness to a major airplane crash!  But to my amazement, the objects just pulled up ,and went thru this valley like a speeding bullet.  They traveled the entire length of the valley, and then ""shot"" straight up in the sky!  Also, when these objects was at my direct left, they gave off a large amount of white light, and leaving white smoke with sparks contrails.  I could see just like it was high noon daylight!  I could even see the green leaves on the trees .

 When it was all over. The other company driver that was ahead of me had pulled over at the top of the mountain, at a wide spot.  When I came to stop behind his unit, he came ""running""to my truck, and with astonished look on his face said, What in the H**L was that ?   I then asked him what he had seen.   He told me the exactly what I had seen !  What was it?  Till this day (2005) I do not know !   But its one thing for certain. I and the other company driver had just witnessed something very strange .

((COMMENT FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC SITE))

Dear Mr. Davenport,

Thank you so very much for all that you do to help our global community.  I have been a regular to your site for some time now and this is my first time posting a report.  However,  what I saw and confirmed on April 12th, 2005 forced me to share this with the center in the hopes it will added to the database as a footnote.  

Currently the database has 2 reports of a flying triangle over the Los Angeles and Santa Monica area on April 12th at approx. 13:00  (1 o'clock p.m.)  What our 2 witnesses were observing was the B-2 Stealth Bomber performing a low altitude fly-by of Dodger Stadium for the opening day ceremonies.  I observed the B-2 at approx. 13:07 from my backyard as it headed west towards Santa Monica at very low altitude approx. 700 to 900 ft. , roughly the same altitude as LAPD helicopters, and bank towards the north Santa Monica Mountains.  I tried to get a shot of this amazing airplane with my cell phone camera but I was too slow. What caught my attention was the engine noise.  Nothing like I've ever heard before.   My next door neighbor also witnessed the fly-by.  I live in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, roughly half way between the witness in downtown and the witness to my west  in Santa Monica.

 
Quote from the Los Angeles Times 4/13/05
""The largest crowd ever at Dodger Stadium - 55,892 - barely had time to settle after watching the obligatory B-2 stealth bomber roar past when low-flying projectiles began doing damage. Starter Jeff Weaver gave up 11 hits and eight runs before being pulled after a Pedro Feliz homer.""

An airshow  message board also noted the B-2 fly-by for the Dodgers opener, and noted there will be another on Memorial Day May 30th, 2005.  Let's see how many reports come in that day.

Sincerely,

I saw a small airplane descending to the field in Sandpoint, Idaho.  Beneath the body of the plane, there was a much whiter missle-shaped object, about five-sixths of the lenght of the plane. It seemed to be suspended just below the belly of the plane.  

There is a mountain of 2000' that is the background for the view, dark rock and evergreens. The weather was clear, and the sighting was to the north of my house, an unobstructed view, and about one mile away.  The plane was very quiet-usually the jets are much noisier!  

Very short sighting, but it caught my attention, because the plane looked grey in contrast to the really slender cigar/missle shaped craft(?), which was white, no lights or markings that I could see.

My DVD player hiccuped about 30 seconds before I saw the plane-picture went black, and could not be called up with the remote. Has not happened before.

My initial thoughts were that it was an airplane that would veer out momentarily.  When it didn't happen, I thought the craft was going to crash and I was growing very concerned when suddenly, the speeding plane just stopped and was vertically suspended in the sky. 

It was then I noticed that the ""plane"" was shaped like a long missile, I checked ""cigar"" shape.  It could be clearly seen though it did appear to have some haziness around it. 

I was mesmerized and watched the craft just hang there, vertically, for quite some time.  After 10 minutes, I wanted to get a better view, so I went into the garage and got my binoculars and stepped out on the back deck.  

The craft was still there and though I was able to see it better, I saw no unusual markings.  

After quite a while, the ""craft"" suddenly shifted from vertical and took off leaving a jetstream behind, vanishing into the east sky.

My boyfriend and I were in the parking lot of Logan's Roadhouse Restuarant in the Veterans plaza around 9pm at night.  A light in the sky caught our attention, so we decided to stand there and observe it.  

It was a red light with a tail located in the sky above the field directly across the street from the restaurant.  At first, we thought it was a flare, but quickly dismissed that it wasn't because it wasn't moving upwards.  Rather, it was moving very slowly towards our direction.  The tail faded out as the light slowed down to a stop and eventually became a solitary red light.  We watched it for several minutes and during this time, it stayed stationary.  We ran through all of the possibilities of what it could be and we were just stunned having seen nothing like this before.  I even remember looking around the packed parking lot and seeing if anyone else was observing the same thing.  

We decided to move on because nothing was happening.  After walking a short distance, I thought to myself to just take one more look.  I'm glad I did because what I observed next was shocking.

The red light had grown into a full-fledged self-contained exploding orb in the sky.  I know that sounds weird, but it's almost as if the light were in a clear balloon and exploding within the balloon.  There was no sound as this happened either and we thought that was weird.  Next, the bright orb dimmed and became white, then split into three separate white orbs.  Two headed southward and one headed northward.    The two headed southward traveled a short distance until one literally faded out and the other looked perfectly like a star amongst the others in the night sky and just stayed there.  The one headed northward also faded ever so slightly at a slow pace in the sky and also eventually looked like another star in the night sky.

That is what we observed from the time the red light caught our attention until the three orbs faded and blended in with the night sky.

On 5 June 2005, at approx. 2135 hrs. my vehicle along with another vehicle were travelling north on Alt 95 Hwy a few miles north of Yerington, Nevada. There were 4 adults in the two vehicles. We were travelling together and were in communication by portable radios. My business partner called me on the radio, and asked; ""DID YOU SEE THAT?"" I answered him and said ""YES! and explained to him I thought it was just a reflection in the window from passing cars. The object was seen at the above time and date.

 As we were travelling north, and I always carry a GPS handheld, I instantly looked at the time, and turned on the GPS for the exact location. The object came from out of NNE at about 30 degrees off north. I estimated the object at 35 degrees off the horizen, it was travelling at an angle of 25 to 30 degrees heading towards the mountains in front of our direction of travel in which the object disappeared behind after 2-3 seconds of the sighting. The object came in from the east heading in a west direction.

 The object was ""cylinder"" shaped, even a ""bullet"" shape as my business partner descibed it. The object made no sound, no other a/c were noted in the area, no other lights were seen after or prior to the sighting. The object did not emit any other objects or lights. What all that saw the object was a ""RED"" aura on the bottem, and a ""BLUE/GREEN"" light half way up the object, this aura light was bright in intensity. Holding out my hand at arms length, the size of the object was 1/4 inch thick and 1/2 inch long. Taking a best educated guess, this was a very large object! Because of the darkness of the mountains and trees in the area, I could not reference a distance and or a true altitude. As we were at about 3-4000 feet in altitude, my best guess the altitude was at least 10,000 to 15,000 feet  (See drawing enclosed, lines are only drawn to show direction and movement)  As my spouse was driving,(she did not see the object) I was in the passenger seat of our VW Jetta. I noticed the object coming out of the right corner of the window coming in from the east towards the mountains in front of us...  The mountains were about 30-40 miles north of our position, as Hwy. 50 crosses Hwy Alt 95 which goes into Silver Springs, Nevada.

 My business partner and I compared notes at to what we both saw. The other witness was a 20 year old woman, who was driving my business partners car also at the time of the sighting. (Their statements will be posted or mailed at a later date.) My business partner is 22 years old, works at a casino and owns his own internet business, the woman is 20 and works at a resturant. My background is 12 years in the USAF, several years in financial services and many years self employed. From my military experince, this was no known military or commercial aircraft that I know of. I have witnessed meteors, fireballs, and resently while in Colorado Springs, Colorado the falling of space junk which lit up the sky in a shower of sparkler lights... In all my years I have never seen anything that would remotely compare to what this object was. I would say it was a solid object, with a ""RED"" aura on the bottem and a ""BLUE/GREEN"" upper half and shaped like a cylinder/bullet in design. The estimated speed that the object was moving? Taking a college guess I would estimate the object travelled over 20-30 miles in 2-3 seconds. Estimated location of object; Lat; 39.06826 N    Long; 119.14044W  NOTE: The following day, while in Reno, Nevada, my business partner did experience a severe nosebleed for about 5 min. Again, he is 22 years old, and expressed to me, that he had never had a nosebleed before. His mother even lived in Reno, and he was sorta used to the altitude. I did tell him it could be the altitude and the dryness that may of caused the nosebleed episode.

 At the time of our sighting of this ""unknown"" I would estimate there were a half dozen other vehicles going north in front and behind us because the main Hwy 95 was flooded out due to a dam breaking and flooding the highway at Fallon, Nevada. So several vehicles had to be detoured. Hopefully, others will call or send in their reports from that area.

 As mentioned, the two other witnesses will submit their reports to me shortly, and I will forward these to NUFORC.

On 7/20/05 I was at the lake (Lake o' the Pines, Texas) photographing the unusual numbers of jets that were flying over our area that evening.  I was taking a few of a passenger jet flying from west to east and I heard what I thought was another flying off to my east.  As soon as the passenger jet disappeared from my view into the treeline I turned around and spotted the source of the sound to my east, and I don't believe it was a jet because it had no wings, though it sounded like one.  I am certain it's the same object I photographed on 6/23/05  ( http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44577.html ) as it is the same color, has what looks to be an indention or band in the center, and the rear seems to have a bit of a hump.  The object was flying roughly from south to north again and was to my east northeast by the time I took these photographs of it.  It was low again (maybe 10,000 feet) and moving fairly slowly (I would guess 200-250 MPH) and seemed to fly in a straight path.  I didn't notice any lights or any other strange behavior.  The time was 7:54PM according to the two pictures I took of it.  My camera is a Fujufilm 2800 (2 megapixel) and I was zoomed to 6X optically.

 I have since done some searching and found a fairly complete list of drones, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), rockets, and missiles used by the US military in the past and present complete with pictures, and have found no pictures that matched this object ( http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/ ).

 The two pictures I took of it will follow via email.

The lighted object appeared to travel in a square and a triangular and a figure eight type pattern appearing to maintain its general position.  After several nights of watching this object appear I retrieved a Bushnell 20 power spotting scope that I used during my years of marksmanship competition in NRA sponsored .22 caliber shoots, i.e. the scope would allow a shooter to see at 100 yards with incredible detail the 'hits' of a .22 bullet on a target.  I figured the spotting scope would allow me to 'check out a satellite'; however, to my amazement and my then wife's amazement what I saw through the spotting scope did not appear to be a satellite.  I used a telephone pole to 'brace' or steady the spotting scope.  The 'illuminated object' indeed did move in a figure eight pattern; a triangular pattern and a square/circular pattern AND under magnification of the spotting scope red lights flew into the illuminated object and green lights flew away from the object...it was like watching a bee's nest with incoming and outgoing activity.

A friend and I were ""power walking"" around the park opposite Med North in Fort Lee, NJ.  As soon as we made the turn heading East - facing the G. W. Bridge - I saw a bullet shaped (I only saw one end of it) object right next to the South side of the bridge.  Which meant that it would have been hovering over the Hudson River.  It would have been invisible to us except that there was some low lighting or shimmering effect outling the object from our vantage point.  It seemed huge.  I was still trying to figure out what it was that I was looking at, and hadn't yet mentioned it to my friend when she shreiked ""what is it?"". (We were still walking the whole time.) She was an hysterical person by nature and was getting a little frantic (still walking). It looked so much like the Goodyear Blimp that I assumed that is what it had to be.  It had to be right? If that is what the Blimp looked like with no lights except for the outline.  I assured my friend it was just the blimp and we made the turn and walked to the car and left the area.  I figured that if it was anything else, there were enough people with terraces in the many high rise apartment buildings overlooking the bridge and the river - someone else would have seen it.  There was no report of anything strange that I heard or read about so I assumed it was the blimp after all on a joy ride.  I did think it was pretty dangerous and I'm not sure if the blimp could hover in one place and not move. I put it out of my mind and some time later had the occassion to actually see the Goodyear blimp near the G. W. Bridge.  The size was all wrong.  It was tiny compared to what we saw that night.  I only wish we would have continued to walk towards the bridge and not left the area.  I do feel a little silly reporting this.  I guess I have always been waiting to hear about someone else reporting this incident. I'm not sure of the date and time.

It was two hypersonic plasma spacecraft being tested near the TRW Hypersonic Test Range in stoddard valley.  They were not visible until they illuminated the sky.  They might have been using high power microwave and lasers to generate magnetic fields and magnetohydrodynamic or electrohydrodynamic propulsion.  They would have been invisible to radar as plasma disrupts radio signals.  They were definitely hypersonic aircraft or spacecraft as I am aware of some from an aerospace company I used to work for.  It had rocket flames which would be magnetohydrodynamic diffuser generators to provide power.  I know the Air Force Research Laboratory is building UAV's and SDI weapons using these same technologies.  Also they might have had flickering skins to confuse IR heak seeking missiles from tracking it as it had a enormously long rocket plume(They had intense lights from them that were flickering and plasma doesn't flash at such a high frequency).  The two spacecraft darted across the sky at high velocity going in opposite directions on the hypersonic test range.  The plasma was blue and there was no noise or shockwave as the plasma attenuates the shock wave at hypersonic speed.  You can find more information from Venik's Aerospace Website.  They also test hypersonic missiles and missiles can't keep darting back and forth for 60 minutes at least.  It was near the border of Nevada.  I haven't seen them test since that time.  But they acknowledged that a super secret TRW test range was there but couldn't comment on the subject as it was highly classified information.

i just got home and turned on the t.v and out of the corner of my eye their was a light in the sky traveling, it was low in the dark sky , the size of the moon , greenish colour round shaped, and fizzing , it seemed about a mile or two from me , it must of crossed Birmingham airport but when i seen it , it was in chelmsley wood area , i had a clear view of it as i lived in a tower block at the time, it was heading towards castle vale , and sutton coldfield .i thought it was a flare at first , green , fizzing but then thought flares dont travel across the sky  horrizontal at a constant speed for such a distance and speed was to fast  i estimate it was travling at a aircraft speed 400 or 500 an hour, i wouldent say it was an metior it looked low in the sky as if it could crash in birmingham and proberley did , i thought it could of been a milatary weapon ( flames of the tail end of a  war plane or missile , though i heard no noise ) my best guess is that it was a cruise missile was  being tested as the gulf war was not long after , or may be it was something else it was something ive never seen before and never forget.

It was a shiny dot in the sky. at first, i just thought it was a baloon. But it did something a balloon could never do. It sat in one spot for a minute or so then zoomed across the sky like a bullet.  After another minute or so, it zoomed back to the same spot. 

After another few minutes it zoomed off into the horizon.

First thing I thought was...wow where is the wings? I dismissed it until another tube went by....exact flight path as the other. Same description. It didn't hit me until after I seen them that I started wondering. Where were the wings? Where was the sound? Was it a missile? Seemed odd it was flying in such busy skys...but then again...it made perfect sense because the skys were so busy anyway with planes and such. Besides that who would report it? Its taken me 3 months just to report it because I had to come to termsn with what I seen. A metallic tube or cylinder object flying about 1000 ft maybe a bit more up in the air. How long or big?

My childhood friend and I were playing a game of catch with a baseball in our neighborhood.  The ball went over our heads and up the street.  We both ran after it to see who could get it first.  We got to the ball at the same time.  Neither one of us touched the ball, we were both distracted by what we saw ahead of us in the sky.  

We were looking south and there was a Catholic church across the road from our neighborhood.  What we saw looked like it was perched on top of the tall pointed steeple.  I quickly realized that what I was seeing was actually miles away from us, and it had to be very large.  It was a very unique geometric shape, unlike anything else I have ever seen.  It was taller than it was wide.  It was very symmetric in shape.  It looked like a tall triangle was sitting on a mirror and the top point had been cut off about 3/4 of the way up, so it had a flat top and bottom.  It also looked like two more shorter stubbed triangles had been placed on either side of the object directly in the middle tapering out.  It appeared that the object was black and it had what looked like red flourescent light bulbs on it that followed the same pattern as the outer edges of the shape.  The lights were blinking on and off in a random but slow pattern.  The sky in the background was pure blue without a cloud in the sky, so the object was very distinct in the sky.  It seemed to hover in place for about thirty seconds and then started to slowly rise and move away.  Then it suddenly bolted faster than my eyes could keep up, I just remember knowing that it had traveled faster than anything on this planet could ever go, except maybe a bullet.

My friend and I just stood there with our mouths hanging open in awe at what we had just seen.  We looked at each other for a few seconds without saying anything and then I said ""Did you just see that?"".  He said yes.  I told him not to say anything to me about what he saw, just to go home and write it all down and draw the object.  I then told him that we would compare our notes the next morning when we were on the bus for school.  Just for the record, I only new to do all of this because the TV show 'Project Blue Book' was a series on TV at the time and I had seen the Air Force investigators on the show tell people to do that, so they could buid a more credible case.  Anyway, we both went home and wrote and drew what we had seen.  I told my parents about it, but of course they were not going to believe a little boy telling such wild tales.  The next day my friend and I compared our notes and drawings and they were identical.  I have never forgotten that event nor have I ever seen any other drawings or pictures that looked like the object we saw.  I have always wondered if anyone else saw that object that night.  I also want it to be known that I am not sure of the exact date that this took place, but I believe that I am fairly close to it.  If anyone out there saw this, all those years ago, please post your sighting so I will know that my friend and I were not the only two that saw this amazing sight.

Explosion in the dark cloudless sky early this morning.

It was at high elevation and appeared to be over Terry, MS (although that may be a bad guess).

It took place @ 6:00am + - 5min.

There was an initial bright greenish flash.

It lit my up driveway and my first thought was lightening, but upon looking up, I was met by this odd spectacle.

what I witnessed was a ball of fire that slowly traveled a short distance across the sky leaving a large smoke trail before it exploded.

No audible evidence of the explosion ever presented itself.

 A friend of mine saw the same event while out jogging in Vicksburg, MS.

He said it looked like it was heading almost straight down from his perspective 50mi away from Florence.

As for viewing angle, he said it appeared to be approximately E @ a 45deg up from the horizon.

From my perspective in Florence, it was headed SE on a slow trajectory and lasted approximately 10sec.

My viewing angle put it approximately WSW @ 80deg up from the horizon.

 In addition, what looked like a shooting star traveling SW at high speed intersected where the burning object would have been if it hadn't exploded a fraction of a second earlier.

 Really looked like an airplane was being shot down by missiles.

Can't imagine what else it might have been.

It certainly didn't appear to be a meteor judging by past experience.

Rather unnerving....

Point of light leaves an expanding glowing pear-shaped cloud of gasses, visible in N.County San Diego.

When first seen, there was a pear shaped glowing fan of gasses behind a single bright fireball.  The fireball was moving approximately North to South.  Behind the globe of expanding gasses, there was a contrail? twisting off to the west/north-west.  The westernmost end of the twisty trail was red with the fading sunlight.  The trail became a very bright white as it got more twisty and blended into the expanding pear of gasses.

 After about two mintes, the point of light disappeared, no new gasses were added to the pear, though it continued to expand in size and fade in intensity.  The twisty trail stayed bright for several more minutes, the colors shifting as the sun set.  After twienty mintes, nothing remain visible of the twisty trail.

 Attempting to follow the point of light to the south, about three minutes after it disappeared, it appeared again, continueing in a straight line.  The new pear of gasses forming behind it glowed reddish (like the sunset).

 My guess would be a meteor skipping across the top of the atmosphere.  The initial outgassing causing it to spin, spewing its gasses into the twisty trail.  Finally just melting away on each skip into the atmosphere.

 On the other hand, it may have been something totally else.  If you know, I'd like to hear back what it really is.

 It occurs to me that the oldest part of the trail was the red of sunset, suggesting that it may have been low in the atmosphere.  From mid trail on, including hte initial pear of gasses, it was bright white, suggesting it was in full sunlight, not scattered throught he atmosphere.  I don't know what kind of object would do this starting at a low altitude.

 Thanks.

At 20:43 hrs. we saw a bright light that literally began to form a large perfect bubble of light expanding from some point to the west of the Silver City Mountains.

As the luminous cloud began to expand (white in color with orange) we saw an object heading straight south at a perfect horizontal line with this cloud emission coming out of the end.  The light which had a strobe or red light on it quickly disappeared to the south.  The cloud grew into a perfect sphere like the blisters around the crafts in WAR OF THE WORLDS. Then the cloud disipated. We immediately called 911 and within minutes they reported that the FAA said it was a missile fired from Vandenberg.

However, I have seen missiles launched and this did not fit the pattern.  We could see the object and the cloud, no contrail, just this wierd cloud that looked nuclear.

I was afraid that it might have been just that. But it wasn't.  I do always trust what the government reports.  I have seen missile launches from White Sands and this looked different.

I arrived home from shopping and parked my vehicle in the garage.  Neighbors were walking westward down our cul-de-sac street when they passed in front our driveway and asked ""do you see the light in the sky?'  I stepped out of the garage and walked down the driveway approximately 20 feet to the street in order to see a trail of glowing orange-white light low in the western sky.  This trail of light had a ""switchback"" appearance to it and originated in the west and traveled across the low horizon towards my location in the east.  This trail glowed quite brightly with varying intensities across the length of the trail for approximately 10-15 minutes and then slowly disipated and disappeared.

 Above the trail of orange-white light low in the sky appeared a very bright blue-white light traveling northeast to southwest high in the sky at a constant altitude.  This bright blue-white light illuminated an obvious and very large ""cone"" of smoke or spent gas behind it as it progressed across the sky.  This light burned much shorter than the low trail of light glowed - perhaps 5-7 minutes.  When the bright blue-white light extinguished it did so with a momentary super-intense bright white flash.  After the high, bright blue-white light extinguished the extremely large ""cone"" of smoke or gas eminating from behind the light was still visible for approximately 10 minutes until it too disipated and disappeared.

 Throughout the event I was looking at the western sky with binoculars and sighted 5 aircraft that appeard to be helicopters operating along the low horizon.

 Local radio news reports broadcast on KFYI AM 550 in Phoenix, AZ reported the event as a ""top-secret satellite launch from Vandenburg A.F.B. in California"".  I have witnessed several night launches of missles, rockets and space launch vehicles (some from Vandenburg A.F.B.) and none of these previous launches left a ""switchback"" trail of orange-white spent gasses in the atmosphere.  Further, if this was a vertical, space-vehicle launch, what explains the bright, blue-white light traveling northeast to southwest across the sky at a constant altitude and then extinguishing with a flash?  I could understand the news report as a ""satellite launch"" if the launch vehicle went out of control (creating the ""switchback"" trail of orange-white light) and the launch was pre-empted by ground control and the vehicle destroyed.  That would also explain the ""horziontal"", northeast to southwest travel of the bright, blue-white light at a constant altitude, the ""cone"" of smoke or gas behind it and the momentary super-intense bright white flash just before the light extinguished.

""It was after 11:00 PM, and from inside the cabin, when all the lights were out and some kids were asleep, I saw something through the window and got up.  I went outside alone for a minute, then went inside to get a counselor.  A counselor and another camper came out and watched it with me for about 10 minutes. A triangle hovered above trees, went back and forth, went down a little bit, then went back up, and three corner lights were flashing red, blue, white.  There were little blue lights around the outline of the triangle, like Christmas lights, but the kind in a tube.  It didn't make any noise.  It turned on its beam from underneath. It didn't shine all the way to the ground at first. It would shut off and turn on quickly and shine closer to the ground, the beam was slowly dropping down. When the light was off it just looked like a black hole in the middle. The beam stayed on a long time, almost the whole 10 minutes. It was over the woods, maybe over the river. There was something the beam was shining on, like a star, it didn't move, it didn't go up in the beam, it just shined on it.  Then the beam shut off and the triangle shot right up into the air faster than a bullet and was gone."" I checked with the counselor before we left for home, he confirmed the sighting.

Very hard to focus on it because of ""shimmering surface"" and low light conditions.

I returned multiple times to same area, time, light conditions, never to see anything like it again.  It reminded me of a surfacing submarine at first thought,but water much too shallow.

The trail went in what looked like loops with a few  sparp zig-zags or ""V"" shape. the lights and gases stay visable for atleast 15 minutes that I saw but there is no telling how long it was there before I saw it.

I was sitting in my living room watching TV when I heard a fairly loud, deep rumbling noise coming from outside that lasted approximately one minute, that sounded different than any normal aircraft that I know of. 

I then went outside to investigate and looked up at the night sky and noticed an odd, wide, fairly short contrail situated right next to the moon.  It looked to me like it possibly could have come from a Vandenberg missile launch (I've seen several of them in my lifetime out here on the West Coast). I called Vandenberg today and was told there was no missile launch from them last night. 

I ran across news reports online today of the launch of a two manned spacecraft in northwestern China yesterday morning, and the time of that launch seems to correspond with the time that I experienced the rumbling and observed the contrail.

The outline was in amber (orange) lights, and thought this to be unusual, also the size was amazing. Judging by the distance it was from me I would have to guess it was as large as a football field in length. 

I took my eyes off it for a second because I was driving, when I looked again it had changed shape to a triangle and three bright lights took the place of the amber lights.  There was no sound.

I started to pull over to have a good look at what this was, when there was a bright flash that lit up the tree tops.  When I look at where the object was it had disappeared.


No there was no sound.  At first I thought I was looking at a giant air plane because the amber lights were outlined in the shape of a commercial jet, but huge.

Star Trek Actor Sees UFO In Alabama.

In the biography of DeForrest Kelley, who played Dr. Leonard McCoy on the original Star Trek series called ""From Sawdust To Stardust"" by Terry Lee Rioux from Pocket Books on page #87, is a report of a UFO.  

Here is the report as quoted from the book:  

""Many years later, Kelly confessed that they saw an unidentified flying object while driving across country.  He said he was riding in the back of the car;  they were entering Alabama when they saw it. 

'This object came by at a tremendous rate of speed at a very low altitude...around 700 or 800 feet...it looked to be about 65 feet in length.  It was a long, cigar-shaped object with green and blue flames coming out of its side.'  There was a soft sound like a missile, it had a red taillight flashing, and it had no wings.  

Once in Montgomery, the trio (DeForrest Kelley, his wife Carolyn, and Superman actor George Reeves) found a newspaper that carried stories of the sightings.  Even when Kelley told the story decades later, he did not mention Reeves by name.  He quietly guarded the old friendship, and, besides, some things were just too fantastic to believe.""  

For further information on this story, refer to the Carolyn Kelley interviews:  ""My Real-Life Encounter With A UFO,"" National Enquirer, January 13, 1987.   

Carolyn Kelley and friends corroborate the story, and the Enquirer was accurate.","Substitute Teacher",2,1,"cigar",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Date unknown.  We will attempt to determine it.

The sky was very clear and black.  Stars were bright as well.  

We noticed 3 falling stars.  One before the event and 2 after the event.  

Coming from the southeast heading to the northwest.  Heard no noise, but a train was passing about 7 miles away.  A large lake is the the south/southeast of us so sound travels very well.  

The object reminded me of a falling star, but orange/yellow in color and about 20 times larger.  Also it was going in the opposite direction of a falling star.  It had somewhat of a trail or tail following behind. 

This whole episode only lasted in our eyesight only a few seconds do to trees, barns, awnings.  

Waited and watched for about 1 1/2 hours to see if another one came by, but nothing but the 2 falling stars that were more of a white color.  I would describe it as missile like.

Five bright amber lights form a ""W"" formation and hover 5 mins over NW FL sky 1840L Mon 7 Nov '05.

My sons came running into the house talking about lights in the sky, so I went out and ran over to an E-W street w/them for a unobstructed view.  

What we all (a couple neighbors also came out and witnessed them) were five bright lights (amber-colored) which were holding steady in the shape of a giant ""W"" up in the night sky.  

The formation was approx 25 degrees abv horizon, sky was clear and dark (1.5 hrs after sunset.) 

The lights held position, evenly-spaced, for approx 5 mins, during which time I ran back inside my house to get the video camera, but battery was dead!   

At one point, watched a small, civilian plane approach the formation, then turn away and circle a couple times before departing.  From our perspective, believe the plane was closer to us than the bright lights. 

When ""W"" formation broke apart, they did so one by one, starting w/furthest N or right side, turn away, then vanish after a couple seconds, then next one, and so on.  Next day, I spoke w/military contacts who researched and told me no milair was up over the Eglin reservation in NW Florida at time of sighting.  

Am a retired USAF Special Ops aviator w/nearly 5,000 hrs of flight time in a wide range of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, and I can't explain what we watched that night.  

Also, learned several active duty AF people witnessed the lights that night and couldn't explain them, either.  As a former journalist and military aviator, I consider myself pretty level-headed and thorough.

There were no milair in the area (Eglin Military Reservation) at the time of sighting (I checked w/base) but one small civilian plane did fly into the area during time of sighting.  It flew N to S, crossing in front of formation, then circled a 180 back N until it was clear of our view, then did a 360 before departing back to N.  We all felt the small plane was closer to us than the bright lights, since we could see it's red and green wing beacons and white anti-collision strobe.  The bright lights were evenly spaced and held perfectly still in the ""W"" formation for the five minutes I saw them.

Multiple AD USAF witnesses report formation of bright lights hovering over rural Santa Rosa County FL

Addendum 2 to earlier report - This is a compilation of three additional witness accounts who are active duty Air Force flyers who did not want to be identified.

Witness 1 was driving W-bound on Hwy 98 near Navarre when he observed a formation of 5 bright white lights in the dark WNW sky.  He continued to watch the formation of lights in an attempt to identify what type of aircraft they were.  As he continued driving W, he realized the formation (described as sort of a diamond shape) wasn't moving, but just hung in the sky at approx 35-40 degrees elevation.  Since he was driving, he couldn't remain visually fixed on the formation, and after approx 10 mins of glancing while driving, he glanced back and realized the lights were no longer there.  He did not see them depart, but claims he had only looked away from the formation to the road a matter of a few seconds.

Witness 2 was also driving W-bound on Hwy 98 near Navarre and observed a similar formation of lights.  He at first assumed they were AFSOC helos on a night training mission, but after several minutes of driving realized his helos were still there, in the same angular, diamond-like formation, and the lights continued to hold position, hovering at what appeared to be very high altitude.  He said as he continued his drive W he doubted his helicopter formation theory more and more, especially when the formation broke apart.  He described the formation break as a one-by-one realignment into almost a straight line, with some decending and some ascending, then the light on the far end of the formation suddenly veered away from the others and vanished.  This pattern of breakaway continued for the next minute, until all the lights were gone.  He has no explanation as to the source of the lights, but is very familiar with flares and other air-ordnance which could cause illumination, and stated ""These lights were under controlled guidance."" Witness 3 was driving N on Hwy 87 after turning from it's intersection w/Hwy 98.  He witnessed ""several bright lights"" through the trees off to the western sky.  He at first thought they were stars or planets, but as he got more glimpses through the trees, he said he realized they were ""way too bright"" to be either stars or planets.  He then also assumed they were a formation of helos doing night ops, and didn't pay much more attention until he turned W-bound off Hwy 87 onto East Bay Rd just south of Holley.  That was when he saw the lights better and re-evaluated them as ""unknown.""  He only saw them for a minute or less after turning onto East Bay Rd before each light ""took off like a bat outta hell"" and the lights winked off, one by one.  He said he believes there were four or five lights in all.

None of the above three Air Force flyers reported seeing other aircraft in the sky during their incidents, and all three reported the times at somewhere between 18:30 and 18:50, lasting from 5-10 mins in duration.

I am a 47-year-old man with two master degrees in business and technology and I am still puzzled about the origin of this flying object.  

This sighting took place on the month of September in 1997.  At about 9am, as I was getting ready to start the day, I approach the window next to the bed and noticed a large cigar shaped object hovering over the area.   I was actually looking to the belly of the object.  At arm's distance, the object was about 6 inches and it had no features such as tail fins that could be seen. 

At the beginning I thought that it was some kind of cruise missile that was being tested, but that was impossible.  I noticed that the object did not produce a jet or propeller noise at all.  The object then proceeded to make a 180-degree turn and immediately went back to the direction where it first came from, at the same low speed, until it was no longer visible from my window.  This sighting lasted for about only 10 to 15 seconds.  

The whole incident took me by surprise, because I never thought that I would be able to witness thing like it  in that area and in broad day light.

Tonight I had walked into my back yard before retiring and looked at the rising moon, which was approximately 40 degrees above the horizon.  To the NNE, I could see what I thought was an aircraft headed south at approximately the same relative altitude as the rising moon from my ground perspective.  The bright white light which appeared to be the same intensity as a small aircraft's and about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length, also appeared to have red light in a halo effect around the white light but at a greatly reduced size and barely discernable from the white light.  I estimated the ""aircraft"" to be approximately ? mile away from me based on numerous other aircraft sightings over the years of airplanes flying overhead en route to our local airport.

 I watched the ""aircraft"" for approximately (1) minute and realized that it's lateral speed was slowing and it was now turning further west towards my location which could account for the illusion of it slowing down.  Although it still had the red halo effect, I realized that it was not an aircraft rotating beacon or navigation light.  I then called to my wife and twenty year old son to come outside and we watched for (1) minute more as the object began to slowly weave left to right and began to drop in altitude. The white light dimmed slightly and then it suddenly dropped what appeared to be (3) red fragments much like flares dropped by jet fighter aircraft.  The object zig-zagged left to right and still continued to drop in altitude headed south.  It emitted (3-4)red fragments and appeared to turn due east.  Its size continued to reduce which led me to believe it was moving away from me.  It was also appeared to reduce in size every time it emitted the fragments.  It finally disappeared altogether which left my family and I, awe struck.

 I have been a patrol sergeant with a local law enforcement agency for almost twenty years and have observed several missile launches from Vandenberg AFB which is approximately (200) miles SE of me.  The launches leave a visible smoke trail from my town and sometimes I can see the booster separations and engine burns, if the sky is clear.  I have also observed dozens of space junk re-entries, satellites including Iridium flares, and orbiting spacecraft, but I have never seen an object perform as this one did tonight.  It went from controlled navigation to weaving like a drunk driver and then straighten itself back out in seconds.  I have seen jet aircraft drop flare counter measures before and they have a systematic ejection, controlled decent and separation.  These fragments did not.

 I have a Navel Air Station approximately (30) miles west of me and FA-18 Hornets fly overhead day and night.  They are flying over to the China Lake and Nellis AFB test ranges, so I'm accustomed to the sounds they make, the navigation lights they have and the speeds they transit our airspace at.  This object had no sound and from the estimated distance and the fact that it was after 2300 hours, it was quiet.  There was no sound, no explosion, no smoke and unlike anything I had ever experienced before in real life.

From where i was standing it seemed to be smooth like a missile.It had a smoke trail behind it like an ordinary jet but slightly bigger. When i compared it to other planes flying at the same altitude, i decided that it had to be at leat 40 times bigger looking than the jets. It was moving southwest at a fairly high rate of speed. I lost sight of the object when it flew out of seeing range.

Following their checklist the team leader drove up the access road while the member followed on foot behind the vehicle for cover.  They observed a classic gray alien standing with a rod in one hand outside the fenceline.  

Following their training the member immediately challenged the being with his M-16 rifle and the being pointed the rod at him emitting some type of discharge knocking him out.  After this the being and object departed the area.  

Upon examination of the nuclear warhead by Air Force technicians it was discovered that the missile had been altered so it was not operational.  This account was published almost word for word in the National Inquirer but drew little attention.  

During this same time period there were numerous reports of UFO fly overs and landings near northern tier military installations but South Dakota drew little attention because it was not considered a northern tier base like Minot Air Force Base North Dakota.  

In the early 80s a reporter from the Inquirer returned to followup on this story with base personnel that may have had first hand knowledge of this incident.  Air Force personnel were told prior to the reporters arrival at the designated offices if they had heard or seen this UFO report they were to keep quiet.

I was taking my last work break at around 3:00 pm and I had gone up to the upper level of our parking structure, and as I stood there looking northward at the Orange County Skyline,  I saw some movement far in the Distance.  That is when I saw 3 Small, Metallic looking Circular Objects  flying in a triangular formation, Flying from East to West at a high rate of speed.  It almost looked like they were flying on a straight line from the Mountains East of the city of Orange, toward Long Beach and The Ocean. After I lost them in the Horizon to the east, I thought that was the last of it, but two minutes later, another object appeared in front of me, also moving fast on an East-West direction, as if trying to catch the other 3, except that this object seemed to bounce up and down as it flew westward.

At about the time the 3 objects flew by, but before the last one passed, a helicopter happened to fly by right over my head, at a fairly high altitude, that's when I realized that I could hear the copter's engine noise, but the 3 objects did not.

I can't be sure if they were man made or not, but even at the distance and altitude that they flew, they were visible enough to have seen wether they had wings or propellers, and I did not see either.

If they were made by the military, all I can think is that they might have been Jet powered Drones, or they must have been testing missiles near our area.

This is not the first time I've seen strange objects in the sky.

Last January I also saw an object hovering over Santa Ana, And I happen to know that someone else saw that object as well.  So now every time I go out on my breaks, I am more attentive of whats above me,  and it seems to be paying off.

I have lived in Florida for over 30 years. This is why I say the lights that myself and many,many others seen on 3-7-1998 was no missile launch.... With a missile launch comes a smoke trail. Anyone that has seen the shuttle or any other launch knows this.

I have thought of this night for several years. Tonight I did some resurch to see if anyone else reported these lights. It has made me believe I should tell what I saw.

I was at sebastian inlet on the south side jetty doing some fishing.I seen mostly the same as everyone else. The sky only had a few clouds in it.these clouds could be seen clearly due to the moon was high and bright.I came to notice the lights in the sky due to the fact they turned night into day...These where large white lights, Not like the flames of a rocket...As well as they appeared in the sky, Not launching from the ocean.. As I stated I was fishing,[There was nothing blocking my view}.. To me the lights seem to be almost conected as if part of one object. These lights seemed to be several miles off the coast of sebastian..These lights overpowered the moons light. I would clearly say these lights where brighter then a night time shuttle launch as well. They did not seem to move at all.Just stayed in one place,not moving like rocket..No sounds at all.The only sounds was of everyone on the jetty trying to figure out what it was..No rumble sounds like a rocket,no flames,no smoke. It seemed to me when the lights where going out they { Rolled Up }..They did not turn out..This is when it seemed to be one object to me. The way it just seened to roll up as if it was turning to the southeast..This is when things got loud. Several fighter jet {I would say comming Patrick Air Force Base} where not wasting any time heading in the direction where it the was..I had counted two groups of around 12 planes.. They where moving very fast, Yet I could see the flames coming from the jets.The planes came back by about 30 to 40 minutes later..This time flying much slower..I remimber people joking that they didn't get there in time,Or seen what it was and ran...The only naval operations I believe took place was to try to get a look at the object or odjects..Why would you send US jets to a test sight if they where launching missles? There is a no fly zone every time they have a launch at KSC...My farther was in the navy for over 25 years.I grew up in a navy life style I have see many launchs in my 36 years of life...This was no launch...This object I would say was the biggest thing I ever seen in the sky ...This is something my friend and me tells everyone we know..

For 65 years or more I've thought of this experience as a bad, bad nightmare.  The more I think of it the more it seems it was not a dream.  It was the most frighting thing in my life. 

I was about 4/5 years old when the first occurrance happened.  Two/three  creatures appeared in my bedroom at night.  They just came thru the wall and where there.  I was scared to the point of hysteria. 

The next thing I remember is we where going down the street away from my house towards the nearest corner.  There was their ""car,"" as I thought it was.  I noticed it was shiny like polished alumimun (not black like all the other cars I'd ever seen) and it appeared to me to be upside down!  The flat part was on top and the curved part on the bottom, like a half sphere upside down.

They wanted me to get in and I guess I did although I can't recall.  After that I was afraid to go to my room to sleep because I was fearful they would come back to take me.  I think they returned maybe 4 times.  I was always near frighted to death each time.  As best I can recall this was over a period of about 1 or 2 years.  Then they stopped coming.In my pre and teen years I was very prone to nose bleeds. 

This in its self was not remarkable except for one occurrence. I was having a particularly heavy nose bleed. and was leaning againist a building letting it just run freely.  Some thing came out of my nose and fell to the ground.  I didn,' pick it up because it was all bloody, but it was maybe a half to one inch long and shaped like a bullet.  I've always wondered about that. 

I am now 72 years old and have never spoke of this to anyone.  Am I nuts or imagining some thing??

Standing outside my apartment about to go in when I saw a bright flash of light that seemed to come from almost directly above me, in a sort of northerly direction.  As I turned to look I saw a streak of light falling from the direction of the flash (or seemed to be falling), downwards angle, towards the east.  The streak of light was shaped almost like a teardrop, and I'm pretty sure I saw it change color from a pure white to a bright orange before either disappearing or falling out of my point of view.  There was no sound, and the entire event lasted less than 5 seconds.  To be honest, I don't think it was a UFO, but I'm kinda hoping it IS one, because to my uneducated eyes, it looked like a missile or a plane exploding, either one of which would be bad....

The altitude at a guess at 2,000 feet high. This was seen on September 4, 1962 at 3:30 pm Central Standard Time. Location of sighting was 2.6 miles south of St. Louis Lambert airport. The sky was clear and wind was calm. My mother was hanging clothes out to dry, and called out to me to come out and see the object. I rejected her offer for some time, but she insisted that it was  something I should see. When I finally went out and saw the object we talked and she asked if it could be Venus? I told her that it could not be because of the time of day and direction was eastward.

I was a member of the St. Louis Astronomical Society at this time. My mom said I should get my telescope and take a look. At the age of 15 I wasn't totally coordinated yet, and I broke the front glass out of the front screen door. Trying to get the telescope out the door. I'm adding for the time frame. It took a bit of work to gather the broken glass up before a got the telescope to the back yard.

Setting up the telescope. It was a Tasco refractor 60 mm objective lens, with a alt-azimuth mount. I first used the wide angle eyepiece to spot the object. I found it magnified well, but still rather small. I let my mom look through the scope and by this time we had the next door neighbors over also. So now we have our own star party. Three adults and one kid.

I let everyone take there time and look. Of course they all asked if I could get it bigger. I set the 3 X barlow and the strongest eyepiece. This set the magnification of 525 power. When I looked at the object it nearly filled the entire field of view.  I can only explain that I had it focused perfect!  It looked like a cue ball.  No markings.  Perfectly smooth and rather off white, not shiny.  It did not give any glow off.  No sense of spinning motion, and no noise at all.

This is important. This object has not moved one nanometer in an hour of time. Nothing in the heavens or earth can do that!  When you view the moon at full power with that telescope it's like a big train moving by. This didn't move. I expected it to move and was in total disbelief at what I was seeing. I let my mom and the neighbors husband and wife both take long looks at the object and we all agreed that it was not moving. I kept saying this can't be happening! No one is going to believe me at the next Astronomical meeting. But I got witnesses!  Better yet I've done lunar eclipse photos, and said I will be getting my camera and special eye mount for it and I'll be back. Never had a chance to move.

When we look back at the time in history, it was as one of the worst in nuclear confutations. The ""Cuban missile crisis"" was happening. I no sooner said that I was going to get the camera when I hear a very load jet aircraft take off. Living for many year near the airport we grew accustomed to the different sounds of the commercial, and air force aircraft flying and even crashing near by as a F-86 did a mile down the road. This was the sound of afterburners and full throttle. As soon as the plane came above the tree line I spotted it as a B-47. She was doing a tight circle as we literality turned our bodies around as it circled and climbed for altitude. On the second sweep around I was beginning to wonder if it had something to do with our visitor in the sky above. I was a lucky hunch, because at that very moment I scream! Look it moved! What had been stationary for an hour did a sudden straight vertical movement to twice the altitude in a split second and stopped. The B-47 was still in hot pursuit with all engines at full throttle. It kept a circular pattern as she climbed up toward the object. After about the fourth revolution around the B-47 chase was over. I saw the object go from that second position to ascend straight up out of sight.

My mom insisted that I report this to the Air Force base at Lambert Field. I looked up a few numbers that sounded official and dialed them. When I mentioned I wanted to report a UFO, they responded I could get in a lot of trouble doing this. Did my parents know I was doing crank calls to the US Government? The last call I made I did get through to an Air Force official and said I wanted to report a UFO and it was being chased by a B-47. He said that's ridicules there's no B-47 aircraft in the air. I said if you don't believe me look out your window. He hung up quickly.  No report was ever made to the papers that I could ever recall.

Iwould like to know if anyone in the St. Louis area saw this object also.","Casino worker",4,1,"sphere",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1962,1960,3,9,15,"Afternoon","Midwest",0,1,0,0,0

Behind the property there is only scrubland leading up to the mountain range.At about 10.30 on a clear night apart from some patchy cloud I was in the backyard looking at the stars, my family were inside watching TV. I witnessed six or seven large bright lights that appeared to be flying in formation at about 5 thousand feet up. They were flying horizontaly. The ""head"" of each object was round with a blue and red luminous colouring. Their ""tail"" was remarkable and brilliantly gold coloured like a beautiful sunset. There was no noise. They headed west to east and ""blinked"" out simultaneously over the mountains.I have seen many firework displays and shooting stars but these could not be mistaken for either.I am not sure what they were. At the time I even considered that they were missiles. If someone could convince me that a meteor shower could fly horizontaly and appear so large and brilliant I might consider that an explanation but I am open minded and feel privilleged to have seen them.

I looked behind the last jet about, 2 to 5 miles, and saw a white cylinder flying at what appered to be the same height and speed. I pointed the object out to my friend and he also saw it. He said it looked like a missile but the object was blunt at both ends and was flying at the same speed as the airforce jets. Also there were no tail fins or wings at all.

a mirror like reflection of sun got my attention as it flew in from the S over the Pacific, it started to curve to the West then fly up the coast from me..I thought I would see wings but as it turned it was just a tubular fuselage. I grabbed binocs and that clinched it; no wings, and fire coming out the end: a missile.

 There are missile tests all the time around here what with Edwards and Point Mugu base nearby, but they have always been way out over the ocean -- not this time. I called the police station, and they said no one else had called it in, and they had no info.

any one have any idea what it could have been?? it seemed much bigger than a telephone pole, through the binocs at the time it seemed like it could be 30 to 50 feet, but could be smaller in reality..or larger.

But it absolutely did have flame out the back..

The flight seemed to be guided..not a straight line, or a curve...

I guess it is the most plausible explanation that it was a recently launched missile, perfectly possible I could have seen it during it's first 15 seconds of flight, launched from a jet or ship..it was going rather slowly at first..then I lost sight of it almost as soon as I focused the binos on it -- it may have picked up speed and zoomed out of sight in a few seconds..

Sorry about the dates and time only a rough guide.

The story takes place in my home village of balderton in the daytime on a summers day in broad daylight.

I was of the age of about ten years old and i was with my friend also strangley the vicars son.And my older brother whom was about 14/15 years old.

We had been at my late mum's friends house which is about 10 houses away from ours these gardens are bigish so the its eye view clearly but not a 2 second walk.

Anyway we was leaving my mum's friends house heading east back up the street towards my home at the time,i will just add to this our house took forward on a bend the street was straight until the end where it bent and left our house at the top eg if you turned and headed down the street you would crash into our house if you went dead straight and not followed the bend.

We was walking the birds where singing noise of cars etc in the distance this wasnt a busy street just a street on a estate in a village close to the countryside.so we could easy here summer noises the sun was shining and it was bright and by now the sun was at the side of us.

As we walked all the noises stopped enough to make us aware and glance round it was as if all had stopped there was a absoulte silence.

this went on for about 10 seconds until still heading towards our house feeling a little strange by it all when from nowwhere we all saw three missile shaped objects about well roof level aganist a 2 floor house and my parents house at that one went straight throught he roof and the other above only just and the other at slighty lower than the roof one but along side the house these where travelling north direction  moving at about 10mph at a size of about two buses in length and a double bus height made which looked a metallic material and of a dark metal colour these where shaped as a missile but with large fins one near the front a smaller a top one and a back one maybe more but the angle could only see these.and no noise and no flames etc the one which went through the house went straight through like a magician walking through a wall.

They carried on until they went out of sight from us behind the houses on or left then all returned to normal to noise the wind which also had seemed to still at the point of silence.

So we ran towards where the had flew hoping to see them from behind but they had gone no sign of them all was normal.With this we ran back to my late Mum's friends house telling my mum and friend about it with as expected oh right well done attitude.But we asked them about the stillness and they hadnt noticed anything.

When myself and my brother and friend reset off back towards my old house all was normal and when we entered our house all felt normal and looked that way to strange.

If anyone asked about was it aliens hey i dont know but my not knowing opinion would be i would say human the design shape metal colour looked human made how do i know this i dont just a what i think.maybe a dimesion shift or time travel silly thoughts more like, but kept me wondering all these years maybe i will never know.

Sorry for any bad spelling watching my kids and running back and forth writing lines when can.just to add i never saw a cockpit shape just one solid metal shape.

I did a film this morning with my vcr recorder, not a digital, and didnt want to use digital for this past two weeks we did use it, and the pixelization i think gets in the way of the value and stability of the real film of the object.

 I am speaking of a sighting that my friends and I had of what could only be explained as a UFO.  They told me that they had filmed the incident and I came over to see what they had,  My lead guitar player and myself joined our friend with our own camera the next morning when at approx. 5:15 not only did it do a repeat performance, but it was followed by another craft of approximately the size of 5 football fields.  The smaller craft looked like sparks in the early morning sky, and we didnt even know they were smaller craft until we slowed the film down to frame by frame, and were amazed to see many of them entering and leaving the larger craft.    The air around where they flew seemed to be mixed up like ripples in the water, it was like looking into water, and like someone took a sponge lightly dipped in paint and went over what was really there.  This cloaking activity seems inherent after sunrise, and the only time we have been able to actually SEE them is right at sunrise before the sun rises high enough over head for them to reflect the sky back at themselves.  So I went back again with my digital camera, which has filming capability for short spurts of time, and waited.  I almost thought (even though this was a week later) that I wouldnt see a thing, but right at 5:23 the sun started comingup and there they were , like they appeared out of nowhere, this one took off to the east.  I lost sight of it around Bailey hill, and figured Id have to wait another day, however as I got closer to home, (13 miles away from where we had photographed  them, I went under the train trestle down the street from my house, looked up and bigger than shit there it was.  I barreled down the driveway grabbed my camera and bolted up to the street in time to catch it on an .avi file.   The next day, my friend Bobby calls me and tells me that he caught it landing on the far side of the power plant, the far side of the power plant is delta of the Sacramento River, and an island that is mostly marsh and hazardous waste.  No one goes there, no one human anyway.

 I figured that since they were appearing close to the power plant that the draw of the electricmagnetic field had to have something to do with them appearing there over and over again.

So 4th of July, we went up and w atched fireworks from Bobbys back yard on the top of the hill above Bart in Pittsburg, California,  I took off at about 1 am telling them i was going to get my high powered telescope, my bushnells and my old fashined type of VCR recorder, you know the type that actually took the big VCR tapes to record?  I was back at 4 pm. setting up the telescope and the vcr recorder to watch the sky.  I had a feeling whatever we would see this day was going to be HUGE. and buddy i tell you what it was freaking HUMONGUS.  The size of the city of Concord at the very least. With hudreds of hundreds of the size flying ships that only days before we were referring to as ""mother ship""  WHAT A LAUGH!  OH MY GOD.  The video I got of it this morning, actually shows movement on the ship, shows crafts set to depart, on platforms that swing upwards to a sinister or forward slash direction, and when the ships departed, they didnt go straight up, the platform they rested on inclined, and these fast mother flockers left with the force and speed of a projectile,   what looked like might be a jet trail, turned out to be motion blur.  We found all kinds of sparks and fast movement in the sky that many were unable to be seen by the naked eye.  As a matter of fact, when you pointed the camera at them, you could not see the craft on the preview screen of the camera at all, and looking through the eyehole, they werent there either, we had to just point the cameras in the general direction, hit the zoom and width mode and even then sometimes couldnt see them until you slowed the film down by 900 percent.  i AM going to try to translate the film to my computer from the TV somehow and copy it to a DVD.  But I tell you what I am so blown away by the whole thing I dont even know what to think say or do.  The blow away at dawn was looking at what appeared to be an elogated fireball, with the multitude of disks and smaller craft, AND stationary ""buildings"" with activity able to be seen usning the zoom lense of the camera.

Report of Unusual Aerial Phenomenon Wednesday, July 12, 2006 Silver City, New Mexico As seen from near downtown Silver City.

 Around 5:00 A.M. saw from a north facing window, just overhead, at an angle 60 to 70 degrees to the horizon, and 30 degree east of due north, two  bright, unusual cloud-like objects. The sky was clear.  The larger object had a central section that was clearly glowing with rainbow colors. Long curlicues extended outward, mostly to the east. These crisscrossed repeatedly. Both objects gradually expanded, the curlicues especially extending over a large distance. Though the edges of the curlicues softened slightly over the next half hour, they maintained their distinctiveness, spreading to cover a vast portion of sky. The smaller object dissipated into a more cloud-like form, while the larger maintained its shape for a much longer time. Both objects were nearly stationary for several minutes, then began a gradual motion to the northeast, as though driven by the wind. Throughout all this time the ends of the curlicues appeared to be extending in length, creating sinuous patterns. The overall impression was of a ""chemical bomb"" slowly expanding and changing. Just after sunrise, around 6:20, the objects had almost completely dissipated, and were now far to the northeast, but could still be faintly seen covering almost the whole of the northern horizon, having expanded from a very tight center just over or to the north of Silver City to include the whole visible extent of the Gila Wilderness area. Note: the next day the news was full of reports that what observers had seen was the result of a successful antiballistic missile test over the White Sands testing area. However, White Sands is east of Silver City, and this phenomenon looked to be more to the north, over the Gila Wilderness area. Photos of this event were taken by the observers and others.

Additional information on an incident that took place at an Minuteman 1b silo at, Ellsworth afb, SD.

 The outer security zone  went off, follow by an inter security zone  alarm.

At that time the launch officer in charge of that site dispatched a strike team consisting of 2 Combat defence Team Members to investigate the intrusion at the silo.

At the time of their arrival they saw a (flying sausar) sitting on top of the launch tube door of the missile site, with small objects around the security pit.

I don't know what happend at that time, but what I do know is that the strike team left the site at a high rate of speed, down a very narrow 1 lane dirt or gravel road,with a spot of light parralling them. at some point they lost control of the pick-up truck they were driving, and rolled the truck totaling the blue truck the had been driving. I do not recall them being killed, but I believe that they were hurt.

I personal saw the truck after it was wrecked. It was totaled.

I also know that the base comander spent the text few day flying around in hellocopters, looking for (UFO'S) I ALSO KNOW THAT A LOT OF AIRMEN  SPENT THE EVENING HOURS STANDING ON THE TOP OF THE BARRACKS ROOF LOOKING FOR (UFO'S).

I WAS ONE OF THEM. I SAW NO (UFO'S) ONLY SATELITES.

I ALSO KNOW THAT ANOTHER MAINTANCE TEAM  WAS DISPACTED TO THE SILO IN QUESTION. FOR WHAT, I HAVE NO FIRST HAND KNOWLEGE WHY.

Sometime between 1971 and 1977 (I'm sorry that I can't be more specific, but we took so many trips to Florida back then and I didn't record the info), 

My then husband and I were travelling south through the Florida Keys.  As we were about to exit one of the bridges onto a Key, going South, on my right (the Gulf of Mexico side) I saw the bottom of a huge metallic ""Ship"" - that's the only way I can describe it, hovering near and just above a waterfront home rooftop, straddling the rooftop and the water.  It just hung there, just at a little above rooftop level.  

I could only see the bottom of it, as I remember the top of it was cloud or mist covered (although it was sitting not far off the ground).  There were lots of people already pulled over to the side of the road and out of their cars, gesturing and pointing towards it.  

I absolutely begged my then husband to please stop, stop, I wanted to look at it, but he wouldn't, just kept looking straight ahead with the pedal to the metal.  (I think he was scared to death).  I craned my neck as we drove by to see as best I could, and then it suddenly vanished.  

This happened so long ago, but I distinctly remember that whatever it was created absolutely no sound.  As to its shape, it looked to me like the rear end of a dirigible, only standing straight up, vertically.  Like the bottom of a missile.  Metallic gray.

She was taking a long time getting ready to go out for the evening so I went outside and laid on the hood of my 1970 Mercury Montego looking up at the evening sky.  There were some stars out, but not excessive.  After awhile I saw what I thought was a shooting star.  The star, however, stopped amazingly suddenly.  I figured that the actual shooting star must have disappeared behind a nighttime cloud and I must be focusing on a different star.  I kept my eye on it anyway.  It quickly became apparent that the star I was focusing on was something strange.  It was gyrating back and forth fairly rapidly.  After approx. 10-15 seconds of gyration the ""star"" shot across the sky just like a shooting star.  As a matter of fact, it looked no different.  It was too high up for me to make out any particular shape.  It was a white light just like all of the other stars.  I was sort of blown away but then I figured I must be tired and imagined what I saw.  Although I knew what I saw, I could not admit it to myself.  If made me sit upright on the hood.  I was going to get up to go tell my girlfriend what I saw when suddenly another shooting star raced across the night time sky just as the first one and stopped in the EXACT SAME PLACE!  Now I knew I was really seeing something very weird.  It also started gyrating, and traveled in a perfect little triangle pattern, stopped for a minute, gyrated, and took off in the same projectile direction as the first, looking just like a shooting star.  One again, I was about to run into the house to tell my girlfriend what I was witnessing.  The adrenaline was flowing and my heart was pounding.  A third came out of the night sky, stopped in the same place, raced around in a circle (not a triangle) and split really fast just like the first two.  I did not wait around to see it there were any more.  Now I wish I did.  I ran into the house and yelled to my girlfriend, Where is a phone book?  I need to call the Hudson police department.  She sort of freaked out and yelled, what's wrong!!?  Still in the shower, she could not come down.  I saw one of those emergency stickers on the side of her phone and called the Hudson police dept., hear pounding out of my chest.  When someone answered and asked if it was an emergency, I got a grip.  I realized that I cannot embarrass myself by reporting UFO sightings.  That would be absurd.  I hung up.  I never reported it.  My girlfriend politely acknowledged what I saw, but I think that was the beginning of the end. Looking through her eyes, I think she thought I was nuts.  This was either on a Friday night or a Saturday night.  When I got to work on Monday I could not help but to confide in a coworker and tell him my story.  He laughed and said, your full of shit, you read the paper.  I asked him what he was talking about.  He said that there were several UFO sightings reported over the weekend in NH.  None were reported in Massachusetts according to my coworker.  The only one I remember him describing to me was a low down light in a field in NH and other low altitude sightings?  It did not sound like what I saw but the same weekend, never the less.  I tried, tonight, 23 years later, to try to substantiate this to my wife by Google'ing a search for New England UFO sightings hoping to find a newspaper article.  I did find this:  7/7/81 Pittsfield Darryl S. Perrault, 18, Carl E. Perrault, his father, and Ann Delsignore, his girlfriend, saw a UFO through binoculars for 45 minutes. When first seen, it shot across the sky like a meteor, then suddenly stopped. Darryl said, ""It was oval-shaped, with red and white flashing lights around the outside like a ring. No way it was a plane or a sattelite- it shot across the sky too fast."" N.E. UFO Newsletter #23 Oct. 1981 p. 18  Seems pretty darn similar.  My search was prompted because myself, my wife and my two daughters watched a UFO special on TV and my wife said, girls, don't believe any of this crap.  I of course encouraged them to keep an open mind.  I am a college educated individual who had nothing to gain by making up a story.  I am speaking the absolute truth.

He tells this story over and over without any discrepancies in his story. At times he gets excided when he tells it because he relives the experience. He has forgotten the exact time the encounter happened and to the best of his knowledge he thinks it was about Nov. 1978 but is possible could be a few years off.

He got really spooked and took off fast across the field bouncing around until he got to the cotton gin. He jump out of the truck with the truck still rolling and went in and told his boss and others and they all came out and saw the spinning craft drift to the side of the gin across Hwy 87. People where really spooked at this site and some went back inside.

 Also some people in their cars on the hwy stopped and people got out of their cars and where looking at this low spinning disk. It was about 500 Ft high with spinning lights all around...yellow, red, and blue.

 Then it slowly began to pull up and then a bright beam of light shot down from the center as it moved up. My step father then said the cotton gin's power and the machinery inside then just died off and shut down. Then the craft pulled up higher and the white beam of light turned off and then it shot upward like a bullet till it was out of sight. The power at the cotton gin then came back on.

 He tells me of another story that happened around Odessa and Andrews, Texas. He had heard of a farmer who would see this craft on a regular bases follow the power lines toward the mountains from west Texas toward the New Mexico but his memory of the story and the details are almost gone.

 He had heard one farmer saw this craft and reported it and the police came out. They did not believe this farmer. He said even some military folks where there but they really doubted the farmers story.

 Just then a rancher driving to his ranch stopped by to see what all the commotion was about. After they told him he said oh yea...he would the the craft ride above the power lines toward the mountains all the time.

 I talked to some other people and they also claim to have seen a spinning craft follow low and close behind them one evening as they where between Sweetwater and Abilene, Texas on Interstate 20 back in the 80's so maybe there is or was a craft  that hung around west Texas in the 70's and 80's

The fact that you all have not posted this story makes it clear to me that you all think this is a hoax. Let me state that I know this man personally and I can vouch for him that what he saw that night was an experience he will always remember. I really do think this story should be noted online because there where witnesses and just maybe they might see the story and come forward. I really hope you all reconsider your evaluation of this report and post it.

 Here is the story again:  I have a step father who is almost 70 years old. He has a UFO story that I think needs to be told just incase someone else out there might have been a witness can come forward with more info. He tells this story over and over without any discrepancies in his story. At times he gets excided when he tells it because he relives the experience. He has forgotten the exact time the encounter happened and to the best of his knowledge he thinks it was about Nov. 1978 but is possible could be a few years off.

 He happened to be working in a cotton gin in a town called Arvana, Texas just NE of Lamesa, Texas.  He remembers being out one evening in the field driving a truck when off to the horizon coming to him drifting over the trees was a spinning disk object with lights around. He got really spooked and took off fast across the field bouncing around until he got to the cotton gin. He jump out of the truck with the truck still rolling and went in and told his boss and others and they all came out and saw the spinning craft drift to the side of the gin across Hwy 87.

This happened during an Army ROTC training weekend in a large wooded area on base. 

While on a land navigation exercise in the woods at about 2 am, perhaps 3-ish, two other people in my fire team and I witnessed a large ball of light traveling slowly over the treetops. there was a very high pitched humming noise. 

Our compasses were not working, but using terrain association we figured that it was heading roughly north/northeast, at maybe 10-20 mph.  It was moving much too slowly to be a missile or other projectile that I've ever seen, and was far too close to have been mistaken for a helicopter or an airplane. 

We have not reported this incident to anyone, although I have heard from other cadets in the NR Battalion besides those in my squad/fireteam that saw the same object early that morning.  

It passed almost over us, and I could not discern its shape, it was only a ""blob"" of light.","Student/ Army ROTC",3,1,"light",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2006,2000,4,10,2,"Night","South",0,1,0,0,0

November 15, 2006									  National UFO Center  Report from sighting on November 5, 2006 at approximately 12:30am  

I live in Tomball, Texas? northwest of Houston about 40 miles. I am 44 years old. I was asked to give my credentials and experience with a couple of projects at NASA and Lockheed Martin. I have been a graphics designer for over 20 years and have done several special projects for NASA. One being the Consolidated Space Operations project, CSOC, in the early 90?s. 

Also, I designed and edited the White Sands Missile Range Project proposal, the first full color proposal ever presented to NASA by Lockheed Martin.  

I was educated on space operations, satellites, etc, etc. I was exposed to and had access to many reports about ongoing UFO projects and experiments involving NASA.  I know that I am not an expert but I believe that I know more than the average observer and have a bit more of an open mind to the possibilities. 

Also, my father is a retired commercial airline pilot and has taught me a lot about space, meteorology and what is and is not ?possible?.  We have watched many planes in the sky. I consider myself a liberal thinker and am not ignorant nor naive to the possibilities beyond my comprehension. I spend a lot of time outside at night observing the sky and know the difference between airplanes, satellites, stars and ?flocks of geese?! I was certainly not expecting or looking for what I saw, but I can assure you that it was none of the before mentioned!!  I have never seen what I am about to do my best to explain to you or anything remotely similar and am very interested to know if there were any other reports of the same.

 My eighteen year old daughter and I were outside at about 12:30 am that night. The sky was clear, the moon appeared to be full with a large, hazy circle around it and was directly above us, a bit northwest. There were a few clouds and scattered stars. We were looking southeast in the sky and noticed a bright light moving rapidly. It appeared to be at least 40 thousand feet up, perhaps higher. It was moving at a high rate of speed. In less than 5 minutes it had gone from just above the tree line, our horizon line, to directly above us.

 To describe it best is to say that the ones that were closest to us were shaped much like an ant?s body, two parts connected. We first saw one and thought it to be a satellite. I know the basic movements in conjunction with Earth and placement of the satellites and these were much too close in placement to be satellites. I considered the fact that it was much too fast and much too high to be an airplane. As we were looking I noticed another one a little further south, then another further east. There were 4 or 5 all together at about the same height and were spread out across the sky and moving at the same rate of speed.

 As I was watching and trying to somehow justify and explain them I noticed just beyond these were another ?layer? several thousand feet above them (smaller and dimmer) moving at the same rate of speed and the same direction. As we were watching I noticed another 3 or 4 come out from the tree line into view. They seemed to be following the others?again, at the same rate of speed and closer, as the first 4 or 5. In total there were at least 20, perhaps more in the distance. All moving the same direction, in a wide-spread, horizontal formation and all going the same rate of speed. Within 5 minutes they were all directly above us.

 My daughter became frightened when I was not able to ?explain? them to her and went into the house. I watched them for just another minute or so and went in to report them. It was then that I found your website. I made the call the next morning and was called back on Monday, November 6th and asked to give this report.

 I apologize for taking an extra few days to get you my account. I am, however, very interested to know of anyone else that saw them that night or any other night.

 I am encouraging my daughter to put together her own account of what we saw that evening. It has opened her eyes to the possibilities beyond explanation. We have spoken a lot about what we witnessed and are positive it was something worth doing our best to report. Thank you for the work that you are doing.","Graphics Designer / Artist",2,0,"formation",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2006,2000,4,11,1,"Night","South",0,1,0,1,0

There was a very thin cloud layer in the sky that did NOT obscure the stars.  The object was above this layer and I attribute its hazy appearance to that fact.  

The light moved rapidly from a higher to lower altitude and seemed to follow a trajectory that made an angle of about 30 degrees with the ground.  From my vantage point at approximately 1250 feet in elevation, it appeared that the object was about 5 miles, or so, distant, and located over the Redstone Arsenal.  The object covered a large arc of sky in the very short time in which I viewed it.

 The object gave the impression it would impact the ground somwhere south of my location.  I can see about 40 miles due to my mountain-top location.  I waited for several minutes for a sign of impact, but saw none.  The Alabama counties in which an impact could have taken place are Morgan and Marshall.  No sound from the object was audible.

 I had attributed my sighting to a meteor, until a local newspaper ran an article about a similar sounding object that was seen a day later at a much earlier time (11/28/06 at 17:28).

 Search lights, flares, rockets, missiles, and aitcraft are unlikely explanations for this object.  Humidity in the air would make search light beams visible and the shape of the spot on the clouds would have changed due to the angle of the light source.  The object maintained constant shape.  The apparent altitude and angle of sky covered would likely indicate supersonic velocity and probably a sonic boom, especially if the object had to avaoid collision with the ground.  The sudden appearance and disappearance of the object, and its constant luminance would also help rule out the other possibilities I mentioned.","NASA Engineer/ Manager",1,1,"fireball",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2006,2000,4,11,22,"Night","South",0,1,0,0,0

Hello This is the 1st time I've ever seen anything like this before.  

But let me start by telling you about myself.I live in Fairfield, CA and  I am 19 years old. 

The way the sightning began was. I was first driving in my car going home to my apartment around 11:45pm on December 5th 2006 and I saw a red firework go off in the sky toward the Air Base(I actullay have no clue if it was an actual firework; It looked like a regular big red firework alot of red little dots in a circle shape). And then the trees blocked my veiw. I immediatly told my girlfriend. She kinda got excited and wanted to see. So I told her toward to look toward Travis(AFB). We hit a couple corners toward the house and had an open view and no fireworks... So we get into my apartment parking lot and shes still looking back for the fireworks. And I notice a red light in the sky straight infront of us while I was driving toward my parking space. My girlfriend tells me... ""Do you see that?"" I replyed with a confirmed face and nod. ""What is that?"" It looked to be a ""Red Star"" very bright. Like a dot or light. I hit a corner in my parking lot and parked to get out to look. There it is... a weird red star looking thing. So I call a homeboy accross town to instruct him to go outside and look toward my apartments. This is around 11:50pm He does and laughs. ""What is that?"" No Clue. A red light shining in the sky. Shortly after I called him the red dot started pulsing.. Slowing... But pulsing. Bright and Dim. While I was on the phone with him a white light came from the middle of the red dot and shot BRIGHT real fast and a white line traced down from the bottom. It looked like a white tracer bullet but shot out and only went a very short distance away from the bottom of the red light. I was still on the phone with my homie and he had 3 people with him that all seen it. After the white light shot down, it was once again solid red. I then noticed it was moving down slowly. I got off the phone with my friend and then my girlfriend cal! led her mother. Told her and she had 3 other people with her. We all seen it there are 9 of us in 3 different parts of town. When it dissapered it started moving to the right and then started to pulse faster but still slow.(Maybe  each about 700ms"") and then did the same thing the white tracer line thing did and shot down about an inch in my eyes and dimmed away with a consistant pulse. It all happend for about 10 minutes It stopped about midnight to the minute. What I think happend if it was an alien =P. Is that of course they would be smart and they wouldnt go into lightspeed parallel from us. They would go away from us...

It disappeared and reappeared x 3, but the jet stream remained behind it. At one point it burst into bright fireball light and disappeared, but reappeared again.  I woke my husband and son to see it.  By the time my son woke up there was only the wide spiraling jet stream. Mu husband saw the light object.  It reminded me of a comet, but appeared to be traveling parallel to the earth's surface and not toward it. It did not appear to be getting closer to the ground when it disappeared.  It also reminded me of the space shuttle and one was launched Dec. 9. .  I also read that the military launched a new stealth jet yesterday.  Any of these may be possibilities, but it was certainly special to watch.  I hope this helps.

Looking out the window to the southeast I first noticed an interesting very squiggly contrail line.  It was very well formed and concise and looked like it was fresh.  It started about 30 degrees above the horizon and continued down to the horizon squiggling the whole way down.  I couldn't tell if the line was dropping in altitude or just going to the distant horizon.  This eratic contrail line disipatted after 20 minutes from my first viewing.  It looked like it may have been from some kind of rocket that had no (or little) guidance system - just so erating and many times finely looping on itself.  It also was 90 degrees to the norm of contrails that normally form this time of day as we have much commercial traffic heading west at this time of day.

 Shortly after first noticing the out of the ordinary contrail I saw what I thought appeared to be a comet moving not really fast to the east at about 90 degrees to the from the contrail.  Again at this time of morning everything is normally moving to the west.  This is the object I observed for about 30 seconds, with my wife seeing it for about the last 15 of those seconds (it took time to get downstairs to notify her).  The whole object was the size of about half my pinky nail held out at arm's length.  The object had a haze behind the direction of travel (all this contained in the size discription given).  My wife and I watched it eventually fade away as it moved to the distance.

 My pictures I'm sending are of the eratic / squiggly contrail line.

This is to update my previous report:  THE OBJECT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.  It was a rocket that took off from Wallops Island, VA two hundred miles south of here.  The eratic contrail was from the exhaust from the rocket and the object was the rocket itself.  Thgis has been reported to the local TV station.

Driving east from Mt. Vernon on rt.36 southwest of Danville, at approximately 1:00 on the lower 1/3 of the sky , I observed a glowing fireball the size of a streetlight. As it got brighter a 6"" circle of the sky began to glow light blue as if in a haze. It expanded like a balloon then faded out.  Shockwave? The light then went out and re -ignited, then went out again leaving a zig zag contrail similiar to the challenger contrail. The contrail glowed in the morning dawn for 15 min. I thought, space junk, meteor, or a jet plane had exploded. It looked like a failed rocket launch on the horizon. I have seen no info yet but others driving east must have seen it. It was huge. No sound or shockwave felt.

Observed in eastern sky a large bright slow moving object with great luminoscity and as bright as the moon.  Appeared to be high in the atmosphere, since the object appeared to be shrouded in fog or haze.  Object was able to be observed over hilltop, so was not low on horizon, but probably 30/35 degrees above horizon.  A large tail of what appeared to be rocket exhaust plume was seen high rising high into the sky and lower on the horizon to the south east of the object.

Similar in behavior and speed to commercial airliner, but with only one contrail while flying, but odd for its time of day, apparent altitude (seemingly lower than trans-atlantic jet airliner), and flight corridor - no airplanes have ever been seen flying at that altitude, and certainly no trans-atlantic commercial jets.  After returned (20 seconds away) from getting my camera, the contrails (which had been straight) were wavy due to wind (no doubt), but the odd thing is that the UFO was still shining bright - probably reflection of the sun - sun was rising, but hadn't yet risen, but was apparently stationary.  It faded over the next minute.  I have a couple of photos of this.

This light then just vanished. When I mean vanish, I do not mean it took off in any direction at a high speed. it just vanished as though a port hole closed that leads to another dimention.

Was a clear morning sky. We were westbound going to meet freinds to go golfing. As we approached Reading,Pa. we noticed a vapor trail that appeared to be vertical to approx. 15,ooo ft than appeared to take a 90 degree turn to the west. The vapor trail was straight up and down but the horizontal vapor trail changed direction several times in an erractic succession. Upon meeting our freinds they were baffled as to what they saw. They asked us if we saw the vapor trail. They were much closer to it than we were, in fact they were transferring golf clubs into another car in a parking lot when they saw what they described as a small round object launch extremely fast , as a rocket would launch, vertically.It than seemed to drop back towards them at which time it again rose very rapidly and than turned on a dime toward the west and quickly disappeared to the west. They described it as a round metallic object that was very hard to see due to its extreme speed. What was apparent was its vapor trail off of both sides of it. They also said it was extremely silent. The desciption of their sighting was exactly what we saw from approx. 10 miles away. We were hoping that someone else also had this sighting, as it was very strange indeed.What bothers me is when something this apparent is not publicized ,it seems others must have seen it also. I have never seen anything like it nor would I ever imagine ever witnessing anything so surreal.

My friend and I had split up and were settling in for the moring deer hunt. He was probably a half mile from me and saw the entire happenings.

As I had walked to my position where I was going to sit and wait for Whitetail deer (about 50 yards from a large wood line in a picked soybean field) I looked over at a beautiful red horizon where the sun was going to be rising soon, As I looked I saw what appeared to be jet contrails coming from almost directly from where the sun was about to rise. For a split second I didn't think a thing about it but just as quick I thought it was strangely low in the horizon to be contrails. Now the contrail seems to moving very fast and right at my frined and myself. Suddeny the contrails stopped and now I could see one very bright light. This light, now no longer producing contrails seemed to be at a very high rate of speed and was still heading right at us.

the next thing that happend really shocked me. I continued to watch and suddenly the light stops. Not right over top of me but still out in front  of me and was now lower than at any other point. My guess would be 500 to 700 feet. Just as it stopped the single light seemed to begin growing. The light grew and it wasn't just light but a mist or fog seemd to growing within this ever expanding light. It still was not moving. In much less than 1 second, the misty light or large circle of light disappeared and once again it was just this single light hovering. Then in another split second the single light turned into a larger starburst light! Now the object is moving slowly to my left (North) But it may not have been moving directly left as it didn't get smaller in size or seem farther away as you would expect an oject to do as it moved along to my left. I thought it may have actually been moving to my left and slightly forward.

I conituned to watch it and just then my phone, which is set on vibrate, begins to do so. I answered it and it was my buddy asking me if I was watching this too. I said of course. As we were talking about the events we just saw the light seemed to be fading away. But not really fading as if it was moving away and becoming faint.

This was not the case at all. It was simply disappearing. It looked as if was slipping behind a curtain. It started to disappera on the Sunburst right side and continue to move towards that side until the whole thing was gone.

Someone may think it was cloud it slipped behing. Nope....There wasn't a cloud in the sky on this beautiful Saturday morning. It was crystal clear with thousands of stars out. This thing just slipped away into thin air! My friend and I contued to discuss this for quite sometime before we started to think about actually hunting.

I have always loved airplanes. I model them and go to airshows all over a three state area around Ohio. I am somewhat fimiliar with any aircraft, it's lighting and and it movement. This couldn't have been the movement of any aircraft I have ever seen. I think We certainly would've heard some prop or jet sounds. Not close of course, as even airliners that are very high in the sky can be heard at 7:00 am in the middle of a large area where there is nothing but crops and woods.

My wife and I were driving east bound on the Pennsylvania turnpike.  the sun was just coming up and the sky at the horizon level was a deep red. Further east ,where the contrails originated,were erratic as it moved west. at this point we noticed a very bright light,like a burning magnesium ball, moving west and the up and then as if it burned itself out but only to reappear again as a white ball and then again burn itself out. The contrails were white against a red background and were there for quite a while. We were driving from Cleveland,Oh to Johnstown Pa when this happened.

I was on a date with my girlfreind, and we were walking back to her car. We were talking then she suddenly stopped, and told me to look at the sky because she saw somthing strange. What we saw were 5 lights flying through the sky very quickly and in strange patterns. The pattern is hard to describe, they would would speed up to very high speed and slow down very quickly. The outside four in the formation  They weaved back and forth like a school of fish swiming in the water. My girlfreind described them as ""space fish""  The event lasted about 30 seconds then they faded away. Neither of us had a camera on us, so we were unable to capture any footage.

I was standing in line at a Zellers store in Fergus Ontario with 8 or 9 other people waiting for the store to open.  We were all aware that they would have the video game system we all wanted for xmas so we had to be in line before the store opened or we would not get it.  I showed up at 2:00 am and others arrived after that.  

At 6:30 I happened to be looking south toward the city of Guelph.  I saw what I thought at first was someone setting off a firework or flare.  A reddish orange ball shot up from the ground leaving a smoke trail underneath it.  When it reached it's apex in the air, it moved slowly east and then west and back to the east in a circle.  There was also a smoke trail of a circle where this manoever had occured.  Then the object just blinked out and dissapeared.  

I asked if anyone else in line had seen this and they all said yes.  There was many comments on how it was really weird.  There was no clouds in the sky that it could have gone behind or anything and like I said it did not shoot off in any direction it just dissapeared.  

Someone mentioned that they wondered if it was some sort of a plane that was having a problem.  Someone else mentioned that they had heard there was solar flares occuring that day.  

As all this commotion was going on the object suddenly appeared again exactly at the point where it had dissapeared.  This time though it was no longer red and orange it was a silvery colour.  

The object had 2 red lights and a white light visible on it. Then a bright white light shot out of it.  Not towards the ground but out horizontally.  

The light was brighter than any lights I have ever seen it was like a huge floodlight of some sort.  The light shone out from a single point but created a wide triangular like arc in the sky.  

I then realised that I had my cellphone on me and I could take a picture of this object.  I fumbled getting out my cellphone to take a picture.  The object had now been visible this second time for approximately 30 seconds.  I snapped a picture of it and as soon as I snapped the picture about 1 second later it dissapeared again.  It did not shoot off real fast or anything, again it just dissapeared.  It left no smoke trail or anything showing which direction it went.  But the original smoke trail it left when it raised from the ground originally stayed visible for approximately 10 minutes.  

None of us had ever seen anything like this before and none of us could explain away what it really was.  I do know one other person in line personally but I do not know who the other people are.  

However when the store opened and we got our video game systems we all had to leave our name and phone number so Zellers does have a record of everyone who saw this event if you would like to research this further.  

I do not know how to get this picture to you but if you are interested in seeing this picture I still have it in my cellphone and if I am contacted you can explain to me how I can get this photo to you.","Campground Owner",10,1,"changing",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2006,2000,4,12,6,"Morning",NA,0,1,0,0,0

Shortly after waking up I went out on my front porch to have a cigarette. It was still mainly dark but dawn was just beginning and you could still see the stars and moon. The sky was almost completely clear with only the odd low wispy cloud. After maybe 30-45 seconds the object caught my attention as I was looking in an E.S.E. direction. It appeared to be quite large although it's hard to say how high and how far away it was- I will guesstimate it at 4 to 10 miles away and at an altitude from 6 to 12 thousand feet. The object was a general triangle shape however the ""front"" seemed to stick out slightly in a semi-circle protuberance. The closest thing I can compare it to is a badminton birdie that has been flattened and then had its back flared end cut straight across to form 3 straight sides but with the rounded rubber end sticking out at the front somewhat. The object was travelling downward at about a 55 degree angle very smoothly at a fairly slow speed- it almost seemed to float or slide through the sky. The object made no noise and seemed to be made of white light or was luminescent. It's colour was very close to the bright moon's although it seemed to be less substantial- as if there was no actual physical{steel,aluminum...} structure to it. - The light reflects off of the moon so you can see it but this thing seemed to consist of light itself. It retained its clear shape for about seven seconds with no contrail and then over about the last 3 seconds it sort of slowly, uniformly shimmered and faded out of the absolutely clear sky- it just disapearred out of thin air and I was left there literally with my jaw hanging open. I was in awe of it and was excited,stunned,bewildered,delighted and in disbelief all at the same time. After about 30 seconds had gone by and I was pretty sure it wasn't going to reappear I ran inside to check the exact time and try to process what I had just witnessed. I can say that I am 100% convinced that it was some kind of craft utilizing technology far beyon! d what t he world's public is aware of. E.T. or us?????

He was using a digital camera and the photos were made as fast as the camera would cycle.There is an aircraft con-trail visible in the background that seems to go approximately North to South.

My friends and I we're standing outside our high school waiting for a school bus. I saw a white smokey trail come out of the southern horizon quite a distance away from us. I would have to guess on the order of several miles or more. At first I thought it was some type of rocket lifting off, the zig zagging of the trail indicated that. The trail abruptly cut off after a few minutes of rising. Then a minute or so later a second trail appeared going up in the same way about a thumb width away from the first trail. The second one rose much higher. I measured it with my hand on its side, it went up a little more than the width of my hand then vanished. A few seconds passed, and another trail appeared above the trail that had just cut off. I assumed it was the same object, but I could see a glowing bright light at the tip unlike in the previous trails. The sun was up above the horizon and to my left. The bright light flew to the west for a few seconds and then stopped and stood still. A large haze started to come from the object, spreading out to make a sphere of haze that was by my guess a mile wide. This haze stood in the air for at least five minutes after the light had vanished. The trails had not dispersed when I had gotten on the bus and stopped looking. I looked at a clock, it had been twenty minutes.

 There were about six of us there who all saw it. Two adults and four teenagers including myself. Later when we got to a speech tournament, my coach had talked to a coach from Akron (a full 30 miles away from Canton) whose students had also described to her an identical event.

I was driving home from a party with four friends the sat morning before christmas around 7a.m.  When one of my friends said is that a plane.  I was driving n look up n there was this lit object moving very fast in the most metaphysical ways.  Up down n back around.  It stopped in the sky in the clouds n got bright as the sun.  it was still dark out so it lit up the sky.  this was very frightening.  it looked like a black canopy with a hole cut in it with light on the other side. I thought it might b a nuke.  Then I saw two fighter jets fly toward it then it dissapeared.  The smoke trail it left was incredible. Figure eights, zig-zags, then at the top a perfect 3d cube.  None of our phones would work to take a pic.  Well bout five to nine fighter jets began flying straight up then down and all over all morning.  I was in seven 11 parkin lot n pointed them out to bystanders, who at the time were oblivious.  they were shocked at the site of the fighter jets.  I was so excited by the incident, that i called my dad to tell him of the events, n to c if he could see the jets.  I called my exgirlfriend who lives in philadelphia, n she said there were a bout 8 fighter jets in the sky up there, this was around 9a.m.  My dad called back and said there had been a newsflash of the reports.  The media said that the government shot off two missles off of an island off of virginia.  They made no mention of why, and made no other mention of it.  They blamed the smoke trail on the weather.  The smoke trail itself was incredible because it sat in the air for a good ten minutes.  

i have met six other people than my friends that witnessed the same event.  The fighter jets were in the sky until dark.  My exgirlfriend told me that she saw on the news that they were saying they released a new fighter jet that day, explaining why they were in the sky.  Y did the government shoot off rockets for no reason, then have fighter jets go after it.  The hole the others from the ohare airport describe sounds similar to ! the ligh t n how it dissapeared.  It was the most amazing thing my eyes have seen.  They cant deny the truth forever. 1

I was driving home from work on Ring Rd. in Elizabethtown Ky.  I was listening to the radio...just watching the road in front of me.  It was 7:20 am.  It was dawn but not quite light yet.  The sky was still a deep blue color.  Clear weather, no clouds.  Off in the horizon at about a 60 degree angle from myself, a bright blue light appeared to come around the curvature of the earth on the left of me and continue on a direct course until it disappeared around the curvature of the earth on the other side of the horizon approximately 2-3 seconds later.  The color of the light was about that of a blue LED light that people use to decorate the hoods of their cars with.  It was deep, bright....almost neon.  It truely looked almost exactly like a LED light.  It could tell it was very far in the distance and high in the sky based on it's position relative to the horizon.  This thing was booking it.  The speed it must have been travelling to transverse the entire curvature of the horizon from one side to the other in 2-3 seconds is mind boggling.  Even at the distance I was, the light appeared to be about 3-4 times larger than a bright star in the night sky...ofcourse that's my own comparison, it was already dawn so there were no stars visible behind it to directly compare it's size to.  I was very far away and listening to the radio so no sound.

I woke at 2:00 am and, looking out of my bedroom window, I noticed a bright white object moving slowly through the sky.  I was looking N/NW and the object appeared to be traveling east toward Winston-Salem, NC.  It appeared to be about 20-30 miles away but it was hard to tell and was flying at a height that I usually associate with local planes and jets that are landing at the airport in Winston.

It caught my attention that the object (which I assumed to be a plane) didn?t seem to have any of the usual lights required for aircraft.  I lost sight as the object passed on the side of my house so I got up and went to a large window in the front of my house (which faces east) to see the object as it came back into view.  It seemed to turn slightly south and I could finally see a flashing red light on it but the flash was not steady but rather erratic.

I watched it for 15 more seconds or so and then (to my amazement) a white light that I can only describe as looking like a missile (or a laser) shot out from the bottom straight toward the ground.  Needless to say, a burst of adrenaline went through me!  At first I thought a plane had dropped a bomb on the outskirts of Winston and that we might be under attack on our on soil---I stood looking at the sky for awhile and observed nothing else unusual.  The object traveled on and I lost sight of it in the tree line.

The next morning I had to travel to Tennessee and when I arrived at my parents? home, I asked them if anything had been said on the news about a bomb (or whatever) being dropped near Winston-Salem------that?s how unnerved I was.

After attending a movie in Poughkeepsie,NY.,a friend and I were traveling N/E on Rt. 55. I was a front seat passenger and noticed a very bright light about 30 degrees off the treeline to the S/E. It appeared to be several miles off, but I commented something about a helicopter. The driver looked in the direction I mentioned and we both saw it move with lightening speed maintaining the same latitude, across the windsheild and stop about the same distance in the N/E direction. This occured West of Pouquague approximately. We were both pretty amazed, but chalked it off as to just one of those things.

 We were traveling a short cut across what we referred to as East Mountain Road to reach our destination of Wingdale, New York. At the top of this mountain, there is a farm on a plateau. On the N side of the road, the main house sits about 100 ft. from the road. Directly across is a barn and some out buildings ( a barn mainly) that sits directly off a 15 foot shoulder.

 As we reached the top of the hill, we noticed a large illuminated object hovering beside the house. initially, it appeared to be amorphorus. Undefined, but brilliant. The base of the object appeared to be off the ground but level with the second story of the house. The top of the object faded into the haze so we had no idea where the top of the object ended. It was very close to the house which gave us a little perspective. It was at least 5 times the size of this 2 story farm house. While it was not touching the ground, it seemed ""at rest"" hovering beside the house and remained there.

 I told the driver to turn off the headlights as we grew closer, and instructed him to pull onto the shoulder by the barn so we could take it all in. He turned off the motor and  we just stared. We were both terrified at the scale of this object. The top of the mountain was very dark. There were no lights coming from either the house or the out buildings. There was no moonlight and it was slightly hazy.

 We sat there for about 15 minutes. There was no noise except for a very low frequency the I can only describe as ""feeling"" the sound rather than hearing it.

 At this point, my friend decided he was going to get out of the car and investigate it closer. He opened the door and started to get out when the noise because more audible. I panicked, and literally tore the sleeve from his shirt to restrain him from getting out of the vehicle. I turned the key and started the car motor and told him to drive. I also told him to leave the lights off until we began our descent down the other side of the plateau, which we did. We were both so frightened we wanted leave quickly, but it was like groping for a light switch in the dark.

 The East Montain Road is very steep and there are several hairpin turns. The mountain pass runs parallel to a deep ravine. From some places on the road, you cannot see the bottom of the ravine (in daylight) and as we were heading down, shortly after we turned on the headlights again, I noticed something glinting in the ravine below. The reflective(?) object was not stationary and seemed to be traveling slightly ahead of us but with us. It was shiny, and traveling like a bullet, only sideways. We were going to try to find a place to pull over again, to let it move on when it seemed to shoot down the ravine on an S shaped course and disappeared. In a S/E direction very similar to the object we saw initially on Rt. 55. This however was NOT the object we saw by the house. These were, in my opinion, two different objects.

 We vowed never to discuss this with anyone because of the stigma attached. We were both New York State officials at the time. I honestly don't know why I'm reporting this now, so many years later, but I am still stunned by it to this day when I think about it, and at least I have it off my chest.

UFO?s seen over South Shore sky By Andrew Pereira

It's hard to draw a surfer's attention away from the next wave, but whatever was in the northwest sky Friday evening around 6:20 p.m. drew a crowd along Kewalo Basin and Ala Moana Beach Park.

Honolulu resident Peter Hollingworth described as two lights circling in the sky, about 45 degrees above the horizon.

Video of one of the lights was recorded from the Channel 2 SkyCam.

""These two little fireballs with a stream behind it,"" said Hollingworth.  ""Looked kind of like a shooting star, but it just kept going. They changed directions a few times, at first it was coming in then it turned, Then it went out then it came back in again""  Hollingworth was surfing with his 12 year old son when the unexpected show began.

""I was a little concerned. I told him come over and sit with me - this might be the last surf session we ever have together because this thing's coming straight for Honolulu.  It looked deadly to me it was kind of spooky.""   So what was it?  The National Weather Service says nothing showed up on their radar at the time of the sighting and the Federal Aviation Administration didn't report anything unusual.

The U.S. military conducted a missile defense test off of Kauai Friday evening but the test didn't begin until 7:20 p.m.

""This in a sense is an unidentified flying object,"" said University of Hawaii astronomy professor Gareth Wynn-Williams.  ""It's something in the sky that's moving that we haven't identified.""  Wynn-Williams believes there's a simple explanation behind the UFO?s.

""It's probably a contrail of some kind,"" he said while watching video of one of the lights at his Kailua home.

The professor says contrails are caused by high flying airplanes burning hydrogen based fuels. One of the byproducts of the fuel exhaust is water.

""The air is very cold so the water condenses and forms like drops very quickly and then these drops stay behind the plane until eventually they warm up and they evaporate.""  Wynn-Williams doubts little green men from Mars are behind the UFO?s.

""Some people just think differently than scientists and they like to look for the fanciest most exciting explanation. Those people would like to think it's little green men, I think that's very unlikely.""  According to published reports this is not the first time a UFO has grabbed the attention of Hawaii residents.

In December of 2004 an unexplained streak of light was captured by a camera on Haleakala moving southwest to northeast. No official explanation has been given for that UFO either.

I witnessed a huge aerial event over Washington, D.C., while attending the Jan. 27 Anti- War Rally and March. A fireball streaking high overhead from south to north, it was a DAYTIME SIGHTING, the persistent long tail was bright color of electric- arc blue mixed with violet- the color and brightness appearing like lightning from this witness' perspective, the head of the object grew larger as it moved from my right to left high in the sky, directly over the U.S. Capitol and behind the speaker's stage- I was located in the Mall between the Capitol and the Washington Monument, facing east, standing almost directly in front of the speakers stage about 100 feet back when I saw this object streak overhead  about half- way through the scheduled speakers presentations. I was awed and blown away for quite a while, and I wondered whether anybody else in the crowd witnessed this !  I was initially frightened by the streak or dart of light I saw in the sky over Capitol Hill- I thought at first a big firework, then I saw how high up it was- thousands of feet, or several miles- and then I thought missile, and the fireball got somewhat larger as it traveled, -and I actually expected an explosion with sound- but only silence happened, and the tail faded without leaving any smoke or cloud whatsoever. The tail of a normal meteor would have left a thin remnant smoke or cloud trail like a contrail- but I repeatedly sought for a wisp of smoke to try to understand what I was seeing- and saw only CLEAR BLUE SKY AND SUN- BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ! AND my early impression is this was LIKE AN ARROW ! Why ? Because the tail was very long and persisted way too long to be a normal meteor. You see, a normal meteor is colored incandescent white or bright sun- yellow, with a short tail because the tail tracks closely to the head of the meteor ( look at videos of the unfortunate shuttle reentry loss ). But THIS object- the tail continued for at least 20 degrees of sky, the entire display faded all at once, and the color of the tail was electric- arc blue- like an arc welder, but deeper blue- fringed with violet- FULL LENGTH- and I think the head of the object, as it progressed and grew bigger, was more violet than blue.

Submitted by a friend on behalf of ((initials deleted)).

UFO sighting aboard USS Albany GC10, United States Ship, Guided Missile Cruiser 10, commissioned in August 1963.

Date of Incident: 1965.  Estimated late summer to early fall, it wasn?t cold.  Weather decks were open (nice weather, calm water).

Location:  East of the Azores  

((initials deleted--witness)) was an Electronic Technician ET3R (Radar).  BR did maintenance on all radar on the Albany including SPS30, SPS43, SPS39, SPS10, TACAN, and airborne early warning (AEW).  The Albany is a heavy cruiser, not an air craft carrier, but it do air traffic control (hence the TACAN).

 It was after dark, after 10:00pm ""lights out.""  Not sure if it was 8pm to Midnight or Midnight to 4am watch.

Russian Bear aircraft had recently been seen in the area and the 6th fleet was on lookout for maneuvers involving Russian aircraft and trawlers (electronic spy boats disguised as fishing boats).

((initials deleted--witness)) and air traffic controllers were watching 3 bogies on radar, but had no visual contact.  Bogies did not respond to any communication.  They were following fleet at distance of 40-50 miles for over an hour at approximately the speed of the fleet.

Decision was made to scramble three jets, possibly F4 phantoms (BR is not sure).  Jet pilots radioed back jet speed on the order of 1350 KTS.  Jet pilots did not get visual on bogies.  ((initials deleted)) could see bogies on SPS30 in height finding radar.

It was not normal to have air traffic controllers in CIC (Combat Information Center) at night.  They were officers and would normally be asleep, but controllers did arrive due to unusual occurrence this night.

The Albany used SPA33 Plan Position Indicator display units for multiple radar systems on the Albany but this system did not link into other ships in the fleet.  The important point being that a malfunction of the Albany?s radar system would not affect other ships.

The task force mission was to protect the air craft carrier.  They were protecting from sub attacks.

((initials deleted--witness)) does not remember the aircraft carrier name.

The aircraft carrier also reported three bogies on their independent on-board radar.

Albany?s radars were set on sector scan to focus on bogies.

The jets reported over the radio that they had radar contact with bogies.

Jets never got closer than 20 miles (thus no visual?).

Jets move about 1/4 inch per radar sweep at 1350 knots.  The bogies began to move away in approximately 3/4 inch jumps per sweep.  Bogies maintained triangular formation.  Bogies disappeared from radar within 7 sweeps. Jets were still visible on radar.

Officer of the watch was present talking the Albany?s air traffic controllers.

Jets still in flight broke off pursuit and turned back to the air craft carrier.

Radar went back to full 360 scan.  Radar operators were to keep a lookout for similar aircraft/bogies.

The two air controllers (lieutenant two bars) smiled at each other and one turned to BR and said, ""this incident never happened.""

((initials deleted--witness)) suspects the air controllers were acting under an order not to discuss the incident but was never personally ordered not to discuss the incident.

My husband and I were returning home one evening, the moon was full but it was only a blurred light behind a low(?), thin cloud cover.   

We were walking to the front door when I saw a small, round, whitish light in the sky approaching from the west at a high rate of speed.  It was impossible to tell the relative size of the object or its altitude.  

At first I thought there must have been a test from Lom Poc as they did launch many test missiles from this location throughout the time I lived in the west valley and they often caused some very strange displays in the sky.  But as this ""light"" approached our position leaving no contrails, it suddenly made a 90 degree turn, shot straight up through the clouds and rapidly ascended out of view.   The cloud cover parted in its wake in a perfect circle which continued to expand like a smoke ring.  

I wasn?t quite sure if I had actually seen what I saw.  My mouth dropped open and I turned to my husband as we both spoke at the exact same instant:  ""Did you see that?""   Neither of us could explain what we had just witnessed.

I?ve told this story to a few people over the years when the subject of UFO?s would come up in casual conversation and to this day it gives me chills yet I can tell my listeners want to dismiss my story as just that; a story.  The overactive imaginings of youth.  I have never claimed the object was extraterrestrial; however I always do remind them that UFO only means the object was unidentified and flying.  

I am still a practicing skeptic, but I just don?t have any rational explanation for what we saw that evening and as of yet no one else has either.

Traveling cross country from Houston TX, to San Diego, CA, I slept in El Paso Texas, then headed west on Route 10.   About 25 or 30 miles into Arizona, I stopped to stretch my legs in the desert.  The weather was exceptionally clear, stars were almost on the horizon and there was a full moon.  One maybe two cars passed in the roughly 15 minutes I was there.

 Looking South to Southeast, I saw an array of lights just over my right shoulder, close to Zenith, slightly to the West. I listened for a sound but there was none. I first thought it might be a helicopter. Its overall shape was indeterminate except for the elliptical/oval array of lights which were sharp and distinct. There were two (2) colors of lights, evenly spaced, alternating blush red, and a sort of mercury blue. For a minute or so it was motionless, perfectly stable as I tried to make out an overall shape, determine what it was and it?s altitude. Not knowing its altitude or size I couldn?t estimate either. I guessed that the elliptical shape of lights could be circular depending on its aspect or tilt.

 It then moved purposefully but slightly to the North, then back just a little toward the South, and stopped. From a full stop it then instantly accelerated over the Eastern horizon in what I estimated to be about 4-5 Seconds. Its path was perfectly straight without any random motion or bobbling. I stood and waited for about a minute believing I?d hear a sonic boom but there was no sound, sonic boom or otherwise. A diffuse blue contrail was left in its flight path, perfectly illuminated by the moon. This gradually turned to very thin white puffs and disappeared. No other aircraft were in the area.

 I thought about what I?d seen.  Thinking the Eastern mountain ranges were maybe 5K to 8K feet in altitude, it seemed to clear them by about 5K feet (estimate) so I assumed the craft was maybe at 12K-15K feet altitude. My confusion was how a craft or a missile could go from a full stop to 3 or 4 miles per second without any sound.

 I?m not exactly an untrained observer.  For 10 years I worked on the development and launch of more than 20 rocket-borne and reconnaissance aircraft systems.  After that I worked on Apollo instrumentation systems and was at the Flight Control Operations Directorate at the Johnson Space Center in Houston during Apollo 15, 16 & 17, and Skylab I, II, and III.

I had just finished the main leg of my run and was walking back to my apartment when I ran into a buddy of mine.  We were chatting for about 5 minutes right in front of my apartment when an incredibly bright, white ball of light suddenly appeared about 100 feet (rough approximation) in the air, seemingly out of nowhere. It looked like a perfectly round sphere, of a pure white light (a white like none I have ever seen before), and had a white tail of light that tapered of at the end.  

It was traveling in a north-western direction, was totally silent, and quickly disappeared.  It only lasted about 5 seconds but I saw it clearly as I was facing its direction.  My friend only saw it out of the corner of his eye. 

We went walking in the direction that it was headed, since it looked like it was going to crash into the ground, to see if we could find anything.  However we didn?t see much nor did we run into anyone else who we could ask if they had also seen it.  We only walked about a block though.  My first impression was a missile (due to the fact that we have frequent military aircraft flybys) or a firework.  But it couldn?t have been either because of the nature of its appearance.  I don?t know what it was but I am thoroughly excited by the sighting.

Since it was requested, I am a skeptical individual but have a desire to believe. I can?t claim that it was a UFO since I know very little about the nature of sightings and what-not.  As a kid, though, I was obsessed with them.

I was southbound on Highway 101 near Minetta San Jose Airport when I saw a very bright, cobalt blue light in the sky.  At first I thought it was a missile (I?ve never seen a missile) and that it was headed for the airport.  

I was afraid, and so pulled the car over to the side of the road.  The bright light suddenly leveled out, stopped and made a sharp turn to the left and disappeared.

I was driving home from the Los Verdes Golf Course on the Palos Verdes Peninsula during the summer of 1986. Truthfully, it has been so long that I may be off by a year or so on the date, but it was the middle of summer. LVGC is on the west side of the peninsula, near the top of the hill above the Pacific Ocean. The time was about 5 pm or 6 pm and the sky was clear and sunny.

 As I began to drive down the hill towards the ocean on Hawthorne Blvd, I noticed a strange flying object, near the cliffs on the water. It was moving slowly, no more than 20-40 mph. The position of the object was south of the Point Vicente lighthouse by about a mile or two. The object was very angular, oblong and shaped oddly which is why I believe that I noticed it at all. We were used to seeing small planes, helicopters and the Goodyear Blimp flying around the peninsula.  The thing I witnessed was not any of those. It did not appear as if it should be able to fly. No wings, no rotors, no jet engines (it was not disc shaped either). As I drove down the hill, I had a pretty good look at it, but it was probably about a mile or two away (as a crow flies). I have attempted to sketch what I saw in the ""1-2 miles away"" drawing. This first half of my sighting lasted about 15-20 seconds. Then as I was driving down the hill I lost sight of the object behind fences and houses.

 Once at the bottom of the hill, I pulled my car into the Safeway parking lot and got out. I had a really good look at the thing for about another 10-15 seconds as it flew between some hills. My second sketch depicts a side view of the craft. Again, this view showed the angular construction of the object but this time it was closer. The color was dull gray. I could clearly see rectangular, opaque panels on the side of the craft. A notched cutout was visible on the bottom near the front. No lights at all were visible but again it was still very light outside. It was moving slowly at low altitude, no more than 500 ft up.

 I have never submitted a report of this incident. Back when it happened, I absolutely expected that I would soon be reading about it in the newspapers. Nothing was ever reported that made the news, at least not that I saw. I am still amazed that a bunch of people did not see and report this flying object. The only thing peculiar that I can think of regarding the location of the object was that it was near the old NIKE missile site up on the hill. This NIKE site was converted and now houses city government offices. During the twenty odd years that have passed since I saw this thing, I have never seen a picture of a UFO on TV or otherwise that looks like what I saw that day.

I witnessed for the first time the most unbelievable thing that proves something I didn't believe in before I witnessed it occur. The United States Government scrambled jets to intercept groups of alien craft all day long as I sat and watched it from my living room window. I am in such disbelief, because like I said I was not a firm believer in life outside of our own planetary system. It is the truth, the craft I saw moved so quick, made no noise, but our craft being F-15 fighters I believe or something similar in nature, we able to use their weapons systems, perhaps modified systems, and shot them down...catching flame and landing in the mountain range of the Rocky Mountains. The craft, all 9 of them, fell from the sky when our weapons hit them, which indicated to me that in fact they were destroyed. Right now I am certain that because it did not make the news, that there is a top secret cover up, naturally the government wanting to keep this under wraps and I can understand the reasoning. The craft kept appearing, making me believe that we were not being successful in hitting them with our weapons systems. I saw trails, indicating something was fired from our craft towards theirs. Then I saw two craft together, indicating to me that in fact we were destroying their craft afterall, since they struck both craft together and they fell to the ground at a fast pace. The total number of planes of our aircraft varied throughout the day as they scrambled to attack them, but they arrived quickly and to my surprise given that our craft appear to be such lower in technology than theirs...but to my surprise again, simple systems of weaponry brought down what must have been intruders in our airspace and caught or detected by Space Command or Norad, or some other top secret detection facility...I'm convinced that we must have such things now that I am convinced that we've had bad visitors from outerspace. Their craft were triangular in shape, could move in any direction in an instant, but for some ! reason t hey weren't able to duck and weave whatever weapon it was that the United States Air Force was firing upon them, which was something unconventional you could tell by their streams that they left in the air...very different looking, almost as if to trace the location of the missiles from start to finish. I believe, knowing weapons systems very well from the Reagan era that are in use today, despite treaties, that satellites lit up the craft from the sky up high, and the missiles were guided directly to their targets without fail. I did see one alien craft seem to disappear in an instant, or it traveled from its location in an instant. All 9 craft that I saw were hit and fell to the ground behind some mountains. All scrambling jets ceased to fly once they were shot down, but it's not reported in the media and I haven't heard of anyone else seeing what I saw. So I do know it's being covered up in large scale. This is not the first sighting I've had with triangular craft. A group of about 7 or so flew directly over my condo one night, had zero noise in propulsion, flew very slow, and were lit up from beneath for all to witness, didn't seem to be afraid of showing themselves off. This event was in Lakewood, CO at the time probably 2 years ago.

I think what I saw was a missile launch, but if that is indeed what I saw, then this is the first time I have ever seen the actual missile flying through the air. I first saw a vertical wavy smoke trail above the mountains to the Southeast of Tucson, and at the top of the trail, I saw a cigar shaped object flying upwards. The smoke dissipated, and the object leveled off and flew a straight horizontal path parallel to the mountains, and probably somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 feet. I was stopped at a red light in my car when I saw this and I was able to follow the tiny distant object for about a minute before I had to concentrate more on the road in front of me.

April 16th, 2007, Brentwood, CA (East SF Bay Area)  Witness: 21 year old female  9:05 P.M.

Lying in bed, I saw out my northeast-facing window what I first thought to be the reflection of a car headlight moving across the glass. It took me only a second to realize that the size, shape and movement of the light was all wrong and definitely not a reflection.  I got out of bed and was astonished to see a ball of orange light, emanating a sort of fiery glow.  I cannot stress enough the image of fire in this situation.  

My first thought was that it was an airplane on fire in the distance or a flare, but it wasn?t falling and there was no smoke. Instead it moved from west to northeast in a very controlled motion.  When I determined that it was going slow enough that I would be able to alert my father and mother before it disappeared, I ran from the room.  

Soon 4 of us were gathered on the front porch watching it move further away, getting smaller until it was only a pinprick of light and then gone. The weather was immaculate: clear skies and a very minimal amount of wind. The object made no sound and was visible to us for about 4-5 minutes. We debated who to call and finally decided to go to bed without doing anything.

9:15 P.M.

I had just reentered my room and was in front of the window, opening my curtains a little more ""just in case"" when an even bigger ""orb"" came into sight from over my neighbors roof (the same direction as the first object.)  

As far as size goes, it started out a little bit bigger than an aspirin held at arms length, gradually getting smaller as it moved further away.  I yelled for my family again and 4 of us ran out onto the porch once more.  My father snapped two pictures with a 35 mm (the film of which hasn?t been developed yet.) 

This object did the exact same thing as the first - slowly fade into the northeastern sky - but seemed to move a tiny bit quicker, lasting around 3-4 minutes before it disappeared from sight. Our neighbors were outside and we cried, ""Are you seeing this?!"" They said it was like nothing they?d ever seen before. Back inside we called the National UFO Center in Davenport, WA and I spoke to a man and answered questions about what I had seen. He told me it was not a meteor and there were no scheduled missile launches in our area.

 9:45 P.M.

We were sitting down to write our own personal accounts when my youngest sister called out, ""It?s back!"" My entire family, this time including my other sister (making a total of 5 of us) stood on the porch staring in disbelief at the third ""orb.""   It behaved in an identical fashion as the first two.  Though the three did disappear in the same region of sky, they not disappear in identical places.

Witness: 54 year old male   Approx. 9:05 P.M.  my daughter called me to come and look at a strange, glowing object in the sky.  I was in my bedroom upstairs and walked out of my room. There?s a window that looks out to the N.E. I saw an orange, glowing light moving slowly in the eastern sky.  It was clear night, no clouds. It appeared to be moving slowly away, getting smaller, but the light appeared to be pulsing and becoming dimmer. Not sure if it was because of distance as it moved away or was dimming.  We watched it for another few minutes.  I called my wife to come and see it. She saw it for a minute or so before it disappeared from view.

We were all excited and mystified. It did not appear to be a plane and made no sound that we could hear. We talked about reporting it but decided we felt silly. I started to go back to bed. After another couple of minutes my daughter called out that she sees another one! I bolted out of my room in disbelief and witnessed another glowing object at 9:15 in the same location. I ran downstairs to run outside for a better unobstructed view. It seemed larger and very bright orange. It almost appeared to be on fire, like shimmering rising from a slow-moving, floating orb. I could not make out any details - only orange-red glowing as it moved from west to east. My daughter came up behind me from inside and handed me her 35 mm camera. I snapped 2 photos. We then called the Nat?l UFO Center in Davenport, WA. My daughter reported the incident to them on the phone.

 Amazingly, my youngest daughter, who was able to see the 2nd orb was looking into the eastern sky and and yelled out that she sees another one! We thought she was joking, but we ran to the front door anyway and witnessed a 3rd identical object traveling in the same direction. We were somewhat alarmed by it by now. My neighbor was outside standing on his driveway, talking to a friend. I called over and said, ""C--, do you see that? What is it?"" 

He said he had never seen anything like it. We watched it disappear in the same direction after several minutes.

Witness: 13 year old female  On April 16, 2007, I saw an orange fiery ball in the sky that I thought was a UFO. It started at about 9:05 and they were about 5 minutes long in the sky. My other 4 family members saw them in the sky. When I saw the second one it scared me and it looked like a ball of fire traveling northeast in the clear night sky. That one started at about 9:15. When I spotted the third one through my living room window, it was a little smaller than a full moon. When it traveled across the sky, it went left to right and then stopped. When it stopped it started to fade away. That was about 9:45 to 9:50 or 9:55. My dad got two shots of it with his camera.

I was delivering newspapers at approximately 3:30 AM, October 1, 1961, (plus of minus a week), on North Braden Avenue at the corner of East Marshal Street.  It was cold (30-35F) and the sky was clear of clouds.

Two circular, saucer-shaped objects flew over me in a North-East direction, generally headed toward the Tulsa airport approximately two and a half miles away.  My estimate at the time was that they were flying at about 250 feet altitude, and were about 80 feet across.  It was relatively easy to judge the distance, as the edges of the saucers were crisply in focus.  There was very faint scoring or scratching on the bottom surface of the saucers, giving a slight textured appearance, which also allowed me to judge altitude better.  They flew at approximately 15-20 MPH (very slowly), and in line (one behind the other, same altitude).  The bottom of the saucers glowed with a golden light that pulsed slowly, in about a 2-3 second cycle from dimmer to lighter and back to dimmer.  The pulsing was very distinct, but not the cycle was not ""wide,"" in that it was never particularly bright, and always a bit dim.  The saucers were completely silent.  There were no ""point"" lights, or particular light emitting locations except for the whole of the under surface.

The location was very slightly hilly, and the saucers proceeded in a direction directly in line with the street.  I would watch clearly them until they had flown about a mile and a half away.  As they receded, it became apparent that the main bodies of the saucers had the appearance of two thin spherical surfaces, one above and one below, meeting at the edges.  Given the estimate that the saucers were 80 feet in diameter, I estimate that the main body of the saucers were 8 feet thick.

The main body of each saucer was surmounted by a translucent (opaque) white dome, rising approximately 4 feet above the main body.  The dome was only a little brighter than the golden bottoms.  There were no ""point"" sources of light on the dome.  I do not recall that the top surface of the saucers, apart from the domes, glowed; however, it is likely that they did glow only a little dimmer than the bottoms or I would have noticed either that they were dark or that the saucer bodies were uniformly bright, top and bottom.  I do not recall that the dome lighting pulsed.

It is possible that my size estimates are too small.  It is possible that the saucers were instead, 125 feet across and 12 feet thick in the main body with a 6-7 foot dome, flying up to but not exceeding 400 feet in altitude.  These sizes are an upper limit and unlikely.

At the time I was skilled in aircraft recognition, having been growing up with a parent who was employed at the Tulsa Airport and who kept me well informed about airplanes and air flight mechanics.  I was also a relatively skilled hunter, with a good sense of distance for estimating bullet trajectories for high powered rifles.

Naturally, I thought this to be an extraordinary incident, and so I kept my eyes on the sky for many mornings thereafter.  Subsequently, within two or three weeks I saw another saucer, which I will report here as part of the same incident.

I was standing at the corner of East Pine and North Yale, approximately half a mile North of the previous sighting, and saw a saucer fly overhead in a South-West direction toward downtown Tulsa, 4 miles away.  The location was elevated sufficiently so that I could see the downtown skyline.  The saucer was the same size and shape, but this time flying silently at 750-1000 feet altitude at perhaps 200-250 MPH.  It glowed with a golden pulsing light, as had the two saucers in the previous sighting.

Within perhaps 1 to 1-1/2 minutes, the saucer passed just even with or to the other side of the downtown region and turned Northward at probably the same speed.  From this distance it was a little easier to estimate the altitude, as the profile of the saucer was relatively clear, although distant and therefore a small visual object.  The saucer flew Northward for about a mile, until more or less directly East of me, then abruptly changed both direction and speed.  The saucer abruptly veered upward at about 25 degrees -- a ""point-turn"" with no curvature to it that I could detect from where I was.  It abruptly increased in speed to what I would estimate to be about 1500 MPH.  I judge this to be the speed from the prior assessment that it was going 250 MPH, and was not going 6-8 times that speed, upward at the 25 degree angle.  It seemed that the saucer accelerated from 250 to 1500 in not more than a few hundred feet, if it took even that distance.  For all I knew, it was instantaneous, since one or two saucer-body lengths in acceleration to that speed would have been indistinguishable from instantaneous.  The saucer continued upward rapidly until I could no longer see it.

Within one week more, I saw something that I presumed to be a saucer, also.  From the same location at Pine and Yale, I looked into the sky Southward and a little East, and saw high into the sky (about 55-60 degrees elevation) what appeared to be a meteor entering the atmosphere -- a not uncommon sight.  However, this meteor began to glow, then streaked down at about 150-160 degrees downward Upper Left to Lower Right in my vision, then abruptly slowed and stopped in place, still glowing brightly from what I thought to be heated entry into the atmosphere.  After remaining completely still for approximately 10 seconds, it flew off horizontally to the horizon, Eastward (probably South-East from its stopped position) and disappeared into the distance.  I could not see features on this object, nor its shape.  The event was probably 8-10 miles distant, perhaps in an area 1-3 miles West of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.

These three events were the only ones I saw.

We reached the Orchidland Drive intersection and all the power went out, street lights, homes, etc. Then the lights came back on, we were still driving as we observed this and reached the turn off at Paradise Drive in Hawaiian Paradise Park when the transformer blew to our upper right and we saw sparks fall to the ground. At that same moment I looked toward the ocean, looking East and witnessed an enormous bright illuminating green flash which scared my brother and I and we continued to drive down Paradise drive toward the ocean and saw 2 more green flashes that illuminated the sky.

All of the power was out down Paradise Drive and the cable was out too. We still have no idea what the green flashes were that lit up with sky and why it was simultaneous with the power outage and transformer blowing up. What chemicals burn green? I'm not a scientist but I figured if the 3 flashes were other transformers then why did the one at the highway spark in white and orange color? I know there were other witnesses, the brightness of the night sky was so lit up by the green illuminating flash I would be surprised if it didn't make our local news in the next few days. We also thought it could have been some sort of craft that crashed into the ocean and when it was flying over the neighborhood it's magnetic field disrupted our electricity. Friends and m! yself ha d reported earlier in the daytime the tv acting funny and popping and cracking sounds coming from the sky.

	My friends and I, were hanging out in one of the friend's yard talking and trying to find satelites and such.  I was looking up and I swore I saw (what I thought was a typically star), moving left and right just enough to notice it. It wasn't flashing like stars do, it was solid.  And as far as I knew only planets did that.  So I thought it was a planet, but something seemed to make me second guess it.  I leveled my hand with it vertically to a nearby star.  The object went in and out of view from behind my hand.  I started to ask them (my friends) if they saw it as well, and one of my friends said and I'm quoting ""Do you see that star?  It's F***ing moving man!"".

	We continued watching it go back and forth for several minutes.  I saw a ""satelite"" and pointed it out.  It was going in the direction of the object, off at 30 degree or so.  It continued until it passed the object on the left side.  It started to go around in a large circle until it was on level with the object, and TURNED  45 degrees heading directly at it.

	We were all watching it with anticipation of what was happening and freaked out.  What happened next is what got us.  It hit on the right side and a flash or spark went shotting out the left side at about 3 times the speed.  When it hit we all said some exclamations.  Both objects were gone.  Since that day I've always believed that extraterrestials have been here for the blip of an existence we've had.  And I'm pretty sure my friends are the same way.

Driving home from work on my motorcycle, I noticed a bird with its wings tucked in that seemed to be using a warm updraft to keep itself floating in a semi-stationary position. I looked back at the road and looked up again thinking that I had never seen a bird able to keep afloat for that amount of time without utilizing its wings. As I stared longer I realized it was not a bird at all. In fact it was something that I could not explain. I seem to want to compare it to a submarine that was flying. Or maybe a missile, due to its shape. It was black and long and thin, similar to a cigar. It seemed to have small fins sticking out of its sides. Again I was on my motorcycle and so I could not here any sounds, nor did I see any lights. Its movement was not that of a rocket, because it did not move in a linear manner. I would liken its movement to someone holding it on a string and pulling it up and down, and if it weren?t for the height of the object in the sky, roughly 500 feet, and location, over a heavily wooded area, I would swear someone was holding it up on a fishing line. It slowly moved north and soon was out of my view. I am a former airman in the U.S Air Force and have seen lots of crazy flying machines, but this was like nothing I have ever seen before.

Sighting of ten starlike points of light objects in daytime sky just sse of overhead Ralston, Nebraska (suburb town on southwest side of Omaha).  Sighting lasted about 10 minutes beginning at about 8pm CDT on Thursday, 5 July 2007.

I was sitting in a lawn chair outdoors at a swing and big band concert offered by the city in downtown Ralston facing south.  The crowd was of about 75 was mainly made up of people in their 50s to 70s years of age and some in front of me began pointing up to the daytime cloudless sky, and I looked up to at first see five bright silver starlike points of light in the sky stationary and in a zigzag like pattern.  Within minutes I counted 7 and then I counted 9 and then 10 in all stationary across the sky of various intensities and all silver in color except one fainter one which had a reddish tint.  None blinked or pulsated but looked more like how Venus currently looks in the western sky vs a twinkling star affect.

Since the sun was low on the horizon, the brightness appeared to be reflection.  Knowing how bright the International Space Station can be after sunset when its orbit is just right and how bright satellites can be in the early evening, these objects could have been at a very high altitude and hence could have been seen across a widespread area and hopefully others have seen something similar.

The lights were not evenly spread out but some were alone and some were in somewhat close groups of two or three in no particular pattern.  After about 5 minutes, three of the lights moved in all different directions and the group farthest to the southeast made a  tight triangle around the reddish light.  After a few more minutes, in this same area, four lights moved close to one another to form a rough letter C.

About ten minutes after first seeing this strange event, a high flying aircraft flew across the sky from east to west and when it did, coincidentally all but one of the lights vanished and by the time the airplane crossed that area to the west, the last light was gone as well.

I did not have nor did I see anyone there with a camera or video equipment to record this event.

I saw no more starlike items in the sky until after sunset an hour and a half later when Venus was visible and by 9:45 several of the brighter stars came out as normal.

I am familiar with planes and satellites and what I saw was not those.  I am familiar with the brightness of white-breasted geece flying and how the sun can reflect off them and what they look like and what I saw was not birds.  I have always been interested in astronomy and earth sciences and am a meteorologist by profession.  I have never seen an object in the sky I could not reasonably identify until late Thursday the 5th.   I made a report to the Omaha World Herald news tip line an hour after the event and they said no one had called about the lights but they would check with the Ralston Police Dept (I had not notified them, just the newspaper).

I came across your website today with the phone number and called.  No one at work on Friday when I posted an e-mail on the bulletin board responded as having seen it and I took a good bit of ribbing about it.

Viewing UFO panel discussion on Larry King Live July 13, 2007, compelled me to make this report some 39 years after the fact.

 In August 1968 while working at Boy Scout Camp Benjamin Hawkins, Byron, GA, two fellow scouts and I spotted a craft in the night sky.  The craft produced a sound much like a very high-speed electrical motor, shrill and almost inaudible.  Its shape was that of two bright silver/white saucers placed face to face with a row of clear lights around the center much akin to windows in a commercial jet.  The lights seemed to revolve very rapidly like a gyroscope.

 The craft hovered approximately 300? directly above our heads and seemed to place us in an electrical field, because for a brief time we could not move our bodies.  After a few minutes the craft began to move very slowly to the southwest toward a Niaki Missile base which bordered the camp property.  Just as it reached the tree line it banked slightly and disappeared in a split second, never to be seen again.

 The Niaki Missile base located in Byron, GA is just a short distance from Robins Air Force Base, Warner Robins, Georgia.

This past Labor day weekend my daughter and her family came to visit me at my home on Whidbey island, north of Seattle Washington. We were roasting marshmallows with the grandkids on the beach one night, and the subject of UFO's came up.  My daughter re-capped an incident that I had long since forgotten about, mostly because at that time I was skeptical and didn?t have time to think of such things as UFO's. 

This happened about 19 years ago, but I think is worth passing on.  It involved my daughter (16 at the time) and her mother, the location was near Monroe Washington.  

Quote:  ""Mom picked me up at the Dairy Queen, where I was working part time during the summer months before school started. It was dusk at the time, we drove up the woods creek road towards home.  As we drove along we saw a bright light ahead and as we neared it and saw what a strange thing we were looking at, Mom pulled our car to a stop, lowered the windows and shut the motor off. We gazed in amazement at what we saw, it was a football shaped craft with several lights from front to back. It was hovering over a dairy farm field, perhaps a hundred feet off the ground, I would guess it was about 30 feet in length. It made no sound at all, we had our windows down and our motor was shut off. After just a few minutes it started moving slowly up the valley (north). Mom started the car and we stayed along with it for about a mile, it then turned to the left (west), increased in speed and shot out of sight like a bullet."" End of quote.. 

My daughter is and has always been a responsible person, you can take what she says to the bank.  

I myself filed a report a few years back on strange lights observed by my hunting partners and I near Coulee Dam Wa.

I was sat in my back garden on the evening of 10th September 2007 at approx 22:30 with my wife. I was looking up at the sky and noticed a series of lights which living on a flight path thought it was a jet at high altitude.

 Upon further viewing I noticed that there was more than 1 light (8 or maybe 10) in a straight line formation going across the sky from East to West. The line was a series of dots (a bit like tracer bullets being fired). These were in a perfect straight line but for a moment the back 3 or 4 fish tailed up then went back into formation. They travelled faster than a jet and were uniformly spaced out. This is a legitimate sighting but I have no other proof. I asked my wife had she seen it but she put it down to a plane. I just needed to tell someone about this.

At around 10:30 yesterday evening I observed odd lights low in the sky west of Chillicothe Ohio.  I first noticed a slowly flashing while light, dimmer than the surrounding stars.  The flash was at a much slower pace than a typical aircraft warning light, perhaps three seconds between flashes.  After a few minutes, two more of these slow flashers appeared.  The sky was clear, so it shouldn't be assumed that they arrived under cloud cover.

They began to move south at a slow rate of speed.  Suddenly, the top-most light emitted a bright red 'projectile' of some sort that sped out in front of it, growing dimmer as it went until is seemed to extinguish.  The other two light began to emit these projectiles, one every 20 seconds or so.

After roughly 15 minutes, the lights simply went out, not far from where the event began.  I waited for another 15 minutes, but the lights did not return.  I've witnessed similar lights on two occasions in the past two weeks.  The events last no longer than 15 minutes and I've yet to see the lights entering or exiting the area where the lights are firing the red projectiles.

Could someone contact Wright Patterson AFB to see if this might be a training exercise?  I couldn't find a number for them that would allow me to speak to someone who could clarify.  The red lights traveled in a straight path out from the lights, so it didn't seem like any flares that I've seen before.

My friend and I witnessed a bright light in the sky on Monday September 17, 2007 at approximately 7:30-7:45 pm.  We did not check our watch, but Venus was very visible and few other stars were showing.

The light was about equal in brightness to Venus and did not appear to be moving. There was no visible trail, and we thought it was another bright planet.  It was approximately 45 degrees off of the horizon.  After observing the light for approximately 15 seconds, the light vanished and a white haze lingered in its location for less than a minute.

The location of the light was almost due north, as I noted the direction and compared it to the presence of the North Star and big dipper once they appeared.  We were located on a boat at the Channel Islands in Southern California.  Specifically, we were anchored at smugglers cove on the east end of Santa Cruz Island, and the light appeared above Santa Barbara.

My first thoughts were that it may be a satellite, but I have never seen a satellite that was that bright.  The white haze had me thinking that it was a missile or rocket launch from Vandenberg AFB, but my research so far shows no launches that evening.  I have seen missile launches before and have seen a haze after the rocket left the atmosphere, but this did not appear to be moving and there was no contrail.","business owner",2,1,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2007,2000,3,9,17,"Afternoon","West",0,1,0,1,0

My husband, my brother, my sister-in-law and I were vacationing at a coastal house in Bodega Bay, CA (about two hours north of San Francisco).  We were watching the sun set over the ocean and preparing to watch the clear night sky, so we had big binoculars (16X70) set up on a tripod on the west-facing patio.  Moments after sunset (which occurred at 7:15 p.m., [see photo]), while the sky at the horizon was still orangey, we noticed a very bright orange/gold streak moving at a slightly upward angle in a north-to-south direction [see photos].  At arm?s length and measuring between thumb and forefinger, the streak early on was about an inch above the horizon.  We then looked at it through the binoculars and we saw not only the streak, but a dark, somewhat elongated object that was rounded at the leading edge of what we then called a ?trail?. The object took up about 1/4 inch of the streak.  Over the next minute or so, the trail got to be about four inches long (as measured above).

 A minute or two after we first saw the trail, the object/trail appeared to stop and hover in place for another 10 minutes or so, but the trail did not dissipate at all like a vapor trail would.  (Since we were facing west, it's also possible the object was not hovering but rather moving west to east or east to west after it appeared to stop.) We could see the trail and the ""unmoving"" object for a total of 10 minutes or so until it got too dark to see through the binoculars.  The pictures we took do not even begin to show the brightness of the trail.

 Based on the ""distance to horizon"" calculator on the Internet, we estimated the distance to the object was about 15.5 nautical or 17.9 statute miles.  (We did a Google Earth calculation that showed our rental house was 172 feet above sea level and, adding the five-foot height of the tripod, resulted in a ""height of eye"" of 177 feet.)  If the object was almost 18 miles away, the object would have to be quite large to appear as big as it did, even though it required binoculars to see it.

Our collective conclusion was that the object was too big to be any kind of airplane and that the trail was not a vapor trail.  The way the object appeared to stop and hover, and the fact that the trail did not dissipate, were also very strange.  Maybe it was some kind of missile, but we sure can?t figure it out.

I am estimating the date and time of this event due to the amount of time that has passed. I do remember that it was shortly after I graduated high school (1980), and had landed a job at the local mall as a maintenance employee. 

I remember leaving work and proceeding north through south Aberdeen, and had to stop at a red light before proceeding over the Chehalis river bridge. To my surprise, a long convoy of military vehicles was headed south over the bridge, pulling trailers, some covered with tarp, others obviously diesel generators, along with one truck pulling a piece of heavy equipment (bulldozer). I just thought there were military exercises taking place somewhere and thought nothing more about it. 

Later that day, I heard local radio, reporting that a cylindrical shaped object was seen over interstate 5 near or at Olympia WA, and that the craft was headed West. This craft was witnessed by hundreds if not thousands of people already. 

The craft was now reported by eye witness accounts to have been following State Route 12 West towards the coast. The craft was witnessed flying low, not very fast, and was on fire, but emitted no smoke and made no noise The craft was under some sort of control, as witnesses reported that it followed the highway, making turns to correct course.  It had flown over sparsely populated areas, and was later seen flying ""along highway 12"", through the vicinity of Central Park, a outlying area East of Aberdeen, and again witnessed by hundreds, (motorists and residents of Central Park). 

Before the craft entered the city of Aberdeen itself, it took a fairly large turn to the left, flying over Junction City, across the town of Cosmopolis, and was now headed South West towards Westport WA.  Witnesses reported the craft to have followed the Westport highway to the point of the Elk River bridge where it turned abruptly to the left, flying directly over the bridge and followed the Elk River South East where one witness reported it crashing with a white flash on the visi! ble hori zon.  The area of the crash is forest land accessible only by logging roads.  

No explanation was given as to what it was by any Government agency.  Residents in the vicinity of the crash site reported that the military cordoned off the area and installed road blocks into the area denying any entry. Reports by residents, (rumors) that some of the teenage boys took dirt bikes out and rode as close as they could,?after already trying the roads and having been sent away by armed soldiers?, and hiking through the timber, where they reported seeing tree tops broke. They reported seeing a roughly 70 foot long cylindrical craft, lit by flood lights, with men moving about the craft in protective clothing, ?obviously what the diesel generators were used for?. About 10 years later, while working another job, I had the opportunity to speak personally with one resident who lived in the area of the site, who was a fellow co-worker of mine. He told me, ?one of those teenage boys on the dirt bikes was his?, and that many days after the event, ?government sedans had stopped at many of the residents homes to ask what they had seen, and to not continue to spread rumors?. He also said that some residents had been ?threatened to shut up or else?. This was big news for about a week in the area, but died out just like the rest. I recall my co-worker telling me that they flew the craft out, wrapped in canvas tarp towards the ocean slung under a sky crane helicopter. Weeks later, after many calls to the local authorities, the local radio reported that the government reported  that it had been a small airplane that crashed. Nothing more was ever reported, but to this day I believe what I saw (the convoy), and what the neighbors in the area saw to be true. I truly believe, if this was not a crash of a then new cruise missile, to be a craft from another place, and another Roswell, but due to the time and place, receive much less publicity. This incident happened in the evening, while I was working, my shift ending at 07:00AM, so the m! ilitary response was pretty rapid since the heavy equipment was assembled and in the area in less than 9 hours, as witnesses in Central Park were calling in reports to authorities around 22:00 hrs. Fort Lewis WA is less than 2 hrs from Aberdeen, and probably less than 3.5 hrs from the actual crash site. No other aircraft were reported in the air visually, with the stricken craft. All witnesses reported seeing flames emanating from the craft and they also reported that it made no engine noises, or any noise at all. If it was a cruise missile it would have been emitting sound.

Around 8pm we went out for a trip to Burger King.  I noticed a large number of planes hovering above the city.  They were not passenger planes, presumably fighter jets from the looks of them.  Each had a red white and blue light.  They were flying in pairs back and forth across the sky at staggered heights.

 After driving home and watching the planes (we counted approximately 10), we sat out on the roof of the car and watched.  

Around 8:30pm we saw an abject appear, and move at extremely high speed in a downward direction as though it were about to crash into the ground, but disappeared before it ever left the sky line.

 Immediately after the planes began to clear away, although a few still scanned the skylines, but much higher in the air.  In the beginning the plans were exceptionally low.

I was watching TV and, out of the corner of my view through a window, I saw a bright light. I thought VAFB was doing another launch. I went outside and observed that it was not a missile (not the usual engine rumble and the trajectory was wrong).

The aircraft was moving south at a good clip but not anything super fast, and it wasn?t rotating. I kept watching as it flew directly over my home. It was dark so I could not gage altitude, but I would guess under a thousand feet. It seemed to have a round cylindrical shape, with red and green lights. I was thinking it was an airplane-- it had to be, but with no engine noise? I saw what looked like a shooting star just to its left and thought that was a strange coincidence then, I saw another.

I tracked it until it was over the city of Lompoc then I saw it stop. A white light was coming from the top. This light had a strange look though. Instead of just a solid light it looked like it was a very fast strobing light. I was considering it might be some experimental, Air force thing. Then I saw what appeared to be an aircraft with a single white light coming from the direction of the VAFB flight line (that aircraft made a jet engine noise) and was headed toward the ""floating"" craft. 

The first craft then resumed its clip heading down the coast followed by the other craft until I lost sight of both.

I've lived on or around AFB?s for over 40 yrs and never have I witnessed anything like this, so I just wanted to tell someone.

 I have made a copy of the video for your review. My assignment was to capture footage of F4 and F-16 aircraft flying at us to test for acquiring capabilities of which I cannot go into at this time.

 The object was flying at 350 knots and reduced to around 200 knots when it go close to the bottom of the mountain I was video from.

 Note that I am estimating the speed since I had no way of measuring the speed other than the F-16 aircraft flying at us was flying at a similar speed.

 All this is verifiable by others in the test and with receipts from hotels, rentals and personnel from the White Sands Missile Range.

I quickly called my wife who is currently in Canada, and she went outside and saw the same glowing cloud.  I was able to view the object through night vision monocular and it appeared very much like a comet with a nucleus and tail aligned toward the northwest; initially the tail was nebulous, but also contained a split so that it appeared as a V.  

But this appeared to be drifting toward the east very slowly, but too fast to be a comet.  

As I was observing the cloud I saw five distinct small flashes of light toward the nucleus area;  gradually the object faded in luminosity and disappeared.

I went in and got my binoculars (12 power) and resumed watching.  With binoculars, I was able to see that the object was moving slowly, referencing the stars nearby.  

Over the course of 20 or 25 minutes, the object moved in an ENE direction from near the constellation Pegasus until it became too faint to see in the middle of the constellation Cassiopeia.

December 10, 2007 (written 2130 hrs) To whom it may concern,  I am an amateur astronomer and was observing here in my observatory at my home in Pittsboro, N.C., observing a double star in the constellation Delphinus.

At approximately 1845, I spotted a green hue in the SW skies near the Messier object M15, approximately 45 degrees above the SW horizon.  It appeared to be a comet; I quickly slewed my telescope to the object, and viewed it at a magnification of 100X. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed, but much slower than a normal satellite when viewed through a telescope eyepiece field of view.

The object contained what appeared to be a head and a tail (very much like Haley?s comet looked years ago through a pair of binoculars), and its magnitude was so bright that it was dominant in the sky.  There was also a point of light that moved with the object at the same speed, approximately one tenth of a degree from the ?head? of the object.

I tracked the object for approximately 45 minutes, the ?tail? faded (almost appeared to dissipate over time), but the point of light near the haze remained in the eyepiece, it?s magnitude and position not changing over the period of time that it was tracked. The object passed very close to the star Schedar in the constellation Cassiopeia.  I stopped tracking the object as it passed through the constellation Cassiopeia at approximately 1935 hrs. The object continued to move in a NE direction at approximately 60 degrees above the northern horizon.

The Telescope I was using to track the ?object? was a Telescope Engineering Company (TEC) 200mm (8 inch) f/9 refractor, mounted on a Astro-Physics 1200gto computerized equatorial mount. The object was tracked by moving the Declination and Right ascension axis in a manual mode.

Total observation time: Approx. 1 hour, from 19:30 to 20:30 EST.

 Object description:  To the naked eye, appeared as a gray hazy patch, mostly circular but flattened on one side. Approximate magnitude 1 to 2 at initial sighting, approximate size ? degree across.

 Through binoculars (10x50) & telescope (6? F5 reflector) was shaped very much like a water fountain spraying straight up (or a mushroom cloud, pointed at the base). Through the telescope I noticed a point-source of light traveling with the cloud, near the tip, or base.

 This point-source varied up and down in magnitude slowly, averaging around 5th magnitude, but every so often (between 10 and 60 seconds or so) it would flare to perhaps ?2 magnitude, instantaneously, as if sunlight were reflecting from a flat surface, as is observed with tumbling satellites.

 Movement was in a straight line. At initial sighting this was approximately 3/4 degree per minute. Object speed slowed as it progressed across the sky, indicating to me that it was traveling in a straight line, as opposed to orbiting Earth. The brightness of the cloud diminished as well, though more rapidly than the point-source.

 At the end of the observation the cloud was no longer visible, only the point-source, which by this time had faded to average magnitude of 10 to 11, still flaring to magnitude 4 or so. Movement had slowed to about 120 arc seconds per 10 seconds.

 To summarize, object was first sighted in Cassiopeia, approx Alt. 65 degrees, Az. 5 degrees (R.A. 0h10m x Dec. 55 deg.). After approximately one hour, final sighting was in Lynx at approx Alt. 40 degrees, Az. 60 (R.A. 6h40m x Dec. 55 deg.) Object traversed approx 55 degrees.

 I have sketched the view through the telescope, indicating the location of the point-source of light, the direction of travel, and the direction of North. I will e-mail the sketch.

 Also I took several photos with a 35mm SLR, ranging from 30 to 60 seconds each on ISO 200 film. When I get it developed I will send those pictures. The film had been in the camera for a long time, hopefully the pictures will come out okay.

My brother and I and one of our friends were outside when I got home from work. They saw the object initially around 17:30 and claimed it to be much brighter than it was later on. They claimed the object moved erratically until it finally settled in an area straight up from our position. Initially, I thought the object was the recent comet that burst into a cloud as the object was cloudy with a prominent bright spot on the lower part of it. However, the comet shouldn't be as bright as this was nor was it in the right place... therein it wasn't the comet.

We walked outside to get in the car and my son asked ""Daddy, is that Venus in the sky?""  I thought it was comet Holmes, so I told him that, ""No, that is a comet!  It must have become brighter again!""  On our way to eat, we called a few people, none of them were able to see it from their vantage point.  When we got back about an hour later, it was gone.  Just plain gone.

I do know what a comet looks like, as I was an astronomy teaching assistant for four years.  This object was about the width of the moon, about ""three moons"" in length (full moons) and the 'points' were about as bright as Jupiter.  The 'tail' was clearly visible, but spread out in a cone shape.  I looked on the internet, and found out that there was a ""There was a Centaur rocket fuel dump"" this evening that was supposed to look like a short lived comet.  What we saw matched this description, but we do not know where in the sky the fuel dump was to be seen.  We saw this in between Perseus, Auriga, and Camelopardalis.  About.

The object did not appear to move, and was white in color.

I went outside to replace a fuse in my Christmas lights. The time was between 18:10 and 18:40 .I was conscious of the time because I had to take my son to school for a function at 18:40. I looked up in the sky and saw what I first took to be a comet, but I did not think there were any comets around.

 I then decided that it was just a star and distortion from my glasses lenses was causing me to see a tail. Normally if an object is distorted by my lenses I can look dead on at an object and the distortion will clear. In this case however, no matter what direction I looked at the object, the tail remained. I was in a hurry and just decided that because this thing definitely had a tail I guess that I had missed the fact on the news that there was comet visible in the night sky. I then justified this decision by thinking that I remembered hearing on the radio about a comet.

 The object looked to me very similar Hale Bopp. I did not study it for more than a few minutes, knew it was out of place, then justified why and went about my business. It had enough impact on me to look for it again, when I went to unplug my Christmas lights, but I could not locate it. I didn?t think much of it until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast To Coast. Sorry I didn?t study the object closer.

 We were walking east and the object was about as bright as a large defined star in the sky with a cloud surrrounding it.  The cloud had the appearance of being slightly leading the star point in the front facing west, but the cloud mostly trailed to the east as if the object were traveling due west.  As I am very familiar with my position on the ground, I am positive this is the direction aspect in which the object was traveling although it did not look as though it were moving as it must have been at such a height, so as movement was undetectible without careful constant observation.

 I am also familiar with NASA launches and this did not originate nor was it anywhere near the direction of Cape Canaveral.  It was not a conventional aircraft either as I am very familiar all types of commercial aircraft and most military aircraft.

It reminded me of Comet Halle-Bopp, but was moving to fast for it to be a comet.  I ran for my binoculars as fast as I could.

It first appeared very bright, even to the naked eye, then seemed to split at which time the cigar shape was very apparent.  It seemed to grow in length with a luminescent debris field on either side.  My boyfriend noticed that the object would blink every 3-5 minutes.    My first thought was ?space station accident? but we were not scheduled for a fly-over that night.   We watched it until it dissipated, about 30 ? 45 minutes in duration.

I originally thought it was that comet that was visible a few weeks ago and passed it off as that, but my brother then told me over the phone that there was a light intermittently flashing with no apparent frequency or pattern.  After 10-15 minutes of watching I concluded that it was definitely not an airplane or satellite.  The object didn't appear to be moving in a straight direction and looked to me as if it was actually moving away from Earth.  I did see the flashing light (white) and the 'tail' was shaped similar to a comma.  As you can tell by my lack of reference points in regards to constellations or stars, I'm not an astronomer, however I am certain the object had to be some sort of rocket or a freak natural phenomena (but that doesn't explain the flashing light).

It was a bright light, not unlike a satellite but moving in a north to south direction; Brighter than any star. There were no other lights or colors associated with it.

It continued moving south in atypical movements characteristics of an airplane or helicopter. It didn?t move like an airplane and there was no noise. It was traveling fairly fast and suddenly slowed down and them took a short oblique move to the right and then to the left and the continued south. Too fast and abrupt to be a helicopter or aircraft.

It continued south for two or three seconds and then started to fade and disappear. Did not get a chance to observe it with binoculars.

Within seconds after the light faded away, an aircraft (identified by flashing red and blue lights and noise) appeared above the tree line due south and passed directly along the same path as the object but heading north. There was no bright white present as with the unidentified object.

I was in a hurry to meet my wife and couldn?t stay around to check further. I thought the aircraft I observed heading north may have seen the UFO and perhaps was pursuing it???

Just to state, I was just driving home from a friends tonight when I saw it. It is now 12:05 AM as I write this sentence. What I saw happened not less than an hour ago.

 I was driving westbound on Old Sumner Buckley Highway just behind the fairly recently built Target. I was on the phone with my girlfriend at a redlight admiring the stars on an unusually clear night. I then proceeded westbound with the greenlight when to my right (north of me) I saw a bright light moving VERY swiftly in an arcing vector. It was moving relatively parallel to me heading westbound and dissapeared behind the treeline. It looked as if it were already on a trajectory somewhat like a missile coming down to a target in an arcing manor. To be honest as stupid as it sounds, I thought it was in fact a missile. It looked fairly high in the sky but nothing like an airplane. Maybe a 2 or 3 thousand feet at the highest. It came eastbound across a large field in a straight trajectory until getting closer to the treeline when it took I'd say a 15-20 degree angle change and dove in a curving manor behind the treeline. All of this happened so quickly, it couldn't have been more than a second. It must have moved a a mile or so in that time.

 The light was basically just a white ball. There was no tail like a comet what have and no blinking lights like an airplane. That's why I thought it might have been the tail of the missile and not a comet or something. After it passed however, there was no exhaust trail and furthermore why would there be a missile flying over Bonney Lake. I then repeated what I saw to my girlfriend who is thanks to me probably having trouble falling asleep right now. I took a few side roads driving home in hopes of seeing it again, but had no such luck. I've never reported a UFO before and feel silly doing so right now, but I'm sort of hoping to find out what it really was or could have been.

It was a partly cloudy early morning it was still dark. I had been fishing with my father on the Dania Beach pier since midnight. It was also a moonlit sky, with the Moon positioned over the Eastern sky which lit up the water and clouds below,  As I looked out over the surf I witnessed a red light coming from my left field of vision moving left to right over the water, a few miles out. Behind this light, my father and I witnessed two contrails that were lit up by the moonlight, which seemed to chase this bright red light, which did not pulsate or change color.

 The light suddenly stopped for a second and lowered its elevation, made a quick maneuver to the right and continued south along the coast. The contrails could not keep pace with the light, which then again stopped, this time the orb seemed to expand and become brighter. It then bursted into many fine particles like an industrial firework, then this same process went into reverse and it seemed to implode and collapse on itself and then disappeared over the water. No sound was heard or did we see debris of any kind fall from the orb. My jaw just dropped and we could not believe what we had just witnessed. The contrails finally fizzed.

 In a matter of a minute we then witnessed two military jets fly into this area over the water. They were military because they had one red pulsing light on the fuselage and I grew up on an air force base and I am familiar with how fast they move.  These jets were probably scrambled from Homestead AFB. We then thought, could the military be conducting missile tests over open waters right off the coast? We tried to come up with a rational explanation. Until this day I feel that the military was trying to shoot this object (UFO) down.

 	Souderton is a small town about 20 miles north of Philadelphia.

I mention these facilities because I don?t necessarily believe that what I saw was extraterrestrial.

 That being stated, here it goes.

 	I was driving North on Route 113 just between Souderton and Kulpsville, PA at about 2:30 AM. It was a clear night and there was no one else on the road. There were open fields to my left and right. Out of the corner of my left eye a bright blue flashing light caught my attention. When I looked to my left I noticed there were two of them traveling towards each other at separate altitudes (I have no idea how far away or how high) traveling at slow speed.

 	I stopped at a traffic light and watched them head towards each other for a few seconds. When the two lights were aligned vertically they stopped in mid air (what appeared to be about 4000 feet apart), and something round and glowing orange dropped from the light/object on top and collided with the bottom light/object. There was a small white flash (like a strobe light) and all 3 were both gone.

 	I don?t really know what I saw. I have read other reports like mine that occur around military installations, so at first I chalked this up to a flare test or something?..but over a residential area? I have never seen flares hang motionless in the air or travel in a vertical trajectory.

 Perhaps I saw a high altitude missile interceptor test. This region of Pennsylvania was ringed with Nike Ajax installations in the 60?s and 70?s. They were supposedly ?de-activated? by 1975. I have my doubts though.

Must have been between 9 PM and Midnight. it was foggy, ie, marine layer pouring over the hill separating our area from the pacific.

We looked up and saw stationary lights, I'd guess no more than 1000 feet up, probably 500. No sound other than the traffic on 101. It was at least 300 feet long, as it was dark no shape could be determined. Lights on the object were flicking on and off in random. At one point we saw a flume of thick white vapor (steam? smoke?) pumping out directly adjacent to one of its lights. As the vapor was not being batted away by turbulence we knew it couldn't be a Chinook Helicopter, and it was certainly twice a Chinook's length. Eventually it moved west out of vision. We were surprised this hadn't been seen by the volume of traffic on 101.

Next day in the San Francisco Chronicle (daily paper) it was reported that many had called in about 'something' and the official response was test firing of a Minuteman missile. They fired/tested them going west over the Pacific. Of course, this was either coincidence or absurd. We observed this stationary object for a quarter of an hour.

Per the article in the SF CHRONICLE (surely researchable) the exact date could be determined.

 This experience made both I and my friend calmly believing we had observed a craft unknown to both us or the public. Silent, huge, hovering, no turbulence.

	The date given is approximate because it was over 30 years ago. Back in that day they didn?t have computers, the Internet, or any other way that we were aware of to report such things as this. In order to understand the event it is necessary for me to describe the circumstances. At this time in that area jobs were difficult to come by and those that were available barley paid enough to live on. We lived on a farm and grew our own vegetables and hunted and fished in order to survive. My friends and myself would sometimes supplement our meat supply by hunting rabbits on the roads outside of town at night. It?s not as dangerous as it sounds because as this was mostly large farms at the time the houses were two to three miles apart in places so there was little if any chance of hitting anyone or anything with a small 22 cal. rifle. I had become an expert marksman and it was not uncommon for me to make shots of 150 to 200 yards. Hunger makes you a good shot I guess.  I can approximate the year because I was 16 at the time, The month, November, coincides with the beginning of rabbit season, about the 15th. Obviously we weren?t all that concerned about the law as it was illegal to hunt from a car but if you took rabbits outside of season for consumption you ran the risk of contracting what we called rabbit fever. I estimated the time to be around 2300 hrs. because we didn?t go out any earlier to lower the risk of running across the police, and we had just started. OK, all of that being said, here is the story.

On the night in question myself, and two friends, were cruising around in my car with the top down. It?s cold in November but the top of the windshield made a perfect shooter?s ledge to steady the rifle.  The older of the two, a fellow about 25 years old and a Viet Nam vet, was driving. He was a large individual and was pretty much scared of nothing. My other friend, the same age as me, was in the back seat, and I was in the front passenger seat. We had driven a mile or two East of town and had just turned South onto a long straight road. I don?t remember the name but could probably locate it on a map. After traveling about a block or two I saw a rabbit about 200 yards in front of us. I told the driver and he slowly proceeded to with about 150 yards and shut off the engine so the vibration would not throw off my shot. I took my position, acquired the animal in my scope, accounted for bullet drop and windage, held my breath, and squeezed the trigger. The rabbit dropped immediately. A perfect shot. As I put the rifle back between the seats the driver got out of the car, to relieve himself I think. My friend in the back wanted out too so I had to get out being it was a two door.

	We were facing South and to our right was a field approximately 400 to 500 yards wide and I would guess about ? of a mile long. At the West edge of that was a line of trees ranging from about 75 feet high to 50 feet high that ran the entire length of the field. I was facing East and my friend from the back was facing West. I heard him say ?look? and as I turned around I saw this orange ball floating just above the tree line. I would estimate it to have been approximately 75 to 100 feet in diameter. At this point I?m not scared, just interested. I came around to the driver?s side and just leaned on the trunk and watched. The ball was moving very slowly from South to North just above the tree line. I followed the tree line exactly, up and down as it continued. The object made no sound of any kind. It was completely silent. At this time my younger friend and myself didn?t know what a UFO even was. The object continued to glide along the tree tops until it was straight across from us at which point I got my rifle from the front seat and pointed it towards the object. I wasn?t going to shoot at it I just wanted to look through the scope to see if I could see any better. At that point the object began to change from orange to a bright yellow. The light it gave off was almost like the sun as best as I can describe it. My friend that was driving grabbed the rifle out of my hands, threw it in the car, got in and tried to start it but for whatever reason it wouldn?t start. I doubt it had anything to do with the UFO, it was just junk. Within a few seconds the object seemed to shrink and disappear towards the Northwest. Looking back I doubt that it shrank but more probably just moved away so quickly it appeared that way. I estimate that this whole event occurred over a period of about 20 minutes or so.

	My friend was still trying to get the car started and I noticed that he seemed to be terrified. Not scared, terrified. He was visibly shaking and I think he might have been crying. It was a long tome age. I found this strange as he had seen combat in Viet Nam and would fight anybody at the drop of a hat. When the car finally did start, he put it in reverse and I had to jump over the door to get in because he wasn?t waiting. He wouldn?t even pull up so I could get my rabbit. We headed back to town at well in excess of 80 mils per hour and I was more afraid of his driving than I was of the UFO. I finally got him to pull over and let me drive. I put up the top, turned on the heater, and headed back to town. After he calmed down he began to explain to us about UFOs and having seen them before. I got the feeling that there was more that he wasn?t telling but he didn?t seem to want to talk about it.

	We went and found my step-father, who was town marshal at the time, and started to relay to him what we had seen. At first he thought we had been drinking (we hadn?t) or we were joking. After talking to us for awhile he decided we were serious and sober so he checked with the airport in Indianapolis to see if there any planes, helicopters, ect., in the area and was told that there were not and that nothing had shown up on the radar. He also relayed our report to the Rush County Sheriff?s Dept. Of course nothing ever came of any of it.

	Let me end by answering the skeptics. I spent a great deal of my time as a youth outdoors in the woods at night, coon hunting, trapping, ect. I have seen ball lightening, it wasn?t that. There are no swamps anywhere near that area. There were no power lines overhead. You cannot see the airport search lights from there. I never saw anything like that before that time or since. Later in life I move to Ohio and became a police officer where I served for 20 years and worked a lot of midnight shifts. I spent a lot of time looking but never saw anything like that again. To this day I don?t know what to make of it but there it is.

Immediately afterward, a second ""star"", which was very near the first one, shot to downward and diagonally to the right at about a 30 degree angle.  Both disappeared out of my line of sight, as if past the edge of the Earth.  I told my husband, who used to study astronomy, and I asked him whether comets move like that.  He said no.  I didn't think about it again until I saw the Larry King Live report on mass sightings, so I thought I'd report it.

Although I myself have not seen a UFO, members of my family and friends have had various types of sightings.  To the best of my knowledge, only one has ever been reported (July 2006 in Virginia).  I feel that perhaps some of these stories may be helpful in collaborating other sightings.  All of these individuals are down to earth, honest, and intelligent, and have no reason to fabricate.

 The July 2006 sighting that my son?s half sister and her boyfriend reported:  They saw an extremely large triangular shaped object over her boyfriend?s rural home in Virginia.  It moved slowly, also with no noise.  It was in the evening and had lights. They watched it for several minutes and when it seemed to notice them, it shone a light over them.  They were also completely frightened by it.

 The following is a list of other sightings; exact dates are unknown.

 Early 60?s ? my sister and brother drove over a hill on a farm road outside Dell City, Texas, and stopped when they found gigantic tumbleweed blocking the road.  As they were trying to decide if they could go around it, it suddenly lifted noiselessly off the ground and slowly rose straight up, then shot across the sky.  It happened in broad daylight, they were very frightened by it, and their story has never changed over the years.

 1995 ? a niece and nephew spotted an extremely large triangular object moving slowly over Las Cruces, NM, and followed it for some time.  It appeared to follow the Rio Grande River, moving from south to north.  It was nighttime, was lighted around the perimeter, and had a low hum.  They also noted several military helicopters in the area that also appeared to be following it.  My nephew is now an English professor at the DABCC of New Mexico State University.

 Early 80?s ? a good friend who was living on a ranch outside Tatum, NM told me of seeing an extremely large object over their ranch home.  It occurred around dusk, and her teenage daughter and two of her teenage girlfriends also saw it.  As it was told to me, the daughter and a friend were sitting outside waiting for another girlfriend to arrive when the object suddenly came over a nearby hill and hovered over their home.  The girls ran in and told the mother (my friend) who was on the phone with her husband.  My friend told her husband to hold on, and put the phone down while they all went outside to look at it.  As the other girlfriend?s approaching car became visible in the distance, the object suddenly sped over to the car and followed it to the house.  The girls were completely hysterical and as they watched, the object suddenly went straight up and across the sky.  It had some lights and moved noiselessly.  When my friend told my husband and I this story, her husband confirmed it, as he had heard them all screaming while he was holding on the phone.

 1998 ? another one of my four sisters also encountered something mysterious, possibly a UFO.  She was driving on Interstate 25, from her home just north of Las Cruces, NM to the university for a class she was taking when she noticed a small blue ball flying alongside her car.  At first she thought it was a reflection, but then it started to move around her car.  It continued to follow her car for some distance and it freaked her out completely.  When she got off the Interstate ramp at the University she drove straight to another sister?s home a few blocks away.  This other sister confirms her story and says it took a long time to calm her down.  She and her husband had to drive her home.

 August ? 2007   My son, who is 36 and a schoolteacher, and his mother-in-law both saw what they describe as a ?large invisible object? cross the early evening sky.  They noticed this invisible object because it blocked out the emerging stars as it crossed the sky.  As it moved slowly and noiselessly across the sky, they could note the triangular shape.  They also noted some military helicopters in the area right after the sighting.

 I also have a cousin who is a missile guidance engineer at White Sands Missile Range who has told me on that he has been present on several occasions when pilots have returned from flights and reported seeing UFO?s.  On these occasions, if any photos or videos were taken, there is always a group of government personnel (unknown dept.) who show up and confiscate the photos or video.","Retired",NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"We have requested that the source of the reports below re-submit them individually.

It was very light green in color and was more like a short bullet instead of a longer cigar shape.  It was traveling from west to east in a level flight path.  

My perception was that it was about a mile or two from my location.  I watched it for 6 or 7 seconds before it disappeared from my view because of trees along the road I was walking on.  

It impacted my memory because of it's shape and color.  I had never seen any object in the sky with its distinctive pale green color.  It definitely had no perceptible wings.

I was in the field behind the old Walmart by ave P (Rancho Vista blvd) and 3rd st east, lying on my back in the dirt, because I had just been in a heated argument with my girl friend, whom I lived with at the time, and I had to leave the house, and the field was the only place I could go without having to walk around for a few hours. While I lied there, just clearing my mind, and looking at the stars and planes in the night sky, I noticed  light /sphere  approx. 30-60 miles away in the dist, high in the north sky.

 It danced, almost doing loop d? loops up and down in an erratic pattern. It seemed that it was above Lancaster , but cant say for sure.  Not beleving what I was seeing, I put my right thumb up next to it and a star  nearby and held it still to see if possibly my eyes or head were moving , but sure enough, I was able to assure myself I was not hallucinating. After a couple of minutes of watching this thing, and assuming it was some experimental craft or missile from Skunkworks, I lost interest for a few moments. When looking back to see study the object more I noticed it bob and weave, then rapidly move out of sight in a north bound direction.

 For the longest time I thought it was some experimental guided missile. But why  would the Gov. test the object near a populated area. I've seen the YF22?s hovering about the palmdale airport area before and the donut shaped contrails in the nineties, but only seem something similar on future weapons.  This thing was to crazy to test around here. that?s all my gut feeling tells me.

Photographing Lunar Eclipse with 10 PX Digital Canon camera without flash.

 Upon loading pictures into laptop, picture frame number 2389 revealed six spherical objects in a definite formation: 2-white spheres (one brightly lit sphere above a dimmer sphere) - 1 red sphere, 2-white spheres, then 1 red sphere.  All were perfectly aligned and distanced. Reviewing the enlarged image, the red spheres appear to have 2 red objects or lights attached.

 The 2-white spheres bypassed the other spheres, taking the lead.  All spheres and flight paths were captured in the image.  Photo frames 2388 and 2390 did not contain the spheres which means they had to appear/disappear within 2 minutes.

 Since on the Eastern U.S. at 22:35, the spheres unlikely to have been related to the Pacific shooting down of the spy satellite -- spheres traveling in opposite  direction -- satellite was shot down at 22:30 Pacific time, not Eastern. Only one missile used -- 6 spheres shown.  One speculation it could be satellite remnants re-entering atmosphere but unlikely due to the exact alignment, precision of distance between objects, and mere number of objects.

 Other possibility would be meteors but precisioning of objects and containing white as well as red spheres may rule that out.

 Cannot be stars since there are no formations of that type below the moon.  In addition, they do not appear before or after frame 2389.

THE REASON I NOTICED THE OBJECT WAS DUE TO THE PASSING OF AN AIRLINER JUST BEFORE AND I WAS WATCHING THE PROGRESS OF THE IT MOVING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION. THE UFO LATER USED THE SAME PATH. COULD NOT TELL THE ALTITUDE OF IT, BUT SEEMED TO BE AT THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE AIRLINER. HOWEVER MUCH LARGER.

I LATER ASSUMED THAT IT COULD BE A SECRET TYPE OF CRAFT OWNED BY THE MILITARY AND KEPT HUSH HUSH ABOUT THE OBJECT. I FELT ODD ABOUT REPORTING THIS IN THE PASS, BUT FINALLY REALIZED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY EITHER NOT SEEN ON THEIR RADAR OR THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE LIKE THIS BEFORE OR SINCE.

I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF ANY ONE HAS SEEN AN OBJECT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN THE PASS OR RECENT HISTORY. I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED WEATHER THESE UFO OBJECTS ARE FROM OUT FUTURE OR ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM.

This probably isn?t anything but it was certainly odd to me. 

I was on my cell phone on my back deck and was watching a small plane take off over the tree line from the Rocky Mount-Wilson Airport.  

A brighter light caught my attention and I looked straight up to see what I thought at first was a star but it got brighter to the point that it looked  as if I was seeing the bottom of a rocket or missile as it fired. It appeared stationary and further up than the airplanes in the sky. 

I could not see any strobe lights or any other flashing lights that airplanes usually have. The object appeared to travel straight away from me up and became very dim in the period of about 3 seconds and then became dim and traveled in a southern direction until it disappeared about 2 seconds later.

The events started in 1991.  I remember this because my brother had been sent to Iraq for Operation Provide Comfort.  It was dark, and it was nearing the fall of the year.  My sister (11), myself (12), and my mother (37) were all traveling north on Highway 65 in Greenbrier, AR on the way to a friend?s home. < sighting location 35.2xxxxxx,-92.3xxxxx > We were approaching the center of town which had been marked with a new stop light.  

As we approached, I saw a giant ball of amber colored light to the Northwest.  It was about 45 degrees from the horizon and about 300 feet out and must have been 30? in diameter or more.  I exclaimed to my mother ?oh God, what is that??  I remember having the fear of missile attacks from the war that had been taking place.  My mother and my sister both looked on in awe and my mother stated franticly that she didn?t know what it was.  After about 10 seconds, the orb started to produce ?offspring? which went from dim blips to equivalent phenomenon of the original.  They all just popped out and hovered there over the city.  We were all panicked.  After about 8 more seconds, the orbs appeared to shoot straight out to the North at undeterminable speeds.  In a fraction of a second they were at a great distance but then hovered for another moment in formation and then split apart and disappeared into the night again.  We continued to see the orbs in single and sometimes double formations several times as we continued to our friend?s home.  We didn?t have a cellular phone at the time, but as soon as we arrived at the friend?s home, we called a mutual friend who was a hobbyist astronomer.  He too was able to witness the objects and called in an inquiry on all of our behalf to the Air Force.  We along with the other friends (totaling 7 on this event) witnessed them for the next couple of hours sporadically in the sky.

	The next time that I witnessed these objects was about a year later with my friend.  We were playing football in his yard around August of 92.  This was the most peculiar time that I have ever been subject to these types of happenings.  He lives in the same proximity of the first sightings. < Sighting Location 35.2xxxxx,-92.3xxxxx >  As we were tossing the ball back an forth at dusk, there were some scattered patchy clouds in the lower atmosphere, but there was still good visibility.  The next sequence of events is almost unbelievable to myself, and I was very near leaving them out because I want to be taken seriously; however in the name of truth and science I will include them.  I felt an eerie numb come over me and I fell to my knees with a dumb gaze at the Northern sky.  My friend was baffled and ran over to me and was asking ?what?s wrong with you dude??  He was curious as to why I had stopped playing and fell down and was gazing up.  I was paralyzed, and my stare was fixed directly above his neighbor?s home in a small patch of clouds.  He shook me by the shoulder telling me to get up with some concern on his face.  I managed to speak.  I was able to raise my right arm and point to the focal position that I was fixed on and simply said ?watch?.  He looked where I told him to look.  Nothing appeared at first and he started asking expectantly ?what?what do you want me to see??  It was no sooner than he had spoken the words that the first one appeared.  A giant orb of amber light appeared over the home, just popping out of the low level cloud formation.  My friend looked on in terror and in wonder and begged me to tell him what it was.  I was still numb and stuck from a fear or reaction that I cannot to this day explain.  Moments later, two more lights formed out of the originator and they hovered in formation by it?s side.  They were in the clouds and caused illumination to the particles around them which created an orange glowing haze.  The objects came very close to us, and this is the closest that! I have ever been to them in all of my experiences.  My friend had his 4 wheeler in the front yard, and he yanked me up off of the ground as he panicked and tried to get us away.  The 4 wheeler had worked all day, but when we tried to start it, no ignition took place.  After about 5 failed attempts to start the ATV, he dragged me inside the house.  He got a gun, and called our friends mother to help us.  We huddled down in the house until she arrived.  My friend?s mother came to get us later and was amused by the story, until a short time later when she saw what we had told her about.  I have continued to see these things, and can document every sighting location.  There are at least 4 other significant events that I would be glad to go over if the interest is there.  Please let me know if you can put this to use.  I am very interested and willing to put forth some effort to document these happenings as I am sure that they can be reproduced.  The areas that I am familiar with have been sites where many of my friends and family have witnessed this phenomenon spanning over almost 20 years.  My friend?s mother has a friend that has recorded these things on VHS, and I believe that they can be observed possibly with time lapsed equipment or intelligent motion sensing equipment.  I personally do not have the means alone to make such productions yet, however I do believe that this is achievable.  Thank you for your time in advance, and I can assure you very credible witnesses and contacts are easily produced.  One interesting fact about the region where I grew up (and I don?t know if this has/had something to do with the frequency but there used to be subterranean nuclear missile silos within just a couple of miles in both directions of the indicated areas.  Although these had been removed for several years before ?my? sightings, I feel that it is significant that I mention these because they are the only other source of any sort of combined or specific energy known to be out of the ordinary.  Thanks again for your tim! e and un derstanding in advance.

At first I thought it was someones special effects launch like a Sky Lantern round and brightly colored reddish orange like the color of Mars in the sky but as I directed my friends attention to the object we noticed that it began to move from west to east staying consistent in color and brightness. There were no clouds a slight breeze and was very clear. As we watched it move I noticed and confirmed this with my friend that there was a faint short very fine orange mist particle trail behind it.

I was at the Virginia Beach oceanfront with five friends on a summer night in 2003. Three of them left to go play pool. My friend and I went and sat on the beach around 80th street, a few miles down from the strip. When I first saw the green light, it looked like a dotted line being slowly drawn downward slowly in the sky. It seemed to be very wide and very high, miles out over the Atlantic Ocean. I pointed it out to my friend and we both just thought it looked cool. It stopped abruptly, but about 5 minutes later it returned, a little faster now, and it was a solid line. The light made one streak and then stopped. This line remained visible for quite awhile. My friend and I became very interested after that. I called my mother and a few friends to tell them to look for it. One of those friends was on as boat just off the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and she and her friends could see it from there.

We eventually settled back down, but an hour or so later the light returned. It started the same way, making a segmented line. When it came back as a solid line it made a broad, looping stroke in the sky. It was really bright green, and reminded me off a neon sign. My friend and I started to feel uneasy after the second appearance. There were other people scattered on the stretch off sand, and they all began pointing up and acting afraid. There was a group of around ten teenagers there from the Ukraine on work visas for the summer. They approached us and asked if we knew what was happening. Some of them seemed really scared. They sat and talked with us for another hour or so (it was between midnight and 1am) and then the light returned a third time. After its dotted stroke, the light made another sold line. This time the light swooped around a few times before culminating with an incredibly bright flash. At this point I became frightened as well, and I remember thinking we were seeing some kind of unfathomable missile or bomb approaching and that we were all going to be killed. Both the lines and the shape of the flash remained visible for what seemed like an hour. My other three friends came back sometime between 1 and 2 am. We told them what happened and one of them stayed on the beach with us and the Ukrainians. As I recounted the light appearances, it struck me that the three different shapes left by the solid line resembled the numbers 1, 2, and 3, in that order. This wasn?t completely true, however because the ""3"" had an extra swirl at the tail before the flash.

We were all completely amazed when it came back again, making the same dotted and solid line as it had the first time. I was scared, but I was also mesmerized and couldn?t tear myself away. We all just sat there watching the sky, wondering if it would keep coming back. When it did (again, about an hour later), it repeated the pattern of the second dotted and solid line. I was sure it would come back and repeat the third line and its flash, and just before dawn it did. I was still completely awed and so even as my companions went to bed, I stayed on the beach.

The cycle began to repeat itself a third time as the sky grew lighter. It was still visible after sunrise. I watched as the light again formed its first and second formations, but before the third pattern could be re-drawn, I succumbed to my exhaustion and went to sleep.

I remember wanting to see what the newspaper or local news would have to say about the lights, but I never heard anything about it. I assumed the stations would be flooded with calls from people in Virginia Beach and as far away as North Carolina, so I never even considered calling myself. I did do an internet search to see if there were any weird tests being done at nearby military bases, but came up empty-handed. I still tell people about it, and when I run into the friend who had been out there with me we ask each other whether we?ve figured out it was.  We haven?t, of course.

On March 24th or 25th My wife and I were out for a walk about 8:45 PM in Las Cruces, NM.  It was a clear night with bright stars and no clouds.  I saw two lights moving from the west towards the east in the sky moving at what appeared to be a constant speed and in a straight line, about as fast as a small airplane would be going.  The two lights had just flown almost directly over the Las Cruces Airport.  The two lights were bright white color and were not flashing or blinking.  One was in front and was a little larger and brighter than the one following it.  Their alignment was straight with the path and the distance between the lights remained constant.  They remained the same brightness until right before they disappeared which I will describe later.

I could not hear anything but I didn't think that was unusual.  I pointed the lights out to my wife and remarked how it might be an airplane except the lights weren't blinking and there were no red lights.  I said it seemed strange for a plane to not have flashing or blinking lights.  It crossed my mind that it could be a UFO but I still thought it was probably a plane.  She said it was a plane.

We watched it and within a few seconds noticed an airplane flying west by northwest.  The second plane had flashing red lights and non flashing white lights and didn't seem unusual in any way.  The plane and the lights we saw first were heading in a way that they looked like their paths would intersect.  They looked as if they were on a collision course.  So we watched, not really excpecting them to collide, but just watching.

When the plane and the lights intersected, it was hard to tell if the lights passed under or over the plane.  Their intersection appeared to happen almost directly overhead.  So far there was nothing really strange except for there being no flashing lights accompanying the two white lights.  The strange thing that happened was: immediately after the plane and lights intersected, the two white lights faded away to nothing.  the fading away was fairly fast but not instantaneous.  It seemed to take about a second for the fading to be complete.  Then the two white lights never reappeared.  There were no clouds and the airplane had just passed through the same part of the sky immedialty before yet it did not fade out of sight or even get dimmer momentarily.  The airplane was still visible and continued on it?s way.

We both thought what we had just seen was very strange.  I suggested it might have been an alien spaceship but my wife dismissed that idea.  I really can?t think of a good explanation for the lights fading away like that and a few people who I described it to also thought it was weird.

Neither my wife or I had been drinking or smoking anything.  I have not drank ( or smoked anything ) in over 23 years.  I am a computer scientist working for the Army at White Sands Missile Range and my wife is a Chinese immigrant.  It might be possible to check with the Las Cruces airport to see if  1 plane or 2 planes where flying over the area just to the east of the airport at around 8:45 PM on those nights.  I will try to remember exactly which night it was.

A friend and I were on the top floor (4th story) of my house, talking and smoking cigarettes out the window which faces west-- just north of Downtown Seattle. The sky was clear. As we looked to the north-west, near the Ballard area, we both observed a very large burnt-orange object slightly above the the skyline, about 3 to 4 miles away. The object was glowing and almost looking like a full moon that was on fire. Slightly above and to the north was another light that moved in slow, tight turns very close to the larger object. After about 45 seconds, the object began to change shape, it became more compact, almost as if it was flying away from us, and in less than 10 seconds, it was gone. There was nothing left behind in the sky.

After experiencing that, my friend and I tried to think of every option of what it could have been and still cannot come to any conclusions.

After posting a bulletin asking if anyone else had seen the object, a friend who lives in the area said he heard a loud ""electric/static"" sound and flashing orange lights out his window.

We observe this every night, near the moon and in several areas of the sky.  They look like bright stars, but move incredibly fast (changing direction suddenly).  We did research on the internet and some speculated that they were the ISS and/or satellites, however neither of these are applicable simply because of their rapid movement and extreme course changes.  I have no idea if we are seeing these due to our proximity to White Sands Missile Range, and this is mere coincidental speculation anyway.  My wife used our admittedly lower quality telescope, and the objects moved so fast they were leaving a 'streak' and very difficult to track and focus.  We are and have been avid skywatchers since childhood.  While I would like to find a perfectly logical answer to this, the simple truth is that in my 54 years I have never observed anything like this.  The 'stars' are unusually bright.  What my wife did glimpse is that the object looked round at first, and then changed shape (at this time she could not be more specific, however we will continue to watch and hopefully be able to provide more information).  A higher quality telescope will be in the future as well.  The most interesting of these objects appeared left of the moon last summer (June).  These objects are the last to vanish from the dawn sky, lasting much longer than the stars.  Any further commentary would be speculative which is not the purpose of this report.

While traveling east on Hwy 90 in them early morning hours (4:50 AM) of April 25th in the area of Morgan City Louisiana a orange pulsating streak of light in the sky caught my attention.

I only noticed it out of the driver?s side window because the pulsating glow caught my attention in the dark night sky.

At first I though it was a Radio tower light, but it was too long of a streak of orange in the sky and too high for it to be coming from a tower. It kind of looked like the fiery exhaust from a missile.

It was in the North East portion of the sky. I could see some stars behind it, but don?t know what constellation was in view at that time of the morning.

I estimate the orange streak was about 6? in length (using my thumb and forefinger at arms length) about 55 degrees above the horizon. It was a steady orange glow that kind of pulsated. It kind of looked like it had a head.

I pulled over on the side of the highway to observe it twice on my way to New Orleans and tried to video it with a cheap video camea I carry with me. The video did not come out.

It was still visible in the pre-dawn sky when I got to Avondale Louisiana and was almost directly over head at that time. I was not able to continue observing it due to heavy traffic a little after 6 AM.

It kind of reminded me of a comet with a tail, but I never heard anything in the news about one or anything else.

Hello,    

My name is ((name deleted)), a desert storm veteran and a 12 yr USAF veteran.  I want to make this report just to do my part so we can someday find out the truth.

My incident happened on Thanksgiving in 88 or 89.  I?m not really sure of the actual year, however, I am 100% certain of the day and of what I experienced.  I would like to add that at that time I was assigned to a Special Ops unit in the USAF out of Frankfurt Germany and I was just visiting my in-laws for the Thanksgiving Holiday.

My father in law and I went fishing up in the mountains of Alamogordo, NM on Thanksgiving.  We fished Silver lake all day and were suppose to come home early for dinner, but decided to stay late since the trout were biting pretty good that day.  By time we were on our way back home to Alamogordo, it was dark, however, it was a very clear night with no clouds or overcast.  We?re driving up and down hills coming from the mountains.  Alamorgodo, NM is home to Holliman AFB and next to the White sands missile range.  Also, this little city is based at the bottom of the mountain range and it is pretty flat down in the basin where the city sits.

Anyway, as we are going up and down hills, we finally get the part of the trip, where you can actually see the entire basin, the city and a little past the city, there are two large Mountains or very large Hills (they are the only two large landmarks on the other side), which are located behind the city from where we were coming from.  As we are driving I started looking at the two mountains ahead of us and I noticed some lights by them. As I started watching them fascinated by the brightness of them, I noticed that there were three lights and they were moving in odd ways.  One would go up vertically, then speed off at a 45 degree angle behind the mountain, then it would speed back in front of the mountain.  Then soon, 2 more lights joined them.  I would describe them as bright white spheres.  Anyway, these 5 spheres or lights, were just doing the most unimaginable maneuvers in front of these two mountains.  I watched them for about 3 minutes to make sure I was not seeing things and finally told my father in law about them.  He started watching them as well and after a couple of minutes, he stated what the hell is that? We watched them for over 15 minutes and the entire time they were flying, hovering, speeding from point to point and even at times disappearing and reappearing on the other side of the mountains.

I must state that I worked on the flight-line a lot, during the day and night and am very familiar with aircraft lights, at night, during the day and have a lot of experience working at night on the flight line. I can tell an aircraft or a helicopter with no problem.  I must also state that during my assignment in special ops, our unit worked closely with Navy Seabees, 82nd Airborne, USAF special forces (Combat Control Teams) and even had the opportunity to support Delta force.  Our unit covered all of Africa, Europe and the Middle East, so any missions, wars, conflicts or humanitarian efforts in those theaters, we covered and supported via the flight-line, during day, night, snow, sun etc..

Getting back to my incident.  I guess it?s hard for me to describe exactly what the 5 spheres were doing except by saying they were kinda of doing a star shaped pattern next to the mountains.  Also, I could not make out the details of the mountains, but I could see two huge dark silhouettes of the mountains.  These spheres were disappearing behind it then reappearing when they got to the other side.  It would take them maybe 1 or 2 seconds to go from the 1 o?clock of the mountains to the 7 o?clock position, then streak across the mountains again to the 3 o?clock position. Etc. If you draw a star with your pencil, that is exactly what they were doing.

I tried to draw a diagram below, with the mountains being the black and the patterns of these ORBS in red.  Please understand, that these crafts or lights, were disappearing behind the mountains and sometimes flying in front of the mountains, so I could see very well that they were in close proximity of those hills, where they could fly behind them and in front of them. These things were extremely fast and their maneuvers were unbelievable.  I have flown on a lot of military planes and  helicopters, I have been to many air shows, and as stated earlier have worked on the flight-line extensively.  So I have seen most USAF aircraft, F15, F16, A10, F18, B1 bomber, B2 bomber, etc T38, KC 135, C130, C5, C141, etc, etc,  I am very familiar with those aircrafts and what they look like and what they can do.

In conclusion, either I witnessed a new secret aircraft being tested that we have no knowledge about or I saw a UFO (I?m not saying flying saucer), just unidentified.  This incident has stayed with me for a long time and to this day, I cannot imagine any aircraft doing those maneuvers. These things were super super fast, agile and could stop on a dime.  As stated they would fly in front and the back of the two mountains so I could see them moving, speeding, disappearing, reappearing and hovering.

I guess we could have been maybe 5-10 miles away.  I could clearly see the silhouttes of the mountains and could see these things fly in front and in back of the mountains.  We were close to whitesands testing facilities, so either new technology or the dreaded word UFO.  I also am very aware of the SR71 and the fact that it was activated n 1964 or 68 and as an active duty member, we really didn?t start seeing pictures of it till about 84 so they kept that out of the public eye for a long time.  These things were not conventional aircrafts.  I currently work for the DOD as a logistician.

Thank you for your time.

Flying Saucer Encounter Compared with what I have read about other people's encounters mine is rather tame, and it is old, but I would like to have it on record, I am an Engineer having worked for companies involved in the design of aircraft, missiles, outer space vehicles and the like, as well as a math Professor, having taught at Long Island University, Brooklyn campus, some 25 years, ago.

This is my encounter; My then girl friend (wife now) lived at ((address deleted)) Rosemont Ave, La Jolla, California, which is right off the beach.

 On Sunday night, October 17, 1965, at 7:15PM, we were walking along the edge of the beach only 1 block from our apartment- We were very startled and amazed, when suddenly there came into view 4 flying saucers, going southbound, about 1/4 mile inland and less than ? mile in height.. They were flying fast in a diagonal  formation, were definitely piloted, each gently and separately undulating up and down as though slightly buffeted by the wind.  They emitted no lights and made not a single perceptible sound. We had been easily hearing birds chirping in the distance, but no engine sound or even a sound of airflow was perceptible, and the day was bright and clear and otherwise quiet. We were just out of earshot of the sound of waves hitting the beach.  These vehicles were not birds, not balloons, airplanes, not swamp gas, not temperature inversions, not kites, not anything but saucer-shaped vehicles. There could be no way we could be mistaken as everything was mid-day clear close view. My eyes happened to concentrate on the under rim of the saucers I saw a dark brown colored rim on the underside of the saucers of perhaps 2 feet in width. The vehicles otherwise were approximately the color of aluminum, I saw 3 hemispheric undercarriages spaced circularly at 120 degrees apart. I saw portholes. My girl friend's vision happened to concentrate on the top most portion and she saw yellow light in the port holes. They flew past us at perhaps 350 miles per hour and we had them in view maybe 6 seconds in all. They were less than 1/4 mile from us at the closest point. Based on the angle subtended by the vehicles and my estimate of the distance to them, I would make an educated guess that their sizes were about 150 feet in diameter each and perhaps 20 feet in height not counting the height of their undercarriages. They flew in the direction of the San Diego Airport and seemed to be totally unconcerned at being seen or if it was a danger to them. They appeared to be their own masters. I phoned the San Diego Airport, the! Miramar Naval Station and informed them as well as the local police. The police told me they had not received any calls thus far. Miramar Naval Station recorded my phone conversation but would not answer as to whether there were any other witnesses. After this encounter, my friend and I found a book in the library called ""Flying Saucers and Outer Space"", written maybe in 1955, On one page there was a drawing of a flying saucer   As soon as we saw it, we both said to each other ""that is just what we saw"". Mind you, prior to this, I and my friend had thought that those who said they saw flying saucers were seeing things by mass hallucinations, and gave these reports no credence at all. And neither of us had read a book at all on this subject. My girl friend became very frightened at this incident, and I, foolishly wished they would have just stopped and taken me aboard for a ride. But, having worked as a Mechanical Engineer in the Space industry for 20 years, and being well up on every flying vehicle known to man, for one thing I know of no vehicle now or even contemplated, that can fly without a very noisy engine to power it. If there was a noiseless engine it would have been put to very good use a long time ago, for example on the very expensive Concord Aircraft, which was only allowed to fly over uninhabited areas because of the incredibly loud noise it made. From this fact and my general feelings about this I must conclude (the U.S. government and any nay-sayers not withstanding) that these vehicles are of a very very advanced stage of technology and that they are not of this earth.

I was standing outside my back door, practically inside the door frame.  It was a very clear night, and I was just stargazing while I smoked a cigarette.

I noticed a bright light streak across the sky directly above me.  My first thoughts of the white streak was it might be a missile.  But then I realized it had no sound, and only lasted at most, 2 seconds.  The missile thoughts came to mind because over the past year, and more so in recent months, we have had numerous fly overs at EXTREMELY low altitudes of fighter jets, blackhawk helicopters, and cargo planes.  I actually have a photo of a fighter jet flying over, and as recently as June 1st, a formation fly over occured.  I ran inside and got my 12 year old brother, hoping maybe he could catch a glimpse of something to prove I wasn't going crazy at 23 years old!  Of course, my younger brother mocked me because of what I had seen.  Within 20 minutes of being outside again, we both saw a streak of light go across the sky.  From our vantage point, it moved east to west.  It was green in color, and seemed to skip over parts of the sky, as if it disappeared and reappeared right in front of us!  It covered a large distance in a matter of 6 seconds, at most.  My brother was amazed.

We decided to stay outside and try to see even more.  Ten minutes went by, and then we both noticed another streak go overhead.  It was white in color and gone within a second.  We both rushed inside and were a little shaken by the sights we had seen.

I coaxed my girlfriend outside late June 7th because she thought I was going insane.  It was a clear night once again.  We watched the stars slowly appear as the sun went down.  We noticed the moon to the west and saw saturn and venus closely next to the moon.  As we panned across the sky, going west to east we noticed what we thought was a star... Moving!  We could barely see it, but could easily see the movement.  It moved very subtle, very slow, and within about 6 seconds it was completely gone.

Last night, June 10th, I decided to go outside and sit on our back porch.  It was around 1:15 a.m.  I noticed the green streak again!  It appeared to be moving towards the ground, in intervals like the previous sightings.  It was farther east, in the direction of Holly Springs, MS.  I went back inside, and that's where I stayed.

I've gotten curious whether or not anyone else around the Memphis, TN area or northwest Mississippi area has seen the things I have witnessed within the last week or so.

One more note: The green streaks I saw also seemed to change towards a blue then an orange.","Dairy Manager",2,3,"flash",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2008,2000,2,6,0,"Night","South",0,1,0,1,0

On a cold winter evening my friend and I were driving into Meriden Ct. from Cheshire, Ct. We were driving in a small sports car on River Rd. near Red Bridge. I saw what I thought was the reflection of my shifter light on the windshield. I realized I was seeing something reflecting on the windshield from the outside. I pulled over, stopped my car and opened the window. Just above the tops of the telephone poles was an enormous diamond shaped craft. It was so close I could see that the surface looked like the dull side of aluminium foil. The underside had two bullet shaped ducts side by side with heat emitting from them. Maybe propulsion? No sound what so ever came from this craft. Around the perimeter was a redish/pink fuzzy difused light. The craft was traveling very slow. I wondered how it was staying in the air. It followed large high tension wires toward Hubbard park and was gone.   Totally unforgetable. I hope to witness again. I honestly felt no fear, only awe..

I asked my dad to look  at that light but he was fixated on the eclipse.  He said it was probably just an airplane.  Then I pointed out an airplane and how slow it was moving and he admitted that what we saw was moving way to fast to be a jet or an airplane.

It appeared as I said as if the sun itself had fallen from the sky because of its massive size and the circular diameter of the sphere, it made no sound and nor was there a sound previous to its appearance to indicate a major explosion of some magnitude coming from that region of the countryside, it appeared as though it was approximately 10 miles or so from the street we lived on that ran parallel to the trajectory of the object in question and that of the river the other side of the forest itself, it was heading in a north, northeasterly direction after reviewing my homes position to that of Hartford and the River that divided us, the Smith Family lived directly behind our house on the next block, the Zimmerman family a few more streets over from them. 

The silence of such a huge sphere ROLLING across the tree tops and emitting whipping flames from upon its surface gave you the feeling that the core of this object was solid while its surface was entirely engulfed in a all encompassing mass of burning gases and surface material, no wind, not a whisper of the massive flight of this globe of fire could be heard as it passed, no crash, no explosion, its as if it was headed toward the coastline and gravity had no effect on its elevation as it traveled the distance from which I was could visually detect and remain captivated by its enormous size and silence as it moved through the evening sky to a destination I had no indication would be anywhere close by as it disappeared in the evening sky.

I'd like to mention yet another personal experience, that wasn't so personal when you consider all the news at the time that was generated in the Community of Great Falls, Montana shortly after the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. It was months later and I had contacted a local priest from Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Great Falls. This priest has since been removed from active service with the general public, he has suffered a stroke on the left side of his body and his memory isn't exactly what it use to be. In the early 1980's, maybe around May of 1982, during that late spring month my wife and I was awakened by a glowing light from the back yard of our home that was hovering over our very large weeping willow tree, it was as if it had landed and was gathering information or discharging a genetic message. The air was still and the sounds in the distance echoed as if you were inside a tunnel. Across the alley, on the next block... 2606-5th Avenue South a police car was parked in the middle of the street looking directly into our backyard, the sound of breaking glass could be heard for a very brief second from that location, the whole area of the neighborhood was as if it were in a vacuum and echoed each sound as if you could detect a pin drop from down the street, the engine on the patrol car was silent and there was no other vehicle traffic that could be detected in the general area that was mobile, only the flashing lights of a police car setting in the middle of the road out back and it remained throughout the night. Above our tree was a cloud that resembled a Maltesse Cross, its four triangular shaped inner arms were of a stewing blackness that could only be understood from the depths outside our planets atmosphere, this is what's really particularly curious in relationship to the Enfield Connecticut incident where a report of a 4 pointed cross was reported earlier in the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania incident which I believe is one and the same in more ways than one! Very interesting coinci! dence in deed!!!    The other portions of that Maltesse Cross between the cross figure itself was pure white and just as luminous as the light of a full moon on a clear night, even that of a bright florescent blub. It hummed as though vibrating as though it was discharging a message or extracting a source of matter that had called it forth in that midnight hour. Maybe from beneath the earth at the roots of that tree a line of communication was being established with the earth itself and its inhabitants, maybe it was answering a question that's fimilar to us all.

This experience has vanished from most all records in the area after a military investigator came to the area and researched the sighting that many residents of Great Falls had reported to the Great Falls Tribune and to Military officials at Malmstrom AFB the days following its appearances, this phenomenon occurred during a period when I was employed for about a 6 month period as a supervisior at a local Sambo's Restraurant. The incident was centered at 2605-6th Avenue South in Great Falls , Montana . I still own the property there, for some reason I still feel attached after that experience, who wouldn't feel such a bond? This is yet another unexplained event that now appears to be totally erased from the record books because of government involvement. The priest I mentioned earlier is in a housing facility run by the church for aging priests in Great Falls . This priest was contacted by me the morning of that Maltesse Cross had hovered over our tree. I spoke with Father Hersinko a number of times about this event and told him that for some reason or another I was certain that Light would remain in the area for three more days and could be spotted above in the evening sky's canopy in its original shape in a northwest trajectory as a group of distinguished cloud formations resembling that Maltesse Cross or wheel with spokes; you think that during that time satillites would have detected this formation, maybe the military did! I expect the Great Falls Tribune that had front page coverage of this event from so many callers would still have information on this case in question, I think they do, but find it very difficult to locate. That priest after that event was over was removed from his position at Our Lady of Lourdes Church and placed in a small church about 30 miles out of town on Highway 200, I believe the town was Fort Shaw that serves about 150 perishioners. I found that strange seeing he was only in his earlier fifties and was the priest in charge of not only the church services, but the grade scho! ol it op erated in the community of Great Falls . Well, that night of the Maltesse Cross incident I told my wife as we stood 30 feet from that tree looking up at the swirling mass of black ink and that extremely white soft halo that divided the two prominent features into very distinct patterns that I should go and venture up to the tree and climb-up and see what if anything would occur... she ruled against it and seemed only interested in going back into the house and finishing her sleep. The police car was still parked in the middle of the street watching the figure with, I suspect, much interest. I imagine the police report was sanitized, as well in this actual case of multiple sightings that week, it shouldn't have been. Maybe you can further investigate and inform me as to what your findings were! Another aspect of this event which was discussed with the priest was the Montana State License Plate on my Vehicle, "" Sacrum"". I had mailed one of these license plates to Pope John Paul II with a note that his life was in immediate mortal danger, that was 7 days from the attempt on his life where he was shot and a bullet struck his sacrum bone, go figure... I had never written a letter like that to anyone before, quite a coincidence, I had never communicated with the church prior to this event, but I did have an undeniable urge to get personalized license plates earlier that year... it was a plate that caused some interest with local officals, I retired that license plate after that incident. I was mostly consumed with getting my wife pregnant, my doctor told me forget it after numerous visits to his office... around 9 months after the Maltesse Cross incident we had a son... in 1983. His eyes were as if oriental, that's always puzzled me a bit. He's a good son, he works two jobs, has graduated from college with 3 degrees in business, I feel I'm very blessed to have him. It's funny how life evolves, it's amazing the mysteries that sometimes make those blessings seem all the more important in our own particular lives! . If you find the information concerning this event in Great Falls during that time frame drop me a line, at the time I failed to document this important event in my life seeing it was all over the news at the get go.

Coming home after eating out in entering the apartment complexin a car with my friend driving, i spotted flicking lights of red and white light to the south moving really fast, I really didnt think it was anything weird, but as the lights kept moving I notice the shaped of the object  V-shaped!! I was amazed at the shape of the craft, other weird stuuf about it was that it was moving sideways at a really fast speed towards the N.Windham area, at the end of each side of the V shaped object was 2 balls of light, the one on the right was flicking the other was constant, I lost the object in the tree lines my friend said he didnt see anything just a V object, he is really skeptic of these stuff  I really think he saw what I saw. Another weird thing I notice was that its that this object was emiting light when the sun was still up! Ive seen planes fly in this area and about the same time of day and i dont see any lights from them. I posted this same bulletin a couple weeks ago but it never was posted. I also want to add that Ive seen weird things most people I know dont, Ive seen a Disk shaped Ufo up front in Buffalo , NY in the summer of 1997 , and since Ive moved here , IVe seen a couple of triangle shaped ones.

Peter Davenport,   

I want you to understand that the date of this FireBall  streaming across the treeline from my position facing toward Hartford in the south and to the existing river coming from the northeastern sector of the state from the other side of the forest just outside Enfield, Connecticut was the exact path this Orb took heading in a northeastern direction. It appeared as I said as if the sun itself had fallen from the sky because of its massive size and the circular diameter of the sphere, it made no sound and nor was there a sound previous to its appearance to indicate a major explosion of some magnitude coming from that region of the countryside, it appeared as though it was approximately 10 miles or so from the street we lived on that ran parallel to the trajectory of the object in question and that of the river on the other side of the forest, it was heading in a north, northeasterly direction after I reviewing my homes position to that of Hartford and the river that passed along side of Enfield and headed directly toward the Hartford vicinity, the Smith Family lived directly behind our house on the next block, the Zimmermans a few more streets over from them, if my bearings are correct. The silence of such a huge sphere ROLLING across the tree tops and emitting whipping flames from upon its surface gave you the feeling that the core of this object was solid while its surface was entirely engulfed in a all encompassing mass of burning gases and surface material, no wind, not a whisper of the massive flight of this globe of fire could be heard, no crash, no explosion, its as if it was headed toward the coastline and gravity had no effect on its elevation as it traveled the distance from which I was could visually detect and remain captivated by its enormous size and silence as it moved through the evening sky to a destination I had no indication wwas close by.

Fort Worth, Tx.

I was sitting outside in the dark looking at the sky and noticed what I at first thought was a star. Then it began moving around and changing directions real fast.

It was triangular shaped with white lights all around it and one red light. The lights were blinking or rotating. There appeared to be other smaller crafts darting toward it and then they would turn sharply and go in the opposite direction. And the large triangular craft would sort of chase after them. Either the smaller crafts were shooting at the larger one or vise a versa. But you could see smoke trails  all around it from what looked like missiles.

I went in the house and told my step-dad and he came outside too with his binoculars. We counted at least six of the larger crafts all around the sky.

We could see what looked like laser lights shooting all around it, then it looked almost like fireworks. Then I saw something out of the corner of my eye and had to take a double look. Above the trees and the house next door was a ball of fire falling slowly to the ground but it almost looked like a big balloon drifting down real slow. I yelled at my step-dad to look, we stood there watching it trying to figure out what it was. It was real close and it looked like it was landing in the back yard across the street. I tried to follow it but lost it. I know it must be in the close area.","Secretary",2,6,"triangle",1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2008,2000,3,7,23,"Night","South",0,1,0,0,0

We were at the Embassy Suites/The Point resort hotel on Kaua?i. My girlfriend?s son (13 yrs. old) and I (44 yrs. old) were facing northeast, talking. Our friend (35 yrs. old) was in the pool, facing northeast, talking to my girlfriend who was facing the rest of us, southwest.  It was about 9:30pm or 10pm.  This was July 18th.

My girlfriends son and I were facing my girlfriend and our other friend who were in the pool.  The pool is surrounded by condos and palm trees.  As we were all talking, I saw a neon glowing, oblong object ""fall"" from about 500 feet or less at a 45 degree angle, right over the building and palm trees, from right to left. The object was about 50 yards away from us. It disappeared behind the building.  Two of the others saw the same thing, except for them, it started out as a red object that turned green.  I thought I saw yellow inside the green and a black dot inside the yellow.

The funny thing is, there wasn?t a trail behind this object and it didn?t make any noise coming down and didn?t seem to crash into anything.  The size was very hard to determine.  It could have been the size of a basketball or it could have been the size of a small car.

Nothing went up in the sky, like a flare. No sound was heard from it. No sparks.  Just a closed looped, oblong shaped, red, then green/yellow/black object.

We weren?t drinking or anything else. No missile testing. Three of us saw it.  I?ve never seen a ?u.f.o.? before, neither had the others.","Photographer",3,1,"other",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2008,2000,3,7,21,"Evening","West",0,1,0,0,0

This happened to me 40 years ago.  Over these many years one sighting and an historical event that followed have haunted me and I have never known what I should have done at that time.  Heck I was 17 years old, driving home from cheerleading practice.  I questioned my own credibility that day.  Who would believe me? I told my mother when I got home that I saw a flying object that I couldn?t explain.  She had little to say other than, ""I don?t know what to say about that.""  

For what it is worth, here is my story:  April 4, 1968.  I remember the day because it was that evening that Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.  The events of that late afternoon coupled with his tragic death colored my world view forever.  I made a promise that I would remember everything.

I left the Gainesville High School gym at about 4:15 pm.  My family lived in a small brick ranch house on Lake Lanier about 6 miles outside of Gainesville, GA in Hall County.  I headed east on the Cleveland Hwy while listening to WDUN radio.  At that time the Cleveland Hwy. was a winding 2-lane road lined for most part by large trees and small residences sparsely spaced out.

There was a restaurant called The Big Bear at a bend in the road.  It was noted for the cage in the parking lot that housed a large bear.  (In hindsight this was a cruel thing, but in 1968 it was just a promotional gimmick for a dingy old restaurant.)  Once I cleared the bend and lost sight of the Big Bear, the landscape opened up.  Trees had been cleared years before to make room for Riverbend Baptist Church on the left and a small strip mall on the right.  The sun was very low and bright behind me at that point.  I recall that my rearview mirror caught the sun and I slowed down because its reflection in my mirror temporarily made seeing ahead more difficult.  I adjusted the mirror so I could see, but I still was going very slowly.

At that moment in front and above me I saw it.  The object had suddenly appeared from the south or southeast.  It came to a dead stop.  It did not waiver.  It hovered silently above the highway.  I looked in the rearview mirror to see if anyone was behind me and there wasn?t.  I wanted someone else to see this.  (There weren?t a lot of cars on the road because most people didn?t get off from work until 5 so I saw few cars in front or behind and passed few cars traveling in opposite direction.)  I slowed to almost a stop while my eyes fixed on what hung suspended ahead and in the air.  Its size I could not begin to guesstimate.   Its altitude I couldn?t say.  But I can say that it was metallic silver because the sun that had so bothered my eyes fropm the west reflected on part of the object.

I thought at first it must be a jet the military was testing.  But there was no noise, there were no windows or markings and I saw no lights.  It was daylight and if there were lights they had to be white and were indistinguishable from the sun?s rays that bounced off the right side of the cigar-shaped object.  I knew I was looking at whatever it was from the side.  It could have actually been a disk.  Its smooth shape was almost too perfect. It stayed there for a number of seconds, but it seemed like minutes to me because of all the thoughts that raced through my head.  My body felt as though something passed through it.  I vowed to remember every moment.  Maybe one day someone would want to know when I first saw an UFO.

All of a sudden it catapulted to my left and was gone.  Not a trace.  Not a sound. It was as though it disappeared, but for a nanosecond I did see movement and I know it headed north or northwest.  I simply don?t know which because the road twisted and turned often.

There was another strange occurrence at that moment it left.  The radio DJ or news reporter commented on Martin Luther King, Jr. being in Memphis.  I distinctly remember something about a garbage collectors strike.  Now I had given very little thought to King in my short life.  I heard the things my parents said and I had listened to the ""I Have a Dream"" speech which greatly impressed me.  But heck I lived in the Deep South and there was controversy that swirled around him.  Back to the story.  At the moment I heard the radio and saw the object disappear from sight a thought passed through me, MLK was going to die that day.  Now this thought came to me between 4:30 and 4:45 EST.  King was in Memphis and was shot at 6:01 pm.  It hadn?t happened yet. When I got home and after I told my mother about the UFO, I asked her if she had heard about King being killed. The question was asked because I thought it was strange that I was aware of his death and yet the radio announcer had said nothing.  I turned on the TV to see if there were any news bulletins.  During those times there was no 5 PM news.  There were no bulletins.  So I thought to myself, ""You are crazy.  That UFO has rattled you and crazy stuff is going through your head.""  I plopped down in front of the TV and was the typical teenager.

At some point that evening a news bulletin did come on and said King had been killed. My first thought was, ""Why did it take so long for the news to announce this?""  Then Walter Cronkite (I think it was him) said King was shot on the balcony of the Lorraine (sp) Hotel at 6 pm.  My heart started pounding.  That was wrong. He must have died earlier. You can?t imagine how I felt.  I had known something was going to happen to King, but I couldn?t interpret my instant knowledge at the time it was revealed to me.  I wouldn't have known what to do.  I thought I was crazy.

Over the years I felt such guilt.  I could have stopped it.  I could have called the radio, but I was so young and had never had anything happen to me that could be classified as weird.  The UFO sighting and the knowledge that King was going to die occurred almost simultaneously.  I didn?t sleep well that night.

So as you read, these two things are entwined for me.  I can never separate them.  Everything is so clear from that afternoon and evening and yet it was 40 years ago.

Since then when I hear about UFO sightings, I don?t doubt that some of them are true.  Over years I wondered what it was I saw.  Funny, I never thought of the object being piloted by aliens, at least not aliens of a hostile nature.  At some point during my college years I found peace about what it might be.  I came to believe that the UFO was piloted by the descendents of humans.  Maybe this seemed plausible because as a young child I loved science fiction.  I have always chosen to believe that time travel would one day be possible, far off into the very distant future.

 When the technology exists to transcend space and time, our descendents, whatever they are like, will come back to witness history.  I don?t believe they will or can tamper with us very much because if they do, they could be destroying themselves.  Their mere existence hinges on us.  The desire to understand from whence they came, what we looked like at this primitive stage, how we lived, and what formed our values is certainly things to study.  They are looking for themselves.  No, I don?t believe in aliens that truly are alien to us.  I believe in beings that have evolved and long left earth.  They have populated other celestial orbs.  They won?t bother me or anyone else.  I am one of their ancestors.

 I know that my story is in the distant past.  Before the Internet I didn?t concern myself about what or who I should tell my story.  It was shared over the years with only a few close friends.  Still before I aged anymore I wanted to tell my story for the record.  I saw something I couldn?t explain. It flew at a speed I couldn?t comprehend.  I don?t know why it stopped there or why I was the only car at that point past the bend.

 I have wondered if anyone else saw anything that day in North Georgia, but I never heard any stories on TV.  I presumed that either I was it or the others were like me.  It couldn?t be explained and people questioned their sanity.

 It still amazes me that NO ONE has taken a credible photo.  When these things appear they are often too far away to get clear shots.  No pilots who have claimed to see them up close even had a camera and could record it.  There have been so many hoaxes over the years that the few that have credibility are questioned.  I didn?t have a camera that day and even if I did, the event passed so quickly I could have never gotten a shot off.  Surely someone at some point with get a verifiable photo that can be blown up and will make it evident to everyone.  We are out there.

By the way, I have never seen another.  It was a one-time thing, but I still look up and hope that before I die I can see another.  If I do I won?t wait 40 years to share it with you.","Retired",1,1,"cigar",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1968,1960,2,4,14,"Afternoon","South",0,1,0,0,0

It was around 12:30 A.M or something around that and i had to go to the bathroom.  So i went outside to go.  I was on my way back into the tent when i heard a humming sound, so i looked up thinking it was just the helicopter that passes over my neighborhood at night.  I focused my vision because i couldn't really tell what it was and it was a really bright light that was shaped like a saucer. I called my friend out and so he came out and saw it and we both freaked because it was going really fast and it was flying lower than a helicopter would.

 So i went back in the tent and posted a bulletin on myspace talking about the alien but only one person believed me.  So then we started to text each other.  I didn't hear back from her for like an hour or so and she texted me saying that she was looking out her window and that she saw the same exact thing that i described up in the first paragraph and it was heading in the same direction that i said so we both started freaking out about it but i eventually went to bed.  I'm going to be looking out for another one tonight and i'll try to take a picture of it.

On 08/02/2008 about 2232 I was sitting on my back porch, looking at the sky, when I saw an extremely bright white flash low in the sky to the south of my location.  After the flash I saw a large, wide trail streaking towards the southwest.  The trail was yellowish in color, with green towards the leading edge.  After the flash and trail disappeared, there were two parallel gray streaks which lasted for several seconds.  It didn?t look like any meteor or fireball I have ever seen, maybe space debris re-entering?  It looked more like some type of exhaust trail or plume from a missile.  

I checked the local paper and the internet for any other reports, all I could locate was the following entry in an astronomy message board. Maybe someone can identify what TV station the person is talking about.

Object crashed by Ca. border last night.

Just heard on the news that an object was observed, looking much like a meteor, but changing directions, then hit the ground. News reported within sixteen minutes a bevy of military helicopters appeared, one being a large carrier that picked up the item, still glowing, and left due north towards Vegas.

At around 02:00 to 02:15 on sunday August 17th i was have a cigarette outside,I happened to look up and saw i strangest thing i ever saw in my life .

I'll tring to explain this the best way i know how.

It wasn't just 3 very large glowing lights in a triangle form on it's belly side above me at about 500 to 1000 ft Traveling at great speed moving from south london to north direction and lasted not even 2 sec.

It had like a wake of something coming from 2 sides.I guess because it was going so fast it look like what you would see in the movies when a bullet is going in slow motion breaking the air ,and it has a wake coming from it.

It had no sound what so ever not even a hiss or whisper and no vapor trail from behind it like a plane or jet leaves behind.i waited about 10 mins after the event to see if there was anything else i was waiting to a sonic boom but nothing but i guess if i did hear one it would have deafened me at that speed and distance from me.

Anyway thats about as best as i can do to describe what i saw.

I was watching the sky shortly with a clear sky above. There appeared to be a ""star"" directly NE at about 50 degrees above the horizon. There were multiple ""explosions?"" surrounding the ""star"" at random. From the eyes' view they seemed to be anywhere from directly next to it, to 3"" beyond it in any direction. The ""star"" would move in small amounts no more than 1cm from the eyes' view during the ""expolosions"" The explosions would look like another bright star that quickly appeared and disappeared.

I was watching the sunset from Ocean Beach, when I noticed the object just south of and a little above the sun on the horizon line.  I thought at first it was a plane, but there were no lights blinking on it like there were on a plane over the nearby Marin Headlands.  it seemed to be made of metal, or something that reflects, and the bottom of it was like the bottom of a bowl, reflecting the light of the sun beneath it.  The top of it was like a smaller, upside-bowl, and although it appeared to be solid, it seemed to be invisible except where the sunlight was reflecting off of it, like I was seeing the outline of a bubble in the light.  My second thought was that it was a missile, because it moved like a missile, like it was up so high and was far enough away to appear to be moving very slowly, but it was moving towards the beach. I watched it from 7:30 to 8:08 pm, when the fog rolled in, and it disappeared. Several other people on the beach also witnessed it and took pictures with their cell phones.

Our position was on Missile Road between the north boundary of Wichita Falls and Burkburnett, Texas and 1-2 miles from the airfield at Sheppard Air Force Base which was east of us.  Looking up and to our west, we saw this object that I would estimate west-northwest, possibly 50 plus miles away and possibly near the altitude of 10,000 feet.

At 7:00 P.M., the sky was clear and it was getting near sunset so we were guessing the object could be deflecting sunlight but this object was exceptionally illuminated and large for any aircraft.   We went to a nearby Wal-Mart, shopped and came outside and the object was still there and a bit closer.   We went home and the object was still there but more to our immediate west.  As my wife went to get our binoculars, I talked to a neighbor to justify what we were seeing and we all agreed we were seeing something unusual.  At 8:00-8:15, I saw through my binocular what seemed to be a balloon shape object sourcing this amazing golden-white light.  Upon further looks, this object appeared to be diamond shaped with an exception of being elongated and flat on the bottom.

I am contributing this because I would like to know if anyone in that area observed similar phenomena or craft. The fact that people can determine my identity is of no concern.

Note that 8 of 9 of observed craft were ""ordinary UFOs"" but the 9th one was not.

 ==  Contact with an investigator: that is up to you. I'll be glad to talk to someone, primarily as I said my reason for posting this information is to find if anyone in that area in that general time frame (or later, I suppose) had seen similar things.

It is easiest to reach me by email.

My UFO story

Before I myself saw UFOs, I had no strong opinion whether they existed - I assumed they could exist, but then we?re used to hard and incontrovertible evidence, and the lack of that - as experience available to other people, people who hadn?t already seen such evidence - makes it ?hard to swallow? in many cases. So, if some group of people in some metropolitan area reported the same phenomenon and the ?reason for the illusion? was not convincing, those people have seen UFOs, but that?s about as far as it goes. There?s nothing to do with the information but spread it to people willing to believe it. You wish you, the original observer, could replay the event for an audience and then they would agree.

I don?t remember any specific events I?ve seen on TV, but I remember the number of them and their variation. It struck me that what seemed likely was that we do have ET visitors, and not just a few. What rules they follow to stay so relatively unobserved, I have no idea. Perhaps they have a Visitor?s Association, some compact as to how to deal with Terra of Sol. Ground rules. I?m sorry, I?m teasing. But maybe they do have a Prime Directive of non-interference. Perhaps our over-steroided secret military is playing gags on us and having fun inventing variations on the ?craft? theme for chuckles. In what I observed, I don?t think the human race, in any secret laboratory, has yet produced any technology that could make an object move as I observed a particular UFO move. I only saw actual UFOs once (a total of nine craft), but may have had an earlier sighting at Crane Beach, which I?ll describe.

I tell you flatly that what I saw was no illusion and no trick of nature. It was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at roughly 3:30 AM, 12 January 1988*. I lived at the end of Dudley Street at the time, near the Arlington border and an eight-block hike from the end of the Red Line. It was the dead of night in Winter, absolutely, perfectly still and silent, with a thick covering of snow over everything. The sky was clear and dark as it could be being near Boston, the streetlights did little to interfere. The stars were out.

I was unemployed at the time so being up at 3:30 AM was usual. Even by January 12th I had not shut the storm windows and didn?t want the extra cold draft anymore, so I opened the inner window - I have to guess and am probably wrong but I think the window faced away from Boston, so a map should show the direction of my view. I couldn?t get the storm window to close from the inside, so I leaned out of the (third floor) window so that I could rotate to face the window to start closing it from the outside. I managed to face the window, but not at the angle I wanted to so I tried to ?unrotate? and try again, and in that moment something caught my attention, and I turned my head to see what it was.

I saw ?phosphorescent orange? things for a moment but had some impression of sparks to one side of my view, so I quickly looked for them to my left (remember I am looking upward at about a 45-degree angle - looking left was looking up at about 60-degrees.) By the time my gaze had shifted, the sky there was black, so I looked back for the orange impression and now I saw eight craft. It took me about 150 milliseconds to quit worrying that I was seeing UFOs and just look at them, because of course I had never seen them before and I wanted to see everything I could.

The eight craft were in a perfect formation, a sort of octagonal oval. Imagine a square, the four points of the square are four craft, and then at equal distances fore and aft the lead and tail pairs of craft are inset somewhat, making an ?oval?. They were, I?m guessing, roughly 150 feet off the ground and at first sight about one or two city blocks away. They were gliding absolutely smoothly and noiselessly - no sound reached me. I would estimate their air speed as about 20 mph - not fast. At first sight I was able to see them in some relief (their sides as well as their bottoms.) I?m sorry to disappoint you, but they in fact looked like a classical Hollywood flying saucer**, more or less. I recall a dome shape atop; I don?t recall whether there were or weren?t seams between the dome portion and the rest. Dome-to-side came down curving, and it seemed there was the classical ?skirt? flange along the bottom edge of the craft, that ?foil? at the bottom edge familiar from movies. The craft themselves (their undersides) were of a similar oval shape (the phrase ?horseshoe crab? wishes I would use it.) They appeared to have flat bottoms with a particular lighting; the spectacular thing about these craft was their color and light; they ?glowed? softly, as if luminescent/phosphorescent, a particular color which I describe as ?salmon orange?. The light came from every part of the craft, but there was no apparent ?reason? they should seem bathed in the light that I could see. The bottom sides of the craft had a thick annulus of a darker orange color meeting the outer edge, and spaced at intervals within the annulus all around were dark squares. For some reason I assumed those had to do with levitation and propulsion. In the center of the bottom, enclosed by the annulus, the color was again as bright as on the outside.

In the time it took to observe these details, the craft had closed the distance to my house by half and I could only observe the undersides of the craft. Then something again caught my attention ?out of the corner of my eye? to my left, and I turned quickly to see what it was. This time it took a moment to see what was happening, and my jaw dropped. An object - smaller than the other craft, more spherically symmetrical, almost cubic but impossible to tell, lit more strongly than the others with the same color light, was making short excursions in free space that appeared to violate the laws of conservation of momentum. It zipped. I could follow its movements but it was exceedingly fast. It appeared to be even closer to me at one point, perhaps 80 feet above, but it zipped off - always in straight lines - at crazy and acute angles from its previous direction - instantaneously. And it did this at a rate of two to three times per second. I?ll estimate that the straight-line paths were 50 to 100 feet in length. This thing moved as if it were a bullet ricocheting inside a steel-walled chamber, but it was doing this in free space, in three dimensions. I had the chance to observe about 7-10 such cycles before it passed out of view over my house, and still astonished I wheeled back to catch the others but they passed overhead and out of view in a few more seconds. I wasted several seconds fussing with the window to get it closed, and then I raced to the front of the house to the veranda but there was no sign of them on what I thought might be their path. Chickenshit that I was (how many people get to see UFOs?), and living on the third floor with no shoes or socks on in the dead of Winter, I regret that I did not just run downstairs and outdoors, snow be damned and look for them. I think I rationalized at the time that I had seen them in any case, so not seeing more of them was not going to erase that I had now seen them.

I think the ?sparks? I first thought I saw was this ninth craft, that when I tried to see the ?sparks? the craft had simply been blocked from view by the house. I remember the sense of confusion in my visual cortex as to what to look at, and I think this craft was what actually drew my attention to begin with, even though it initially passed out of view almost immediately. I got the impression that this ninth craft was some sort of scout for the other craft, a lookout. I wondered that they came at all, coming when they did means everyone?s asleep - and not a soul was stirring that night (in that neighborhood) but me. I wondered if they detected my presence or observation - if it mattered to them, whether they had taken notice and made any changes to escape observation. It seemed to me they deviated their course because they did not emerge on the other side of the house where I thought they should (see Figure 1.) They would have to have changed course 15 or more degrees, based on where I didn?t see them.

Oh well, that one time. Except for Crane Beach. A few weeks before this sighting, in my Noir mood being depressed and unemployed, I went to Crane Beach - I?d gone once before. I always took binoculars, I had a spectacular 7?50 that I could see the moons of Jupiter with (try that! It?ll rock your world.) Again it was the dead, dead of night (probably in the same time frame, between 0315 and 0400), nobody around, nice and spooky, at the water?s edge, the Atlantic. I was there for a while looking at stars. The sky was very clear. Finally I got a little restless to get going, watched a few jets, and then saw another ?jet? - but this one was interesting. It was brighter than the other planes but it was colored, whereas the other jets all used white lights, this one was - slightly reddish orange. The same color as the later UFOs. I thought that was curious and I followed it, and then another thing struck me: this thing appeared to be miles and miles out to sea, yet it was traveling really fast across the horizon proceeding South, which meant that its objective speed had to be even faster. It was much faster than the lazy jets nearing Boston. There is a spit of land (Rockport) ?south? of Crane Beach (Figure 2.) Against the 2D backdrop of the coastline with the spit in the ?upper right? (Figure 3), the object seemed to near the spit and then made a change of path - which astonished me because it was almost exactly orthogonal to its original path. It didn?t bat an eyelash or change its speed in any way but it executed a 90-degree turn instantaneously (like the cars hitting corners in ?Tron?) and proceeded in a direction that now took it away from the spit and out to sea. I remember thinking about it at the time, if I had really seen that object do what it had seemed to do. I gave up, and chalked it to memory. That memory was awakened shortly after the direct UFO sighting; if these UFOs could do it, so could that thing, whatever it was. Whatever it was at Crane Beach was much larger than what I saw in Cambridge.

I would like to see them again.

* I made certain to memorize the date. The time may be off a bit.

** There are ?two kinds? of hollywood flying saucer. One has a hemispherical dome atop in the center of a wide circular disk, whose surface is mostly parallel to the ground - a plate. This is probably the more ?modern? idea once designers got into it. The other kind has more superstructure or ?cabin? above, whose sides are more upright. My kind was the second kind. I am reminded of the CSS Virginia (aka the Merrimack), with the beveled sides.

Figure 1: location of direct sighting. I walked home from Alewife station. The red line shows their path, however once they crossed the black dot representing my house, I lost sight of them. You can see why I thought I should be able to see them from the front side of the house. The number ?one? or what looks like an exclamation point on the red line is where the craft were when I first saw them.

Figure 2. Crane Beach, the location of the first sighting.

Figure 3. My attempt to depict the view from Crane Beach as seen by an observer on the shore. Bad job, but you see the ?spit? at the ?upper right?. The orange line shows the path of the craft, including the 90-degree turn, but I?m too poor with The Gimp to give a correct impression how far out to sea the ?orange path? is or how much distance on the horizon the craft covered.

Well I guess its your basic "" I was driving down the road story"". I was coming back from mountainburg and was already in chester. I was heading ""west"" on old crossroads when I noticed a flash in the sky. My first thought was ""wow, that plane is flying low"". 

Then when I looked back up I seen it was making a sharp curve just above the trees. I realized then that no plane can fly that way. So I did a u-turn and went to a spot close by where I knew I could pull off the road. I got out of the car and stood in the road watching this object. It was flying and making curves that a plane could never make. It would then straighten up and fly normal. Then it would slow down and wiggle from side to side. It did both the curving maneuvers and wiggling a few times. It seemed to move more of my way so I was able to get a good look. There is really nothing to explain cause it was very plain looking. It was oval shaped. Toward the edges of this object it got thin. Meaning it was alot thicker in the middle then the edges. There was no markings or windows. It didnt make a sound. But what I consider the most fascinating was the color. It was the most shiny silver color I have ever seen. It was amazing how the sun reflected from this object. I want to say it looked like a piece of polished sterling silver, but it was more shiny then silver. I can honestly say I have never seen such a brilliant piece of metal before. I literally had to shield my eyes from the glare. After it did its funny flying and wiggling a few times it slowed down again. I figured it was going to wiggle like it already had several times. But instead it took off like a bullet. It was so fast I cant even explain how fast it was! It took off in a northwest direction over the top of a mountain. It was still just above the tree line when it took off. It wasnt a large object. As a matter of fact it was rather small.

I am a 20-year-old undergraduate student of a California state University studying physics.  On the 24th of October, 2008 I and two friends were driving back to our hotel in Pismo Beach, California on California highway 101 southbound about 6 miles north of the town of Pismo Beach.  At 7:29 PM, a bright orange light arose from behind a hill ahead SSE of our position.  It initially put me in mind of a helicopter pointing a searchlight directly at us because of the intensity of the light.  After about 20 seconds of  watching and guessing as to the nature of said light, I pulled out my cell phone (while driving, so the video is not only poor, but shaky) and filmed a short video.  The light dimmed as it rose making me initially think it was a flare, so I watched for telltale signs.  It did not seem to accelerate (as a non-propelled projectile at -9.8 m/s^2), it seemed to be rising at a constant velocity.  I was unable to watch it with the attention it deserved until I was able to pull off the highway at the next exit.  So the next paragraph will be the event as described by the passenger sitting in the rear right seat between its initial rise into the air to the time we were able to get out of the car.

My friend driving the car pointed out a flying object ahead of us. It seemed to be to close to be an airplane and didn?t look like one either. We traced it as it seemed to get farther away from us until it was just visibly the size of a bight star. We kept our eyes on it as we pulled off the highway, there we watched it for another minute or so before it abruptly disappeared.

I was taking quick glances up at the light as it rose higher and became dimmer and more angled.  The light seemed to be becoming more triangular (isosceles with the most acute angle seemingly pointing northwest).  It seemed to be traveling more westward over the ocean.  Eventually the light became a single point and was only distinguishable from the stars around it because it still had the characteristic orange color that it had when it first came into view over the nearby hill.  We pulled the car off the freeway at around 7:32 PM, immediately parked and got out of the car to pay full attention (we think it was Spyglass Drive, but we weren?t focused on the name of the exit at the time).  The light was suspended in the same position from our perspective and compared to its original size was at least a factor of 4 or 5 times its initial distance from us (just a size ratio and some simple trigonometry).  And that being the case, I?m able to determine that it was not descending (unless moving towards me simultaneously, which is easily verified by intuition or vector analysis).  That being the case, the light remained at the same intensity as we discussed what it could possibly be.  I was looking very closely and it seemed that it was getting slightly brighter.  But just about as soon as I made that realization, the light ?turned off?.  It looked like it either burned out or went very quickly away from us.  I started writing this record of the event at about 7:50 PM and have now finished it at 8:58 PM, making sure to be as clear and accurate as I possibly can.

As a side note, I just had a friend read this just a few minutes after I finished writing it.  He was driving another vehicle with another of our friends with him.  The report from them is they saw it as well and one reports seeing another similar ?object? in the northwest direction during the event described above.","Student/Sales",5,1,"changing",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2008,2000,4,10,19,"Evening","West",0,1,0,0,0

Side note, I was a stinger missile gunner in the Army and ever since then, I have a habit of looking in the sky/air.  I was trained to look and observe and identify aircraft.  Since then, I tend to look upward often and try to challenge myself to identify aircraft whenever possible.

This day however had a very high overcast.  I would guess 5-10 thousand feet.  We were  in her Mothers front yard playing with the dogs.  I happened to look up and noticed  a single sphere silhouetted against the backdrop of the overcast skyline.  I quickly called for my girlfriend to come over and see it as well.  As we stood there watching the ONE sphere/round object silhouette against the background of the overcast sky, suddenly a second sphere/round object appeared, then an other sphere/round object, then finally a fourth.   All were perfectly aligned and all where exact same size/symmetric.  Within less than one minute they suddenly simply streaked off or more accurately, just disappeared.

This is what the looked like once all four came together: (although they almost perfectly blended in with the skyline/clouds).  I?m simply trying to point out the symmetry and alignment of the way they appeared.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, I was stationed at Ramey Air Force Base. It housed KC-135 tankers, B-52 and U-2 hangars, and 8 nuclear storage bunkers with 500 pound bombs. I held a top secret clearance; I was a member of the Combat Defense Force and Sentry Dog Handler.

We were working twelve hour shifts during the crisis, it was near relief time when I looked out towards the sunrise, off into the calm, blue, orange sky and saw something strange. There was one small cloud with flashing lights moving inside of it, and he cloud was moving towards the no-fly-area.\ We K-9 units wanted to know what it was. We took a truck across the runway to the flight crews Quarters. Everyone was looking at the cloud as it slowly approached, making no noise, red, blue, yellow lights revolved inside the bubbling, boiling cloud like a carousel. It was now 30 feet above the ground and it seemed to be roughly 20 feet deep.

While staring at this spectacular object, I sincerely hoped no one would fire on it because we were all armed at the time.

I went off duty for three days and came back to silence. Nobody talked about it. And nobody told me not to talk about it; except my mother. A strike on our facility would have been even more catastrophic for the United States than an attack on the east coast from Russia or Cuba.

First of all, I was a skeptic?s skeptic.  My father and three relatives were on their way to a lodge meeting one Monday evening in 1947, near Lewistown, Montana.  Dad was excited as could be the next day relating how they saw the lights of the ""flying saucer"" (I?d never heard the term UFO at that time.) and they pulled the car into an approach, shut it off and all got out to observe the gyrations these lights were performing, close by--and without a sound.  

I was thoroughly embarrassed for Dad, his two brothers and nephew, and didn?t relate the incident to ANYONE.  That is until some years later, when strange things were happening near Great Falls, when a TV newsman caught several UFOs circling around Great Falls; and later incidents at Minuteman Missile sights in central Montana.

I believe the year was 1990 or 1991.  I don?t remember but it likely late spring to early summertime.  I went to the ""coffee shop"" near the viaduct in Whitefish, where I met the retired GNRY workers I enjoyed having coffee with, and listening to their stories of ""steam railroad"" in years past.  I was sitting with three GNRY retirees.  I was facing Big Mountain, the local ski resort.

I observed a very shiny (shinier than chrome) ""airplane"" coming into sight above Big Mountain, approximately 15 miles from where we sat.  (I used to have a friend who owned an old 140 Cessna aircraft, which he used to polish and buff.)  Since it was confusing to me, I mentioned to the three others at our booth, ""I see a UFO flying toward Whitefish.""  I was kind of kidding, but it soon proved quite true.  By this time it was probably about 5 miles?   We watched the ""airplane"" descending and the closer it got, it was obvious at the slow cautious speed it traveled, that it was no ""Cessna aircraft,"" but rather a very thin disk.  (It appeared as though one took two ""cymbals"" and placed one atop the other, it would replicate the shape we were seeing.  There was slightly more ""cabin"" underneath than on top.)   I would estimate the width of the total craft to be 75? in width.

I went to the kitchen and told the owner and his wife we were observing a UFO nearing Whitefish.  The 6 of us went outside to watch this situation.  The UFO came to a stop about ? of a mile from us, hovering above (best guess?) Wisconsin Avenue or the east edge of Whitefish Lake when it began hovering about 250-300 feet above the ground.  We observed it in a noiseless, standstill hover for approximately 5 minutes.  Then it took off in a northeast direction, although approximately straight up.  I?d estimate it was out of Earth?s atmosphere in less than five seconds.

Sadly the three GNRY retirees have passed away.  The restaurant owner and his ex-wife are still living.  We discuss that day every time I see him.  The incident was reported in the main Kalispell newspaper the next day on the front page.  

Now that I?m retired, I plan to go to the Montana Historical Society and go through those years of newspapers on videotape and try to find that story for my own satisfaction; now that I have to defend my status as a former skeptic.

To whom it may concern, Yes I am writing this in concern of the matter of a U.F.O. that was sighted by myself and my current girlfriend  on 1/8/09 (last night) at approxamately 6:30pm-6:45pm wile traveling north on hwy.  6 just a fourth of a mile before hwy. 302 in Lexington County, SC.  I was in the passanger seat when I noticed to my right above the treeline a good half mile off the road we were on a brightly luminated object that was the color red when I first noticed it and to me it looked like it had risin up out of the wooded area and came to a rest or hover just above treeline and that is when I told my girlfriend to ""pull over"" and ""look at that"" at that time the object had started to move vertical very slowly but when it started to move upward the object did something strange it changes size, and color. From a bright red to a green,orange,purple then blue. From where we were the object seemed to be a sphere and kept a spherical shape even as it changed size and color but when I first seen the object as I stated it was a bright red and  I guess then it was about the size of a dime on the horrizon but when changed to green it got smaller to about half the size of a dime then it went to a amber-orange color it expanded to about the size of a half dollar on the horrizon then it turned to a brilliant violet-purple and it went to the smallest size witch was about the size of a BB then the last color was again a very beautiful brilliant blue and then was just a little bigger than the BB sized purple and that was what it looked like as it went up through the clouds the color was so bright that as it went through the clouds it also lit up the surrounding clouds. But as it was moving upward and changing colors and size it made a few really fast zig-zag moves then went straight up through the clouds. All of this sighting happend in a matter of 45 seconds to a minuite after pulling the car of the road.

But what I think is really strange and you will too is that in 1992-93 me my father and my sister whitnessed an object exactly like the one I saw last night. And it was very near the same place just back in 92-93 my family and I saw it from a different location witch was on Fish Hatchery Rd. in Gaston,SC  but a good mile from my then home the object hovered and changed size and color but what is interesting is that then it was over a area that is the Lexington County Lanfill and when we saw the object last night it was over the same landfill my girlfriend and I were just on the hwy 6 side of it but back in 92-93 my family and I were exact oppisite on Fish Hatchery Rd. side.

Now there have been for years talk in the community that there may be Millitary Weapon Sylos on the Landfill complex witch I guess is about ten miles squared in a heavily wooded area. I really do not know if there may be missiles or nukes or any other thing there that anyone or anything may find interesting on this landfill property but I know what I saw and this is the second time I have saw it above this area and whatever it was it must have been interested in something there. Both times I got this feeling that whatever this thing was intelligance was there. I was 13 at the time of the first sighting with my father and sister and I am 29 now and I just hope I am  lucky enough to whitness something that intelligent and beautifull again before I die. Also I would like to add these two times I whitnessed a UFO were the only time in my life I had ever seen something unexplainable in the skies of SC or anywhere else in the USA.

Was driving from Clifton Forge to Covington, Va. on I-64 W after getting off work and going to the grocery store.

 Weather was overcast, just before a winter storm warning, with low, solid clouds, cold temperatures, and poor visibility. Sky was fully darkened.

 Was driving due west on I-64 when I observed from the far left, an aircraft of some kind, which flew from left to right (very south to very north) over the interstate. The aircraft was approximately the same size as a typical fighter aircraft, but didn't have running lights. First off, there were no flashing lights at all (required by FAA), and also no solid wingtip lights, if there were any wings. Second, the aircraft had a distinctly large, bright, diffuse aft glow, orange to peach in color, oval in shape like a figure ""8"" laid on its side but not that precise. This gave the impression of what might be jet engines, but it didn't seem as bright or cherry-red as engines, and was more large and amorphous, less like two distinct circles, like you'd observe on a fighter aircraft at night. Also, there was a fore end glow, rather large but smaller than the aft end glow, also peach or orange in color but less bright, and either pointed-oval or cone-shaped, like a cockpit with the light on. It gave the impression of a structured craft with a general shape of a high aspect ratio cone, but the glowing features were not bright enough to illuminate wings or a fuselage of any kind.

 The aircraft flew approximately over Alleghany Regional Hospital, perpendicular to the interstate, over the interstate, until it reached Valley Ridge Road in front of Alleghany High School, where it took a sharp turn westward, to follow Valey Ridge Road. It cut the turn rather abruptly, kind of ""skidding"" through the air and wobbling from left to right a couple of times to overcorrect its path to a straight line before proceeding due west to the right of I-64 along Valley Ridge Road toward Covington, where I lost it. When it cut the right-angle turn, the glow seemed to brighten, but that could have just been me getting a straight-on look at it's aft section.

 What struck me was how low, large, fast and maneuverable it was. There is a mountain behind the high school, can't be more than 1,500 feet high. I saw this thing silhouetted against that mountain as it flew off, so it was definitely lower than the ridge. It looked like it had to hand a fast left to avoid smacking into the ridge. Approximately the size of a large jet fighter only larger, and very fast and maneuverable... I'd say the whole sighting lasted maybe 5-7 seconds. There had to be lots of people who saw this, it was over the interstate at a very busy time.

 This could be related to some daylight sightings of Osprey aircraft operating in Lexington a few weeks ago. Could this have been an Osprey at night? I don't know. Somehow I don't think so, because if you saw this thing move, it moved more like a cruise missile or sophisticated UAV or something. Also, there was NO (and I mean absoluted ZERO) sound at all coming from this thing. That produced an eerie effect. After I lost it, I looked at my car radio and marked the time as 6:41 PM.

 Anyone else who saw this, I'd appreciate your views. Thanks.

While attending a family Thanksgiving in Los Angeles, CA, our family had booked several rooms at the Four Seasons Hotel on Doheny Blvd, near Beverly Hills. Our room was on the 5th floor. Since our room was in the middle of the hotel it became the meeting place for everyone.

The first morning we were there, which was November 26 at about 9 am the room began to shake ever so slightly. We turned on the TV to find that there was a 5.4 earthquake.  We were delighted to have a great story to tell when we got home back to Texas. What happened next, paled in comparison to the earthquake.

The last night we were there, Saturday November 28, 1992, we ate out and those of us staying at the hotel came back to pack for Sunday?s departure back to our respective homes across the country.  My husband and children went to sleep around 9:30.

My two nephews who had other rooms at the same hotel, came to our room to visit.  The room was sort of a one bedroom suite with a separate living area that had a balcony. We went to the balcony at 10:30, I remember because I checked the time and checked on my family who were all asleep.

I was on the balcony with my two nephews ( aged 24 and 26) we could see the layout of the area below which was like a courtyard where people were sitting at tables and walking around. We chatted and enjoyed people watching as well.

All of a sudden, as if someone on the roof had thrown it, I saw what appeared to be a football shaped object bright white light come down in an arc (it did not fall straight down, it arched from the roof to in front of us) to eye level where it seemed to hover in front of us. I happened to be looking up at the sky or roof when it first appeared so I saw it from the get go.

I remember one nephew saying, ""What is that?""  The light or whatever it was hovered in front of us for what seemed to be a few seconds then took off like a bullet horizontally and as it did so, it changed color from bright white light to a neon green, with the green advancing from the front to the rear of the object as it changed color, it disappeared into the darkness.

Suddenly, we realized it was 3:00 AM, we were sort of surprised that the time flew by, they left to their rooms and we all went right to sleep.

The next morning, we gathered our things said our goodbyes and headed to the airport. While on the plane to Dallas, I suddenly remembered and told my husband, ""We saw a UFO or something.""  He was quite amazed and had me tell him the whole story.  He found it significant that neither of the nephews had mentioned it, and I had not remembered it when we were all together that morning.

My eyes started bothering me beginning that day on the plane ride home. I was seeing spots in front of my eyes like you see after flash photography. I assumed it would go away. By Monday, I was trying to get in touch with my nephews to see what or if they were experiencing something. The younger of the two told his mother who told me that in the night of the sighting, he had a bad nightmare that something had him tied down to a table and was trying to hurt him  By Thursday of the same week, my eyes were somewhat better, but the spots were still there. So, I went to the eye Dr. He checked and said that I had damage similar to an arc welders burn at the back part of the inside of my eye. He asked if I had been near anyone while they were welding. I told him no, not at all. He said the spots would go away in a few more days and they eventually did.

When I was finally able to speak to my nephews about our experience, neither really wanted to discuss it other than to say it was the strangest thing they?d ever seen.  Neither of them could understand why it was 10:30 then 3:00 and why time flew by, furthermore none of us could understand why we all seemed to forget about it completely until I remembered. The nephew that had the nighmare said he didn?t want to talk about it, so I dropped it.

Page 2 UFO Experience cont?d.

I became obsessed with this experience.  Since the Internet was not available at the time, I went to the Dallas Public Library. I asked the Librarian how to report a UFO. She turned to a reference book, and gave me two names.  The first of which was in Phoenix, AZ. To this day, I cannot remember the man?s name. I called him and he took down the incident.  He may have had me make a drawing and mail it or fax it to him.

He had the oddest monotone voice, very deep but without emotion or inflection.  He assured me he would look into it.  A few weeks later, he called me and told me that he went to the Four Seasons, he actually stayed in our room (back then I knew the room number and gave it to him-now I can only remember 5th floor) he said that in daylight, the direction at which the bright white object that turned green went on the horizontal level would have taken it into a shopping mall on Robertson Blvd. He said that was not logical.

Furthermore, he said that green lights are a phenomenon that occurs around earthquakes and have nothing to do with UFO?s.   His conclusion was that what we saw were those lights.

Obviously, I forgot this man?s name because he did not tell me what I wanted to hear.  He did not validate what we knew we saw, a UFO.  We knew it was a UFO and have known all this time. He had no explanation as to why the object changed color from white to green as it went horizontal and shot off faster than I can type it.

We know what we saw was a UFO.  We were not UFO buffs at the time.  This thing or even seeing it was the farthest thing from our minds.  What I do know is this thing to me was real. It was an experience I will never forget, and it opened my mind to the fact that we are not alone.

As a sidebar to this experience, when I took the film from our California trip to be developed the girl that was working at the photo shop asked me who was my trip.  Well, I told her all about the UFO. She told me that on her way to work a week earlier she saw a diamond shaped UFO which seemed to follow her from Plano, Texas, (along FM 544) to Carrollton, Texas, which is where the photo processing store was. Not just her, but suddenly I found out I knew other people who had seen UFO?s right here in our area.

Sunday, February 1, 2009 Sonoma County, California 38 degrees, 20?, 47? N 122 degrees, 41?, 54? W  

At approximately 7:30 pm PST, I witnessed a strange light in the western sky approximately 35 degrees up from the western horizon west southwest from my position.  At first I thought it to be the planet Venus (as I am accustomed to seeing this planet in the sky at around this time of night during this season) but it was very reddish in appearance. 

I then spotted Venus off to the right and lower in the sky than the object in question. I then went into the house to get my binoculars to have a closer look.

After retrieving my binoculars, I looked again and the object began to emit what appeared to be flare-like objects which were the same color as the object and they drifted downward, appearing to be affected by gravity but had some velocity to them as well. I could not resolve the object any better with my binoculars than I could with the naked eye. I could not see any detail besides the color which was an orange-red.

Finally the object began to wane and then it would come back brighter then wane again. Finally it disappeared altogether. During the episode, the object did not appear to move across the sky, but remained stationary. A neighbor saw it as did my daughter-in-law. The neighbor said he saw it change position in the sky but did not think it to be an aircraft as it moved very slowly.

When I first saw it, I thought it was Venus. Then I thought it might be a distant star undergoing some sort of change but when the flare-like objects started to emit from it I was reminded of a combat aircraft dropping flares to avoid heat-seeking missiles. However, there were only about six flare-like objects released from the main body of the object, and they were not brighter but rather they were the same color and brightness as the main object. There were no flashing lights or different color lights. The only change in appearance that I witnessed was the eventual fading of the object and the reappearance of the object only to fade again and finally disappear for good.","Dispensing Optician",3,7,"sphere",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2009,2000,1,2,19,"Evening","West",0,1,0,0,0

During this initial observation the object never came closer or farther in respect to our viewing location; basically the object size never changed.  Orion?s belt was viewed almost due West at approximately 11 o?clock position from our viewing position. We heard no noise or saw no indication of a missile launch out of Vandenburg Air Force Base; next launch is scheduled for February 24, 2009 per Vandenburg?s calendar.  The object was than observed through the side sighting scope of an amateur telescope (D: 60mm; F: 700mm) where the following was observed: object had a dark center, with a white band with red and blue colors radiating outward from the white outer band perimeter. Object remained a full round shape 90% of the time.  However, it changed from that frontal view round shape and rotated on its vertical axis maintaining same vertical size, but it changed its? vertical shape to half the original frontal view; then its? shape shifted like a saucer rounded on one edge and flat on the other edge; then it rotated and titled some more and its? shape became an oval and went into a horizontal position. Within 30-45 seconds after changing to that final position the object descended below the visible horizon.  The color lights remained the same throughout this observation.  The view through the main telescope was further validated by one of the observers.  One observer; having worked on highly secretive military aircraft; and that observer understands the maneuverability of aircraft; believes these observations are beyond any known comprehensible understanding of present day aircraft to his knowledge.

In the winter of 1979,  I was in  A.I.T. at Ft. Jackson S.C.  A-12-4.

I and another soldier were on guard duty at an ammo dump. I was walking ten paces ahead of him (according the rules of patrolling) on the left side of the raised dump mound, as we both became aware of a light flashing in the sky.  It was lighting up the whole area, and seemed to be happening in regular intervals, about 15 seconds apart.  After a few flashes, although I couldn't tell of its origin, I could somehow sense the direction from which it came.  I sped up my pace to get to the far end of the mound, so I could better see where it was coming from.  When I got to the end of the  mound, I looked up at the sky in that direction.  It was a beautiful clear night, you could see forever, but one star seemed to stand out.  It seemed to have a bit of a green tint to it, otherwise it looked like all the other stars.  Then it flashed. I can only describe it as looking like a giant flash cube.  It lit up the whole area. Then it turned red and streaked across the sky, within a second it was out of sight.

I freaked out, not being able to believe what I had just witnesed.  The soldier who was behind me didn't see it take off but he saw my reaction to it.  By that time ""to hell with the rules"" we were walking side by side like a couple of scared little kids, as I was telling him what I saw in every detail, when the area lit up again.  We stood there breathless, crouched down watching this thing do just as it had done before.  It lit up the entire area about 5 or 6 times in about 15 second intervals, turned red and streaked back across the sky, gone in a second.

Another soldier who was in the guard shack saw the flashing but didn't see where it came from.

We did report the incident, but it wasn't taken seriously, we were laughed at.

The 1st duty station I was assigned to after training happened to be on a missile range. I was privy to see at that time what was the fastest flying missiles in the US Arsenal. Nothing I ever saw could even compair to what we saw that day in South Carolina.

I had this experience as an 11 or 12 year old child, but I have always remembered it precisely.  I have long thought that I should submit a record of this to someone who would add it to the data on this topic, and I am finally doing it.

Let me preface by saying that through the years, I have observed several objects that people who were with me at the time thought were UFO?s, but I knew they weren?t because I knew what they were.  One was a weather balloon, one a jetliner near the airport (when they have their landing light on at sunset, it is a striking sight), one a meteor close enough to hear the roar and light up the night sky and one a military missile in an inexplicable location.  However, the one sighting I can?t explain was the least visually striking.  I say all this to demonstrate that I have a decent amount of knowledge in explaining explainable sightings.

One soft summer night which I believe was 1963, but may possibly have been 1962, my father, my three sisters and I went out on the patio to watch the Perseid meteor shower.  It was sometime in August.  We had a rollaway bed out there, and we all lay down on it sideways and side by side with each other.  We scanned the sky for shooting stars, which appeared at the rate of about one per minute.

One of my sisters said, ?look, two stars are colliding!?  We all looked where she indicated, and indeed, you could see two stars moving toward each other.  As we watched, they did, in fact, meet and merge into one, only to separate again after a few seconds.  After that, everyone else went back to looking for shooting stars, but I kept observing this phenomenon.  After a couple of minutes, I realized that only one of the two stars was in motion.  It kept moving on its steady path, and I kept watching.

My first thought was that it was a satellite.  Some months earlier, forewarned by a news broadcast, we had gone out to watch one of the early manmade satellites pass overhead.  It looked just like a moving star.  I suppose it reflected light from the sun, which enabled us to see it.  It had a steady progression across the sky and kept a fairly steady level of brightness.  After ten minutes or so, I realized it couldn?t be an orbiting satellite.  I noticed its apparent path across the sky was noticeably slowing.  I kept watching, and the next thing I noticed was that it was dimming.  I kept watching for perhaps half an hour, and it gradually slowed until it was essentially motionless in the sky, and it gradually dimmed until finally, it slowly became impossible to make out.  At first sight, it had the appearance of a medium to medium bright star.

It was clearly not a satellite or a meteor.  The only scenario I?ve ever been able to think of that matches my observation is that of a space ship in the process of leaving Earth?s orbit.  In 1963, we had no space ships which left Earth?s orbit.  What I saw was truly an unexplained flying object.

I would be glad to answer any questions concerning this.

I was eating a meal outside of whole foods market when i saw a very large ball shaped object, that looked similar to a star at first; however, it seemed too bright for it to be a star.  It stayed stationary for about five minutes, while my girlfriend and I observed it.  It didn't look like a star or a plane after about five minutes.  It then too the shape of a very long cigar shaped object.  I thought it might be a test missile or a test airplane because the surrounding area of Las Vegas has a lot of Testing Facilities; however, this now cigar looking object did not look like a jet stream or a plane or anything of that sort. 

The tips of the cigar shape were very bright and the oject continued to remain stationary as it transformed from a large star looking object into a cigar shape;

I am writing to describe an anomalous sighting of an aircraft that I witnessed alone last night.  I live in a condo on Butler Beach very near Saint Augustine Beach and the ancient city of Saint Augustine.  Very often I take a 4 mile walk on the beach in the evenings.

Last night, Friday April 3, 2009, I left my house at approximately 9:00 PM (I did not wear a watch) and I walked south down the beach from Dondanville Road to Mary Street (2 miles) where I turned around and was approximately one half mile north of the Matanzas Street beach ramp (I estimate it was between 9:35 and 9:45 PM).  I was noticing the bright moon nearly directly overhead casting a short shadow as I walked and I turned around and looked up to admire it.  A bright banana yellow object caught my eye?it was far off in the distance (low on the horizon)but increased by double in size in just about 15 seconds?it still was very far off and at first looked like it might be an airplane (except for the unusual color).  After 15 seconds it looked more like a Coast Guard Helicopter with a search light on and it was much closer (I am estimating 3-4 miles away).

I took my headphones off to listen but heard nothing.  The yellow light continued parallel to the beach and I looked very carefully to see the green and white flashing lights of an airplane to appear ? which they did not.  When I first saw the light it was low on the horizon and seemed to have a contrail.  I thought maybe it was a space shuttle launch or a missile.  But then it kept getting closer and larger and was not climbing higher.  It did not seem to leave any further contrails after I saw it?it was like it might have been after a vertical climb.

I am sorry but I am completely unable to surmise its size.  I had nothing to compare it to out over the water?but at its largest it would have been about 10% of a full moon (low on the horizon rising) at its closest to me -- I am estimating that to be a quarter mile to as far as a half a mile away.  I know that is no help.  I held my arm out and my thumb completely covered it and would have even if it had been four times larger.  The light continued towards me and parallel to the beach but and one point it turned directly to me and glowed very brightly, again in that banana yellow.  It grew larger and seemed to be moving very fast ? about the size of a softball, held at my arms length ? now dwarfing my thumb.  The light became so bright that it illuminated the water like a ray of sunshine?but again in that bright yellow?very similar to a ray of sunshine ? not diffused at all.  At that point I felt that it must be a helicopter but none the less I felt a little scared.

The light shifted slowly away from heading towards the beach (and me) to directly out to the ocean.  As it turned it looked half yellow and half orange with a fire-like flickering.  Finally it turned all orange and sped off impossibly fast due east and then grew very orange and doubled in size and then completely disappeared after a thunder-like orange flash?and the atmosphere looking all wavy like a heat distortion around where the light was.  I continued to watch for five minutes.  I looked all around the beach and saw no one else nearby.  I have no idea what it was I saw but I am very interested in knowing if anyone else saw it.",NA,1,1,"sphere",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2009,2000,2,4,21,"Evening","South",0,1,0,0,0

Monday approx 2:04 pm I was watching the space shuttle launch with the aid of a telescope.  It looked like a normal launch like the many I?ve watched before except on this occasion I noticed a irregular object in the same vicinity of the shuttle just as the shuttle went out of view.  To the naked eye it looked cigarette shaped and was moving rapidly to from West to East.  As I focused on the object it appeared to be cylinder shaped and was moving horizontally.  I did notice what appeared to be fins towards the aft of the object but it was not identifiable to any aircraft I have seen before.  I short it looked like a missile (no wings mid ship) flying horizontally at a very fast rate of speed.  I've watched airliners before thru a telescope and compare the rate of speed to be far faster than a commercial aircraft.  There was no vapor trail or any sign of exhaust.  I'm not saying this was extraterrestrial but I have a good knowledge of aircraft military and commercial and have never seen anything like this before flying in the manner (horizontally) it was.

My friend called me to tell me to check out a U.F.O. in the sky to the east at 7:45 pm.  I went outside and saw what looked like 3 large white balloons grouped together. It seemed as though it was reflecting the light from the setting sun, but as the sun set the objects got brighter, a lot brighter. I also noticed that even with the light breeze, the objects were not moving.  I soon realized these were not balloons. There were no other stars out at this point and I started getting text messages from 4 other friends telling me to check out whatever it was in the sky.  As I was in my backyard looking and describing over the phone to my friend, I could see one large orb in the center with three other orbs around it, seeming to be attached. The outer orbs were changing location, but always remained equidistant from each other (triangular formation). The object was fairly close, less than 10 miles away. I could also see a faint glow or haze around the object. My friend who called me was on the other side of town and it appeared much smaller to him than it did to me. My neighbor was outside in his backyard so I called him over and we started watching it together. As we watched, the orb flashed pinpoints of white light around it. It then began flashing pinpoints of red light around it.  After a few more minutes the center orb began to dim and the flashing pin points of light stopped, then the outer three orbs turned red and got brighter, becoming the only visible lights. At this point my neighbor?s roommate came outside with his camera and took pictures.  While I was on the phone describing what I was seeing, a small flashing light shot out of the bottom and headed northwest towards Albuquerque.  I could see a faint contrail behind the orb. This light was only visible for about 10 seconds before it was out of sight. The main object still remained in its same location but began to dim again.  Once in a while I could see a small light appear next to it, but I had to look away from the main object! to see it.  Several times I also witnessed the object to move slightly to the side or slightly upward, but always returning to its original location. Over the course of an hour, it remained it the same position in the sky, getting dimmer whereas the stars started to become visible and got brighter.  After an hour and a half it was difficult to see and was dimmer than the stars, but remained in the same place in the sky.

I am sure there will be more reports, as I had 4 friends from different locations in town that all noticed it on there own and told me to check it out.  It was also nice to have my neighbor watch it with me as he was able to verify all the things I was seeing. As a side note, I found it interesting that it seemed to be directly above the NASA facility which is on the western side of the mountains from White Sands Missile Range.  I have seen other strange things in the sky before, but never have I seen something so clearly that remained in the same place for so long and have so many other witnesses.  I don?t have the pictures, but when zoomed in, it looked like 3 orbs in a triangular formation with the light stretching towards each other.  It resembled a hot air balloon but was clearly not.

I and three additional friends were on our way to New Hampshire for the weekend. I was sitting in the front passenger seat while my girl friend drove. The other two sat in the rear. The craft was traveling at extreme speeds so it was difficult to see any real detail. The best description I could give was something like a Tomahawk missile. I was a police officer in the Air Force for ten years and have a great deal of experience surrounding air craft. The craft traveled from right to left across the highway (US 93). The terrain dropped to my right and rose to the left. I was fortunate to see it as it approached. My girl friend witnessed it as it passed to her front and above. If it was not a Tomahawk, (which is what I could have sworn it was) I have no idea what it was. The size was difficult to determine again due to the speed, but the fact I witnessed it and judging from the road and surrounding area I would speculate it was the same size as a Tomahawk or larger, most likely larger (it is difficult to see a Tomahawk at full speed passing directly in front of you). I looked at my girlfriend and she at me. She said what he fuck was that? I did not want to poison her thought process and simply asked her what she saw. She thought she saw a missile and kept asking me why would a missile be going over the highway and where is going and so on. I explained I did not know any of that and told her maybe it was a test rocket or such. To this day it troubles me whatever it was. I have seen many craft public and secret and the fact it was traveling over a U.S. highway bothers me the most. Anyway this is first time I have ever participated in such a public forum. Due the current state of affairs in this area I felt compelled to share.

I was walking home from a movie one evening. I had just passed the Rubber Bowl on George Washington Blvd, in south east Akron, when the sky behind me lit-up. I thought someone had turned on the lights in the stadium, so I turned around to look.

Out of the night sky(from the north) came a bright object. It was in a shallow dive. At that moment it seemed to have slightly elongated ""wing tips"" and a very bright - whitish glow. It was silent, but I could definitely feel its presents in the sky above me. It slowed as it passed almost directly over head.(Perhaps 2,000 feet above me.) Then it picked up speed and climbed away at about a 45 degree - upward angle, going south. It was gone in less than half a minute and the sky became black again.

Estimated entry speed was + 600 mph. Over head speed was about 100 mph. And estimated exit speed accelerated from 100 mph to well over 1,000 mph before it was out of sight. Overall estimated distance that the object appeared visible was: Approach equals 3 miles. Over head about 1 mile. Departure probably 20 miles, before going totally out of sight.

I have seen meteors, artillery shells, tracer bullets, and all kinds of aircraft flying at night: And there has been nothing that I've ever seen that behaved like this object. Once over head, I could see that it was slightly curved all across the leading edge (from tip - to tip), and had two smaller curves meeting in the center, at the trailing edge. It had no distinguishable fuselage in the center. A guess at the size would be 100 feet tip to tip and 30 feet leading edge to trailing edge. It could have been 8 feet thick in the center area, but I only got a glimpse at that, as it was coming toward me and going away.

There was a lot of very bright light nearest the object. The light was longer and brighter span-wise. It was smooth, with no exterior features, lights or markings. I was not close enough to determine if it was made out of metal, ceramic or other substance, but its surface did have a bright white glow about it.

That's all I can tell you.

We were in a pub, outside late in the evening when my friend (who is a physicist, amateur astromoner) pats my shoulder and tells me to look up. There we saw this orange orb moving from a South to West direction at constant speed. It looked large but impossible to tell because we had no idea how far it was. At first we thought ""hey look...thats quite an odd satellite""  It would fade out over the horizon.

Even though we thought this was interesting, we didn't think much of it until 7 minutes later at 11 50 we saw another identical orange object, same direction, same speed. This happened again every few minutes until we saw 5, all of them orange.

We are extremely baffled.

I myself am a planespotter and amateur astronomer and I have been researching UFOs for a couple of years, and I can assure you that what we were looking at was not an airplane that I know of. We are just extremely baffled by this.

It was a mild clear night, with hardly any clouds when I stepped outside to have a cigarette. As I stood outside, I was facing North and noticed a bright light moving across the sky at somewhat fast speed relative to my position on the ground. The light caught my eye from the Western sky and moved from west to east. The light was bright, white and seemed to grow and diminish in intensity several times during my observation.

It's path seemed straight, made no noise, and bore no navigational lights. I had observed it's path as being approximately 20 degrees elevated from the horizon, and traveled a very approximate altitude of 10,000 feet. It may have been higher, but that would have meant the craft would have had to have been quite enormous. It's flight made it from the Western sky horizon to the Eastern Sky horizon until I lost sight of it behind some neighbours trees. The craft was just as illuminated whilst traveling from me; as it was approaching me. At that altitude, my best calculation of speed would have been several times the speed of sound. Yet no sonic booms or vapour trials were evident.

Incidentally, this is an exact duplicate sighting of the same craft I saw one night in Stewartown, Ontario with a number of multiple witnesses 6 years ago, one of which was a MUFON representative. It was an almost identical flight path, and characteristics as this sighting. I've ruled out any airplanes, test missile flights, or satellites/space station. This is truly an unidentified object traveling at great speed, and without any sound.","Inside Sales Professional, Auxiliary Policeman",1,1,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2009,2000,2,5,22,"Night",NA,0,1,0,1,0

On Wednesday June 10th 2009, while vacationing in NM from CA, a friend and I were traveling west from ROSWELL towards CHACO CANYON NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK via ALBUQUERQUE on US 70. That day, we decided to follow a route via US 380 West towards the town of SOCORRO, searching for any available lodging on route. After securing a room at a local motel in the town of CAPITAN, we decided to go for a ride later on after dinner and check out the stars that night by the desert. We had experienced some overcast weather earlier in the day and the skies had turned clear enough to do so by evening. Somewhere around 8:00 pm we found NM State 234 on our GPS, and we decided to head for awhile on this road eastbound (and towards ROSWELL in Lincoln County).

NM STATE 230 is a 2 way road which appeareed to be mostly used by local traffic during the day and not a very busy road at all in the night. There are no light poles to illuminate the way once you've entered the desert and sometime after dusk (between 8:45 PM and 9:10 PM) the night fell quickly, and eeringly dark. I engaged my vehicle's high beam lights in order to better see the road, road markers & reflectors, and also had to slow down sufficiently enough below the posted speed limits (45 & 50) in order to also avoid hitting any of the abundant indigenous wild life we encountered through out most of our entire trip that night. In the 2.5 hour ride we'd traveled on this road, no other vehicles were encountered in either direction (nor could any be seen at a far distance in the mostly flat landscape).

 Sometime around 9:00 PM we reached an area somewhere in between mile markers 41 & 42 on STATE 230, at which point we decided not to continue any further in that direction. After doing a U-turn to head back westbound, I parked the car just on the shoulder of the road at mile marker 41. I turned off the engine, radio and lights, and sat we sat inside the car talking with my friend in total darkness & silence. We commented on how dark it had gotten on that crisp, clear and moonless night (up to that point...the moon rose up later on around 10:05 or so). Our plan qas to get our vision aclimated to the dark, and then get out of the car and look up at the constellations.

 However, before we even got a chance to set a foot outside on the ground. At approximately 9:10 PM (and with barely a hint of western dusk light left on the horizon...the eastern skies were already dark & starry!), we both noticed an object about the size of a bayer aspirin traveling hurridly miles above in the skies. We couldn't make out it's shape or outline at all, as it had a very bright and steady glowing orange to reddish light. At first, I  thought it may have been either a lear jet, or military aircraft traveling typically in a straight path, with a north-east to east bound trajectory heading, at a 30 degree angle above both the barely visible horizon, and the distant western mountain range beyond.

 I am well familiar with many aircrafts used by our military, having served in both the: USMC & the USCG.  So it seemed something rather odd that this craft was traveling that at night with no other type of fuselage lights ""ON"", nor did it produce any familiar distant sounds, like those from a jet or rotor engines.

 I was just about to calmy say something to my friend, when at that very same moment he bursted out saying: ""What is that in the sky?""...""do you see it?"" No sooner did he asked... when suddenly the object disappeared,  vanishing in what we'd estimated to be 5-6 seconds. Then, suddenly it re-appeared again further along on the same path, at what seemed tome to be 2-3 clicks east of it's last position. Suddenly, the object cleanly splits into 2 (two) objects (each retaining its original orangish-reddish color light), both objects then travelled parallel to the other at first. Quickly separating or widening apart in a sort of an arc fashion, then suddenly both objects did something bizzare: each dove right into each other, rejoining and giving the appearance as if both lights had ""MELTED"" or morphed back into 1(one)single object---immediatelly after completing this ""maneuver"", it completely ""vanished"" into thin air and it did not reappear again anywhere in the skies.

 There was absolutely no sound or echo indicating an explosion or collision, there were no visible trails, or ""hot"" sparks/debris falling anywhere on the ground landscape, nor could we see any surface fire coming out of the desert landscape below at that distance thereafter, which would've indicated any sort of accident happening in the skies and over that part of the desert.

 My friend and I sat there for about 5-10 minutes both, perplexed and excited at what we'd seen. We asked ourselves a number of questions in an attempt to make sense of what we'd witnessed  (i.e.: was it fireworks?...was it a satellite?...could it have been spotlights...missiles?) but, we couldn't arrive at a rational answer on what we saw that night. The entire episode lasted approximately 30 seconds and although I had a digital camera with me, unfortunately I could not retrieve it out of it's case, and power it up quickly enough to capture the event in the limited time as it happened. Afterwards, we started the engine, and quickly got back on the road back to our motel.","Musician",2,1,"sphere",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2009,2000,2,6,21,"Evening","West",0,1,0,0,0

During the normal Independence day celebrations going on in my neighborhood, my 10 year daughter and I had seen what immediately looked like a firework of some sort way in the distance. However, it became apparent after a few seconds that this was no firework even though it had the glowing color of a yellow/orange fire because it was moving way too slowly. The movement from our vantage point first moved from right to left fairly slowly which seemed like it could have been an airplane. However, after about 30 seconds of this right to left slow movement the object was still for about 10 to 15 seconds. Then the object moved very little from left to right for a short time of around 10 seconds. Immediately thereafter, the movement started going down towards the earth in a straight line. This downward movement lasted about 15 to 20 seconds as the fire type light started to fade away in intensity. After the full downward movement of 20 seconds or so the light did indeed fade into darkness.

From my observation the best explanation I could come up with is the fire light might have been possibly an airplane which was engulfed in flames or perhaps an erratic moving missile which seems more unlikely. In any case, this could not have been a type of fancy firework considering how long it lasted and the nonlinear movement.","Network Operations Manager",2,1,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2009,2000,3,7,21,"Evening","Midwest",0,1,0,0,0

I was standing on my patio near my wife.  I heard my wife and a friend telling us What is That? and I looked up and saw an oval shaped, red thing in the air.  Definitely not an airplane, missile, or satellite. It was going 150 mph approximately which is pretty slow for something in the air. It was glowing as it headed from the South East to the West.  It was not floating, it was moving.  I have nothing to compare it to because it looked so different. I have seen fighter jets at night with their afterburners on, helicopters, commercial, private, and military planes, vintage war birds, blimps, kites, sky divers, and this was nothing like them in any way.   It was silent and it became lighter as it went along its horizontal path.  It continued in a curve, slightly changing direction and upwards at a shallow angle before it flew out of sight.

It was just after dusk; I was 9 years old sitting in my grandmother?s kitchen floor playing with jacks.  My grandmother was also in the kitchen, standing at the sink washing dishes, and her daughter (my aunt) was just off the side using the phone and looking out the sliding glass back door.

Suddenly my aunt let out a terrifying scream and was pointing upward at something just outside that door.  My grandmother leaned over and was looking out the window in front of her and terror struck her face as she ran to that door.  They were both just standing there, with their mouths and eyes wide open.

Frantically I was asking, ""What?s wrong?  What?s going on?,"" but I couldn?t see ""up"" from behind them.   I knew something was terrible from the frightened looks of their faces.  Finally my aunt mumbled, ""It?s a UFO,"" and I wanted to see too, but I was too scared to look then.  They began talking about the bright white lights surrounding this ""UFO,"" and how close it was.  And just as quickly as it came, it was gone.   By the time I got to the door there was nothing to be seen.

Many questions later revealed that they believed it was a UFO because of its circular shape and the lights all around the exterior.  It was unlike anything that was normally flying in the sky.  They said it came real close to the earth; that it was just above the roof of the house and hovered in that one spot for maybe 10 seconds and then shot off like a bullet into the unknown.

While reminiscing years later, I brought up that night during a family gathering.  My grandmother and aunt both had no recollection of the event whatsoever.  It hadn?t been that long ago and they both had excellent memory.   I had thought maybe they were joking with me, but they really didn?t know what I was talking about and declared innocence when I asked them if they were just playing a joke on me when I was a kid.

I still ask them occasionally if they remember and always get an unsuccessful response.

My memory of that night is quite vivid; I could never forget the sound of her screaming, and the looks of shock in their eyes.

My wife and I were driving down State Highway 65 in MN from Isanti to Fridley on a clear spring day. We were about 15 minutes into our drive when I glanced out the drivers side window to the east and saw a teardrop shaped object that appeared to be falling in the sky, and left absolutely no trail outside of the taper to the teardrop ""point"". The object was about 3/4 white and the center of it was a dull black, almost a matte black. I was watching the object, about 30 seconds after I saw it we heard fighter jets flying. we saw 4 jets flying directly at the object, and the closest air base is about 100 miles away in Brainerd. The jets flew directly at the object, which appeared to be slowly descending about 30 degrees above the horizon. At this point the jets had appeared to be closing in. Suddenly we heard another jet, and looked to see 3 more (i think) jets flying toward the object. I would estimate that the object was somewhere above central Wisconsin. As the jets are flying, we looked toward the west and saw a bullet shaped silver craft that appeared to be burning atmosphere. Then another fighter jet flew toward the west. The object descended past the tree line, where neither of us could see it anymore. The object in the west has taken a turn and headed south where we lost track of it in the sun.

Unfortunately, I don?t remember the exact date, but it was a starry night in the summer in northern Alabama (about 15 miles north of Huntsville).  The Milky Way was overhead and extremely brilliant. It must have been a new moon and I lived in a small country town so there were no lights and lots of stars. My father was in the garage working on his car when my boyfriend and I came back early from a date. We parked in the yard away from the house and decided to lie on his hood and see who could find and name the most constellations. We were parked facing an easterly direction. I was looking toward the south and my boyfriend toward the north. 

Suddenly he grabbed me and said, ""Look there.""  At first I didn?t see anything.  Then my eye caught a movement under the starry sky.  No lights, no sound.  It appeared to be 7 disc-shaped objects flying in a tight V formation.  There were 3 discs on one side and 4 on the other, so not even.  Or at least it appeared that way.  We weren?t sure if it was one object or seven.  The only reason we could see it was because the star light reflected from the bottom and the fact that it moved across the star scape. 

Since we had no perspective we could not tell how far above it was.  But I saw it at about 11 O?Clock (my left) and it moved very quickly to the south.  

After it left, we listened for a few seconds but heard nothing.  I yelled for my Dad but he didn?t come out in time.  Something that I feel is very significant is that the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville at that very time had the Apollo missile.  I remember a big to-do about transporting it to Florida.  Also, my father who worked for IBM had just been told he was being transferred with the contract to Cape Kennedy.  I have always felt there was some kind of connection.

July 2009 My UFO Experience:  I was walking up the sidewalk/steps to our south facing home on Law St. in Pacific Beach (San Diego, Ca 92109) in 1970 or 1971, I think about 11 to 12pm when I glanced up at a cold clear night sky & saw a large craft the size of a blimp perhaps with many lights (in fact all I saw were the lights, no outline of the object) approaching to my right & slightly to the north moving silently from east to west.  It was being trailed by two fighter jets (I assume from Miramar Naval Airstation or North Island) that were shooting tracers towards it.  This obviously grabbed my attention.  I had never seen tracers other than in WWII documentaries.

As the craft came to be directly in front of me (well above the roofline of the house to the north), it turned north on a dime and accelerated & vanished in an instant.  I realized that it was a UFO when I saw it streak towards LA like a bullet & disappear.  The two jets, which I could now hear, continued to follow by slowly arcing to the north.  The pilots had to be as totally mystified as I was. No man made craft then or now could have made that maneuver.  I thought about reporting this to some authority like the police or the newspaper, but it was late & I just went to bed.  I told my family & friends the next day & I combed the San Diego Union to see if anyone else had reported this but found nothing.

This is by far the most incredible & unexplainable thing I have ever witnessed, and to this day I can still visualize it like it happened last night.  I have never witnessed a remotely similar event & to my knowledge, no one has ever reported seeing a UFO over San Diego.

I have always wanted to notify an appropriate organization to see if an investigation could locate a Navy report which had to have been filed by the pilots, perhaps two per jet.

From that point forward in my life I have always had a tremendous interest in UFO sightings, documentaries, stories, etc.

I have had a lifelong interest in the manned space program (I  still have an old scrapbook of news & magazine articles about the Mercury, Gemini & Apollo programs) as well as astronomy & the knowledge constantly evolving about the Universe. I loved the movie Contact so much that I read Carl Sagan?s novel which was just as awesome.

I have watched some UFO programs on the Discovery Channel & I believe there were several very well documented UFO sightings/encounters near Catalina Island or the Channel Islands around this time.  I have been wondering if there is a connection between those events & the one I witnessed.  I would love to discuss my experience with a relevant organization in the hopes that it sheds new light or somehow furthers our understanding of this type of phenomenon.

Last night my husband and I were out in our pool for a late night swim. It was a cloudless night and the stars were out. We had our lights all turned off to enjoy the night sky. We had come out around 11:35 pm and had been in the pool about five to ten minutes when I noticed lights in the sky coming over the house behind us.  At first I thought it was a plane, because our house is in a flight path. They were in a distinct triangular shape that in some ways mimicked that of a fighter jet's elongated triangle--  but the lights made a triangular shape that was bigger than a plane, you could see sky through and around them.

They were small orange points of light, and looked extraordinarily similar to the smallest stars we could see in the sky except of course that they were moving, and fast, flying in what appeared almost like a perfect flock of geese formation, except with two rows instead of one. I instantly pointed them out to my husband and we watched them as they passed almost directly overhead and past our house from Northwest to Southeast. There was no sound whatsoever either before, during or after they passed, other than that of the usual street traffic nearby, etc.

Once we realized they were separate lights and not a single plane, I was honestly afraid they might  be missiles of some kind, because they were so small and high and going so fast,  their color was so uniform, and there was no sound.  Honestly, I have no idea whether missiles make noise or not, but it's all my mind could come up with at the time.   Also as they passed one of the tiny dots of light moved out of the V formation and away and then back into it.   They continued on in their straight path until they disappeared over the roof of our house. The whole thing only lasted 20-25 seconds or so traveling from the horizon of one rooftop to the horizon of the opposite rooftop.

There seems to me to be absolutely no question that what we saw was not a natural event, but a group of-- I have no idea what. I am completely at a loss. But those orange lights were most definitely in a formation, and wherever they were going, they were going fast.

I have never reported anything like this before in my life until today. Would love to know what it was we saw.",NA,2,0,"unknown",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2009,2000,3,7,23,"Night",NA,0,1,0,0,0

My boyfriend and I were in my car leaving texas city on palmer highway just passed under I45 a few minutes before. It was dark out and there was no other cars or buildings around. All together the road has four lanes two going one direction and two going the other with feeder roads on both sides. We had just left a pretty busy area but now there was nothing but thick trees around.

 We were driving for a few minutes in the darkness with our windows down without talking or listening to the radio when we heard a weird sound shoot through the car behind us.  It sounded like a sound effect you would here in a pink floyd song.  It sounded very sharp and fast like a lazer type noise cutting threw the air. It went from the passenger side where I was to the drivers side behind us and then made a ""ding"".  When I explain it, it probably sounds like something flew in a hit something.  My mom asked, ""Are you sure someone didn't shoot at you?""  Not only is the highly unlikely but a bullet does not make that sound.  A bullet sounds like something cutting through the air, yes, but not like a weird lazer type sound effect.  And the strange ding at the end sounded like something hitting hollow metal...or tapping a glass with a spoon or something.  Also, I looked in my car for any type of object that could have came in through the windows or any kind of damage from som! ething flying in and hitting it and found nothing.  Nor could I find anything that would have made a ""ding"".

 When I heard it I thought to myself ""what the hell?"" because it was so unexplainable, something I never had heard nor thought I would hear in such a place. I said to my boyfriend, ""Did you hear that?""  And he replied, ""You heard that too?""  I said, ""Yeah what the hell was it?"" He had no explanation either.  So of course we went home and told everyone we came across.

I am still really confused by the noise, I'm not saying it had anything to do with aliens or whatever but I do know for sure that what I heard was so strange that my boyfriend and I can not even register what it was in our heads.   To me it was like a crazy sound wave cutting through the air with no object or anything just a crazy sound. Something you would hear in a Pink Floyd song.  I have thought of seeing UFO's and ghosts and all the other unexplainable things but I never even dreamed of hearing an unexplainable sound. I could go on all day and never be able to give someone a good mental thought of what it really sounded like because its hard to understand if you didn't hear it.  I never even knew i could hear something like that until that night.  I would love to know if anyone else has ever heard and unexplainable noise.

3 years ago i had 2 friends overnight at my new house and we decided to throw and all nighter.

So we went down to the Craigie Primary School to lie on the roof and gaze at the stars because the sky was clear and the stars clearly visible.

Then my friend said he saw a red light in the sky, but me and my other friend couldnt see it.

Then we both saw it, there was a little red light which looked like a star, as it must have been pretty high up.

It was moving really smoothly around in maneuvers that modern aircraft wouldnt be able to pull off.

We saw 2 or 3 more lights, they were all moving around in these difficult maneuvers.

Then suddenly one of them sped up, zoomed off and dissappeared out of our sight like a bullet and it seemed it went around the earth in seconds, or maybe another one joined the group because we saw one speed over our heads and join the group again as if the light circum navigated the globe in about 10 seconds.

They all left a small light trail behind when they moved really fast and when they wern't moving really fast they were just wafting lazily in circles.

It was strange, one second the ywere wafting, then doing difficult maneuvers then speeding off the face of the earth and reappearing from the other side.

We watched this into the morning hours until it was too bright to see them anymore then we went inside and decided to go to sleep.

We always just passed it off as a meteor shower or something we were really freaked out that we witnessed this.

I just decided to Report this tonight because i want to know if anyone else has witnessed anything similar to this so i can hear their recollection of the event.

While watching the stars (as I do each evening with my son), I noticed a very bright, pure white light due south of our location. It was approximately 40 degrees above the horizon, and looked like a light shining down on the Earth -- that is, it was shaped like a cone, brightest at the top and fading out at the lower edge, which was about 5-10 degrees lower. Several things struck me about this event. First, it was very large, covering several degrees of the sky horizontally and vertically. Second, the apex of the cone was flattened, as you would see if someone were shining a flashlight down -- it wouldn't come to a perfect point, it would be flat at the rim of the flashlight. Third, it did not move at all -- at first it reminded me of a comet, but I knew that couldn't be, and then a meteor, but that would be true only if it were coming straight at me (which is possible). I turned to the screen door and called for my wife to come see. When I turned back, ther! e was only a luminescent cloud where the light had been shining. My wife, exiting another door, confirmed this. Could it have been a meteor coming head-on at us? That's the best explanation I can come up with.

 There were commercial aircraft in the vicinity, what I believe was regular westbound traffic from Logan or Bradley airports.

While walking around the block we suddenly noticed a bright light high in the sky and our gaze was drawn upward to the southwest.  At first it looked like a single bright beam of light, then a second similar beam of light appeared briefly, then they both faded away.  It seemed to leave a round ""cloud"" of vapor that lasted for perhaps a minute before disappearing and leaving a perfectly clear sky.  The light beam was very high in the sky and we never did see or hear a vehicle.

 We don't know what caused this but speculated that it could have been landing lights on a jet plane showing up in a jet  trail or the clouds. Or could it be the exhaust from a military jet (or rocket) going supersonic?  The beam of light seemed somewhat unusual in that it seemed to spread out more, almost appearing like a jet trail. The light beams seemed to point downward to the earth and the direction of movement seemed to be upward.

 We get a lot of jet traffic in the sky from New York (JFK, La Guardia) and and Newark airports. But this was different than anything we've ever seen before. Usually their landing lights go out horizontally and don't spread out as wide.

In addition, the lights disappeared from sight vertically.

 The object was only about 10-15 degrees away from a planet we believe to be Jupiter, and we noted its relative size and brightness to be similar to slightly larger than that of Jupiter.

 A massive cone of white light first appeared below the object, then brightened and grew in size as the object rose vertically.  The object and its' cone of white light disappeared from view after 15-20 seconds.

To whom it may concern:  I am writing to report a UFO sighting that occurred this evening, September 19, 2009, at approximately 8 p.m. EST in the hills of western Massachusetts. My husband, sons and I were returning home in our car, when I spotted something in the sky. At first glance, I thought it was a helicopter with a spotlight hovering over a house a few houses down from ours. The light made a cone shape with the widest part closer to the earth and the apex was very bright. We pulled into our driveway and got out of the car, and there was no sound coming from it, eliminating the possibility of a helicopter. Then, it appeared as if the ?spotlight? retreated into a small cloud or a sort of a mist and faded out. The ?mist? quickly dissipated. There is a cloudless sky here tonight, and so whatever the mist was came from the object that we couldn?t see. It was just a light and then it was gone. There was no smell. We have eliminated the possibility of a flare, firework, or aircraft. No lightening. I! t is a clear, starry, cool, late summer, early fall evening. I am at a loss.

 I hope I have described this adequately enough.

N.E Ohio, Canton. My wife and I stopped over to my mother-in-laws to pick the kids up after dinner. Mother-in law was outside on the back patio with a couple of her girl friends deciding on where they were going out to eat. This was around 19:50. Being a very clear night sky. Facing south, I looked up and noticed a very bright star a little Southeast from where I was facing.

 This was just a normal star. I got involved in some conversation and then again at about 20:00 I looked back at the same star just noticing how bright it was on the clear night. I then glanced over to the East. I then saw another bright light that was very high, and illuminating light downward.  (like the sun does when it shines through clouds). First, I thought it was another star, but as I watched it , it was weird since it was shining a very noticeable light down like the sun shining light through the clouds.

 I just starred at it wondering what it was since the light shining down illuminated like the sun shining through clouds. Not knowing what it was. I grabbed the attention of my wife, mother-in-law and her friends, and my oldest son. I asked them what it was. There was no reply as everyone just starred at it. I would say about 30 sec. after I grabbed everyone?s attention, the light giving off the illuminating light started to rise, slow at first straight up. Then within a sec. the light and the light shining downward were gone!! You could actually see the ball of light and the illuminating light rise up.!!! THEN....There was no light anywhere!! It was gone within a sec. of moving up. We couldn?t even trace it. It was gone!  I then looked over at the star I was looking at earlier just trying to make sense of what I just witnessed. the original star was still there and didn't move.  We tried to reason with what we just saw. My Mother-in-law and wife who couldn't believe what we just saw, took the skeptic approach. Trying to reason by saying it could have been a jet since the Akron/Canton Airport is 10 miles from the house. However, We were able to compare a jet flying in the distance about 8 ? 10 min. later. We all came to the same conclusion. What we saw was not a jet. The jet did not give off nearly as much light as the light we saw in the sky (actually, there is no comparison).  Plus the jet moved. The light we saw sat still for about 30sec. while we all were watching it, The jet was considerably smaller, and had flashing lights. The light we saw in the sky did not flash any lights. We had no answers to what we just witnessed. I would say the light location could have been I the area of Canto! n/Louisville/East Canton, Ohio. We still can't get over how the light was shining down, then just raised and disappeared with in a sec. The jet we saw later, we were able watch it?s path as it flew in the sky at night which appeared to be around the same distance and elevation., But the Light we all watched  just disappeared. I didn?t know who to contact in the area to report it.

Just as she was coming out, the object that was emitting this light seemed to have shot straight up, and the cone of light started to disperse.

It continued to radiate downward for approximately 10 seconds, remained there for maybe another 5-10 seconds, and then began to dissipate slowly.  One of our party thought it dissipated first from the center of the cone.  The other two didn?t notice that but rather saw the entire triangle dissipate slowly.  The entire even probably took 30 seconds.

A stationary white light, almost looked about as bright as a street light in the sky.  It seemed circular, there was no side to side movement, nor up or down.  I observed the light for about two minutes, and it faded once, and faded twice, at which point it was no longer visible.  The sky was clear tonite, i was in front of a blockbuster video in west grove pa, looking at an approximate 45 degree angle.

Okay, so I have never seen anything like this before. It was me, my boyfriend, his mom, dad and brother, and we were sitting by a fire in the back yard. The whole back yard is free of trees and you can see the sky very clearly. It wasn't cloudy. All of a sudden, by boyfriend looked up, and saw a bright light. It looked as though a spot light was shining down on us. My first thought was that it was just that, a spot light or something of the like. But then, it started to dissipate. Like it started to disappear, the light was going back to the sky. Not like it was coming from the earth but above it. We were like is that seriously happening? It just disappeared. But the light was so large, that it looked like a huge moon underneath light clouds.... i don't even know if i am explaining it well enough but it was really creepy, especially after the ""unidentified creature"" in panama. I mean people are saying its a hairless albino sloth... but who is to say its not.! Who is to say its not an alien... and now there are random sitings of strange lights in the sky. I mean its nothing like i have ever seen before, it was just this HUGE light in the sky... and it got all foggy and it was so strange.. we were all just sitting there in disbelief, like did that just happen???????????? There was no sound, it moved slightly, and there was just a huge beam coming from it.... i dont know.. were just all really freaked out right now... and i thought i should post it on something... i dont know...

It was a beautiful crisp and clear evening, with no clouds in the sky. The sighting took place at Veterans Park on 9/19/2009 at 8:05 pm and 51 degrees in Norwalk, Connecticut out in the Harbor. We were coming in the Harbor on our boat (4 people on board) from Sprite Island after a BBQ, with our friends following us in their boat(with 5 people on board), heading for the dock, when we noticed this exceptionally very large bright light over the harbor,that was a conical shape shining down. We watched to see is this was possibly a helicopter,or some other type of aircraft that was searching for something, but then the light started to go straight up into the sky until it was no longer visible. It left a slight vapor mist, that was white and hazy that evaporated. There was absolutely no noise, it was silent.That's when we knew it couldn't be a plane or helicopter,it did not fly forward, it flew straight up.

The group of observers (being 9 total)ranged from Age 11 to 50. There were 4 children,2-11year olds, 1-12 year old, 1-13 year old,and the adults 1- advertising executive,1-marketing director,1-Interior designer, 1 Photographer,1-Guest visiting from Australia.

The diffuse beam behind the bright ball began to change shape.  For about a second it was heart shaped and then more triangularagain.  It looked as though it was passing through a cloud, but the sky was cloudless.  The ball of light in the front went out and then within about 30 seconds the entire thing was gone from the sky.

In the Southern sky, about 30 degrees up from the horizon was a star that rapidly got brighter and larger. No noise just a bright white light getting bigger. There are no clouds in the sky. The ""star"" appears to expel a gas-like, bluish, white cloud that falls downward. Maybe this is an explosion? The star remains in place and the ""cloud"" looks like it is starting to hang in a triangle shape (with the ""star"" at the apex).

I looked up and saw what looked like a spot light shining down from the sky through a mist or a cloud.  I pointed it out.  First reaction, rational, was that it was a helicopter.   We heard no sound of a helicopter at all, and the light seemed to high up to be a helicopter, especially given the fact that it seemed to be emanating from a cloud.  About 20 seconds later, the light seemed to rise straight up, getting enveloped in the cloud.  I say this because the light became diffused as if in a cloud of mist.  Eventually it dimmed and was no longer visible.

My husband, a friend, our two kids and I were walking with the end of the day crowd at Knoebel's Amusement Park back to the parking lot.  We were looking up towards Jupiter, as it was really bright and the sky was so clear.

 All of a sudden, to the right of the bright planet, there came this light that looked like it came through a cloud, but there was not a cloud in the sky.  It's hard to describe.  It got brighter and then a cone of white light shone downwards.  The cone of light was hazy as if there were a fog, but there was no fog or clouds.  It was a completely clear sky.  It traveled along towards us slowly and then slowly faded away.  The total time visible was 30 seconds.  Unfortunately, I did not get a picture of the object.

 We were not the only ones who saw it.  The people walking next to us were gasping amongst themselves about it.  We walked further into the parking lot and the parking attendants were chatting on their radios about it.  The one man even asked me if I saw it and asked me to confirm on the radio what he was saying to the one other who hadn't seen it.

 It was the strangest thing any of us had ever seen and we spent a long time trying to think of plausible explanations for it, but couldn't.  The way it moved, how it appeared, no engine sound (helicopter or jet)-- nothing we could offer up for an explanation was valid.

It shown for about 30 seconds and then the aperture closed up and the light was gone.

 Now there were some hot air balloons in the area earlier in the evening when it was still light out but none of us believe that the flame of a balloon could create what we saw.  The outline of the ?aperture in the sky? was very well defined and the light shown directly down toward the ground.

For a few seconds we watched the object and then it emitted what looked to be a smoke or some kind of water vapor, or vapor of some sort (white like steam) as the light shined through it.

It looked like the vapor was forced really hard out of or from the object for a few seconds and then the light, or bright object rose into the sky and dissapeared. As the object dissapeared, the smokey looking vapor stayed there and looked like it stayed lit from the object and then faded into the dark and ""un cloudy"" star filled sky.

The object looked to be only a few hundred feet off the ground. VERY large

On September 19, 2009 at 7:50 PM, I was laying on a hammock facing the southern sky on my raised (level to a second story) back porch. The sky was dark, after sunset. I had been watching the stars come out. The sky was clear, no cloud coverage at all. No moon in the sky. (The moon was in new phase, and rising and setting during the day, according to a moon phase website). The hammock is on a self-supporting frame, and there is nothing on my porch to block my view facing east or south. My house was to my right, or west. I was looking at my phone when a bright light above and slightly to the right of my perspective caught my attention.

 The light was an extremely bright and extremely large white light, shining down towards the ground. It was very high in the air, possibly higher than aircraft would generally fly.

 The light spread out like an upside down cone, but without a distinguishable tip.  For about 15 seconds, the outline or form of the light was very clear and distinguishable. The light was about the size of a normal full moon, or just slightly smaller.

 The light rose vertically.  As it did, the clarity of the outline of the light dissipated and was replaced by a patch of ?brightness? in the sky, which slowly became larger and larger, then faded slowly to black. This process lasted about 4 minutes.

 At its largest, this patch of brightness against the night sky would have about filled the dipper portion of the big dipper before fading to black.

 The simplest way for me to describe it is it was as if someone had turned on the brightest spotlight I could imagine from the atmosphere, and as it ascended, I seemed to be viewing the light from underneath the source.

 According the compass on my iPhone, the light was approximately at 180 -189 degrees south.

 I thought to run inside and grab my camera, but figured I would miss it. I attempted a picture with my iPhone, but by this point, I could only make out a bright patch against the night sky and the iPhone could not record anything in the sky.

 The light was completely faded at 7:55 PM.

We were at a father-son camping trip with the cub scouts near Green Lane, PA. While we were there, all of the scouts and parents witnessed a very bright hovering light in the sky at around 8:30 p.m\.  It looked to be about a mile away and about 100 feet off the ground. There was no noise associated with it.  It was casting a light down like a bright spotlight. It was not a star or planet.  The light then seemed to disappear behind clouds (there was a bright, dissipating mist) however, there were no clouds that night. It was very still and crisp fall light.  Although we tried to explain the light, none of the parents could come up with a reasonable explanation. It could not have been a helicopter, as there were no other blinking lights and there was no sound.

The orb disapeared into thin air after about 20 seconds, but left the tail for another 45 seconds. I did not leave until 2 hours later and had no other sightings of the object.

It was a beautiful night. We were watching planes in the sky, and we know that this was no plane.  It did not move.  The light slowly disappeared.  We never saw anything like it. We are not nuts.

That?s when a bright light appeared out of nowhere at about 1000 feet up to the left of my girlfriend,  I told her: ?Turn around and look at that bright light up there.?  She was so happy to finally see something like this.

 As we were looking at this bright light, a beam of light came from the bottom of this object, the beam of light was a controlled beam, something I have never seen before.  For example when you turn on a beam of light, it simply goes on and you can?t control it?s length.

 It started off small then as the beam got longer it got wider, the beam of light never came down to the ground.  Inside the beam of light was slow moving white and green mist, the beam of light stayed in one spot and did not move at all.  There was no sound, then the beam of light started to get shorter until there was no beam left, then the light just started getting dimmer until it turned off.

 It was not a helicopter because there were no aircraft lights or sound.

On Friday, October 30th at around 10:20PM I was on my balcony smoking a cigarette when I noticed a very large light moving from the North-West to the South-East. What got my attention is that the light was larger than the normal flight traffic you get here between LAX and John Wayne airports. It was a deep orange color, no wing tip lights or other normal blinking marker lights. I watched for more than 5 minutes as it approached my location growing bigger, before I called to my son. My 19yo son commented that this was very definitely not our normal passenger air traffic, and that is very unsettling.

 A few moments later the light made a turn to our left and headed do west out over the Pacific Ocean and gained altitude. Just at this moment it seemed to break apart or drip debris. Looked very much like burning embers falling from the object and fading as the fell. Both my son and I felt that this must have been a burning aircraft up until it turned and gained altitude as it headed out to sea.

 We see a tremendous amount of air traffic (civilian and military) here as well as occasional launches from Vandenberg AFB. This was very definitely not either! Too big to be aircraft and missile launches generally produce a very white light. Waited to report until today as we assumed we would hear about it in the news today.

 Last night was an almost full moon and exceedingly clear cloudless night. The altitudes and speeds  seemed consistent with general aviation, although the size and orange color were inconsistent as well as the turn towards the pacific and the debris falling. Total viewing time 10-12 minutes.

While walking down the dirt road 100 yards from my driveway in a southbound direction with my daughter and her friend, joking with me saying ?Look! That?s the brightest star in the sky!? After I glanced up and told her it wasn?t a star, it was Jupiter, I looked back down at the road; seconds later, she says ?LOOK DAD THAT?S SOOO WEIRD!? I looked, and what I saw was an upside down funnel shape; white hazy in color, (like a flashlight pointing down inside a hazy white Smokey shade that extended downward; no movement, no clouds, and no noise). Before fading into the sky, the bottom center of the cone seemed to change position from 6 o?clock to 4 o?clock, the top still anchored in the same position. My daughter saw a dark cloud above the shape, I didn?t notice it. I can?t estimate the distance with any accuracy but was very far off in my opinion.

The shape was a little lower and to the right; a couple finger widths of Jupiter in the Capricornus Constellation; Jupiter?s elevation is about 20 degrees approximately. You could see an aircraft heading east very far up in atmosphere with marker lights blinking barely visible, just after incident; by comparison the cone was huge.

At approx. 2AM while facing exactly North i noticed what i first thought to be a shooting star.  As i stared,... I noticed it to be 5 distinct shooting stars coming from the East going westbound.  Orange/amber in color, spaced apart as if they were 'tracer bullets' in the sky moving extremely fast; uniform in direction and trajectory (or lack of trajectory - almost a straight line).

I was almost able to make out a chevron in the first, but they were so high up and moving so fast that it wasn't a vivid chevron per say, but the color did look un-natural to the night sky (dimmer but 'steadier glow' than typical stars). The formation crossed the entire night sky and I lost sight of it as it headed further west/northwest coming from the east, almost directly overhead... about 70-80 degrees.

The shapes came together or it could have been the angle, but they disappeared as they 'converged' still at approx 80 degrees.

The night sky was surprisingly clear and I immediately posted a question on yahoo answers dated 03/16/2010.  I do observe meteor showers and comets when in season, but this looked nothing like anything i had observed in the past...  the objects seemed to be flying extremely fast for any man made vehicle, but steadier (did not fade out) than shooting stars i've seen in the past.

The color was clearly orange amberish.

At aproximately 9:30 pm Est I went out on the porch to smoke a cigarette when I noticed a really extremely bright light in the sky. It was unusual in its shape and size.

The light was very very bright and seemed to be unstable as if beams were shooting out from all over it.

A I watched this object, just to the left of it what at first I thought was a plane flew right into it.  I looked to the right thinking it was going fly past it and it did not. That is when I jumped up and told my son something is not right with that object I think it is a UFO.

As we watched it within 3-4 minutes two white bullet  shapes objects came out of it,one on the left and one on the right.

I ran in and grabbed my video camera and started filming it. We watched as its movements were irratic at times and at one time before it completely disappeared it came closer and then backed away and then disappeared.

Within about 5 minutes it reappeared in the same area and to the right of it a red object appeared in the sky.

The red object moved faster than any jet we had ever seen. It was if it was encircling the the white object. Then all of a sudden they disappear and we see flashes of white light as if someone was taking a picture and the flash was so bright.

By now our neighbors were outside watching the activity and we noticed all the planes coming into our airport were circling away and we noticed jets taking off in the direction of the ufos. All of a sudden we hear a sonic boom and we look at the traces in the sky from the jets heading in that direction.

I tried to video tape the red object and the happenings afterwards but for some odd reason I could not get it to film, all I got was static across my screen as I tried to film it.

My husband and I were walking our 2 dogs, and we were passing through the parking lot at Bridgeport Shopping Center, which is at the NE corner of the intersection of Newhall Ranch Road and McBean Parkway, in Valencia, California.  Valencia is part of the incorporated town of Santa Clarita, if you're searching for it on a map.  Bridgeport Shopping Center has pedestrian walkways and lower buildings - it's new, and is mostly empty in the evenings, we guess there were about 10 other people around the shopping center at that moment but no one was near us. We were at the far East side of the parking lot where there are few street lights.

We were walking East toward Grandview Drive when my husband noticed a long line of red lights in the sky that appeared above the treeline, not too high up, and were acting in a very bizarre fashion. If the lights were on some kind of craft/s then it was completely silent.

There were about 12 lights - all RED, no white, and they were in a line, as if connected to a leading edge. At first it was just hovering - for maybe one minute, and then started to slowly float Southeast. The string of lights never descended. We didn't see a solid shape behind the lights, it was too dark, we could only see the lights themselves. They all seemed to be about the same size. The size of the lights themselves -- relative to a star in the night sky -- they were the same size as the brightest star in the sky. All together, the span of the lights in a line reached almost completely across our entire field of view. They were above the horizon, well above the treeline, and above the rooftops of everything around.

It was very hard to gauge where exactly the thing was, we guestimated it was over Eastern Santa Clarita, East of the 5 Freeway, but West of the 14, North of Lyons Avenue and potentially South of Newhall Ranch Road, where we were standing ? although it appeared directly over us. It was a straight line of lights at a 45 degree angle. Like a stick, turned up on an angle. This was the shape ""/"", with the tallest part rising on its right side, with the whole thing heading slowly South by SouthEast. It (the string of lights) never broke formation. It slowly floated South-South East until it became so dim we could no longer see it, without ever changing the distances between the lights themselves. They were not evenly spaced. The whole line silently hovered and then slowly floated off, with entire sections blinking on and off randomly. It was very long/wide! As a gauge, if I hold my thumb out away from me (about 2.5 feet) and my thumb represents one of the lights that we saw - then! the whole line of lights took up my entire field of view. (It took about 5 minutes for it to disappear from view.)  Just when we thought the whole line was lit up, another light would blink on, to the far left or far right - making the total string even wider/longer. The lights did not look like flares to me. I have seen flares and these lights were constantly blinking on and off, wildly -- quickly pulsating. There was never a time when all the lights were on uniformly at the same time, they were always shimmering. Sometimes whole sections would just go out and come back on again 10 seconds later, in random order.

The lights, always red, were all blinking/shimmering fast, but not uniformly, and not strobing in any regular pattern and with no regular timing, not the way aircraft safety lights would. Any one light also had an irregular pattern. We thought -- could it be a squadron of helicopters? But the lights didn't behave in a predictable way. These red lights would go on and off in random order and with random timing by first becoming dim, then bright, then dim, then off, and then bright again -- as if they were shimmering. My husband commented that it looked like the special effects on TV when a craft goes into ""cloaking"" mode, or the way lights look reflected in water. He is a skeptic and he was dumbfounded as to what we were seeing.

Position relative to each other: the lights kept their exact distance from one another the whole time, even as the line of lights drifted South. The size of the individual lights was like looking at red car brake lights from 2 miles away. That's the only way I can describe it - against the night sky they were as bright and big as the biggest/brightest star in the sky. We can't tell how high the string of lights was, but we couldn't see any other stars through them. We could not see if it was one solid craft, or many lights. They did remain in a stable position relative to one another - at least giving the illusion that they were along the edge of one craft. I've seen sheriff's dept. helicopters fly nightly over town and I would say these lights appeared to be floating around the same height. They were not too distant, definitely over town, not over the mountains. It took several minutes for them to go a few miles.

We ran East along the sidewalk to keep a view of it, and eventually the line disappeared as it floated out of view, and became dimmer, eventually disappearing completely from our line of sight. We stared for 5 more minutes and then started to walk home, heading East toward the edge of the parking lot. Then we saw another set of lights, doing exactly the same thing, just over the treeline to the East of Grandview Road. The line had the same weird pattern of red lights shimmering off and on and lasted for 2-3 minutes but was not quite as wide and was oriented horizontally. It didn't drift or descend, it just got more and more dim and finally was down to 2 lights, and then disappeared.

We stared a little longer, and then walked home. I immediately called the Sheriff station for Santa Clarita. I reported what we saw and the police officer said they had over 100 calls reporting UFOs already that night. He could not say if people reported the same thing we saw.

The sky was filled with other aircraft that night, heading into Burbank airport or LAX. They all looked normal compared to this.

I was sat watching TV at about 1.15 am when My Husband came home from a late shift.  I got up to have a ciggy outside the back door and as I usually do when I go outside at night  I glanced up up to the sky.

Just at that moment two bright white lights shot over our house, one just behind the other.  They were going at super fast speed, and I judged them to be quite low (About the same height as the local air ambulance helicopter flies over)  I can only compare the speed of them to war zone footage I have seen on TV of tracer bullets fired at night. they were that fast.

It looked like one was tailing the other, and both seemed to be darting slightly from side to side as they travelled forwards. They got to a point just over the school behind our house and without slowing just shot up vertically and then vanished in the cloud. They were completely silent. No noise at all.

Al this took maybe a matter of seconds. I was just stood there looking up with my mouth open. It really was a ""WHAT THE FU.....!"" moment.

The hair on the back of my neck literally did stand on end!  I have never seen anything like it in real life. They looked just like those little things that fly around in the film ""Close Encounters"". In fact, that is what I thought as I was stood looking up at them. (I know that sounds like a bit of a cliche but that is the best way to give you an idea of what they looked like.)   I have no bloody clue as to what it was.  I had no time to get my a camera and film them, and even if I did I think I would have been to preoccupied to think about grabbing it.

(I would just like to add, even though I am quite interested in reported UFO sightings, I don't particularly go looking for them, and wasn't even sure if I believed in odd things flying around in our skies.

On March 19th at about 5:45 pm we were merging on to I-10, Intersection 203, Capital Circle NW, Tallahassee.  As we were making the final merge onto the interstate I noticed a bright glow on the underside of one of the few white clouds that were in the sky.  As I looked harder I noticed a dark line pointing up towards it at about a 45 degree angle.

I kept my eye on it until it disappeared behind trees, due to the bends in the I-10.  About 7-10 minutes later we were approaching Intersection 196, Capital Circle NE, when we finally got a good look at what we?d seen from a distance.

There were two objects.  The first was a small, highly reflective, bullet shaped object with no wings or tail.  The second was rather more startling.  Keeping pace behind the bullet shaped object was ?V? shaped object that was quite simply the biggest think  I've ever seen in the sky.  Although a good distance away it was easily the size of a football stadium, possibly larger.  The object was dark gray/brown in color.

I have noticed that much of Idaho?s UFO history from before 1970 is totally missing now unless you happen to own a copy of Frank Edwards? book, ""Stranger than Science.""   I cannot find my issue, if I even still have it, but I know one of the entries from personal experience.

During the summer of 1957 my Dad and my Uncle Paul worked together in a post and pole business located one mile west of Donnelly.  In mid-August of that summer they had an order to fill one hundred miles south near Nampa.  The flatbed truck was loaded and they left early one august morning.  When they returned late that night both were filled with an incredible story.

When returning from the Nampa-Boise area they took the only route available which was Idaho State Route 15.  Years later the road would be widened and made a bit straighter and renamed SR 55. Uncle Paul was driving and my Dad was the passenger. Traveling north the trip was uneventful until the moment they turned onto Rainbow Bridge just north of Smiths? Ferry. By the time they reached this area it was twilight or past 9pm. Also, there was no other traffic on the highway at the time. This area is also known as the Cougar Mountain area. At least once a decade, when traveling through the same area, I would ask my Dad to tell the story and point to what he saw. Most recently was in 2003, not too long before he passed away. The story never changed.

In mid-August, 1957 at about 9-9:30pm, northbound Hiway 15 (55) passes Cougar Mountain Lodge and the road continues following the Payette River.  Both the road and the river become narrower with some zigzagging prior to reaching Rainbow Bridge.  The road makes a sharp right onto the bridge.  At that point my Dad yelled ?STOP!? and the old flatbed truck was nearly in the middle of the bridge before coming to a complete stop.  What my Dad had seen was something large and glowing coming right up the river at about the same level above the water as the bridge. As they came to a stop the large object rose slightly to avoid the bridge and missed the cab of the truck by mere feet. Once over the bridge it dipped about 30 feet down to the river then pulled up in a high arc reaching about 500 feet higher than they were, then dove straight down onto the top of a hill. They watched a bit of an explosion, but did not notice any burning of the dense forest. The land had not been logged and th! erefore no roads existed leading to the crash site at that time.

My Dad described the object as circular and shiny on top with a nearly flat bottom. The entire disk glowed with a bright purplish color and was traveling up the river and through its arc at about 60 mph. It was half the width of the bridge making it about 100 feet in diameter.  My Dad would seem to be a good person for observation. He was retired from the Air Force with the rank of Master Gunnery Sgt. He had been in the Flying Tigers and when evacuated from China he was sent to school for the Norden Bomb site and spent the rest of the war in the Flying Fortress. He told stories of ?Foo Fighters? and the first momentary glimpse of this disk coming up the river immediately triggered his old reaction to those earlier foo fighters. Unable to do anything about the crash, the two men continued north for a half hour reaching Cascade, the county seat for Valley County. There they stopped at the police station and filed a report.

During the evening of the next day an Air Force Officer dropped by the house and explained to my Dad and Uncle that what they saw was no more than a missile that had been accidentally launched from a jet out of Mountain Home Air Force Base, southwest of Boise. The officer added that ?You have no reason to be concerned and should just forget about the incident.? I remember looking at the smiling officer and then at my Dad just staring at him for a moment. My reaction was to try to melt in to the background and be out of site for a while. Very calmly my Dad explained to the young smiling officer that he was retired Air Force, added a few details, and knew a missile when he saw one.  He then invited the officer to change his story or leave. That was the last we heard from the Air Force about that incident.

The crash at Smiths? Ferry was at 44o 20? 11.57 N and 116o 03? 27.54 W and by the following day, the Air Force had the entire area stripped clean.

What we saw were at least 50 to 100 oval metallic and sometimes flat shaped and even transparent in nature looking objects move up down from side to side in clusters sometimes they would separate into two large clusters, one of the objects even took off straight up from the others like a missile then straight down and back with the others.  These objects would change direction in such a matter so quickly that from my experience as a retired fireman and who's been around aircraft for over 30 years, there is nothing you can compare with the speed of which these things would move from one area to another.  They would at times disappear and reappear while changing in color from a shinny metallic to a dark color. then after approximately 30 to 40 minutes they started moving toward an east/south direction over the 15 fwy and out of our view in a cluster like formation and extremely fast.

It was just before 10pm on July 4 in Derby, CT, and my girlfriend and I had just gotten to my house.  I had ran inside real quick to turn on the air conditioner and neighbors were setting off fireworks and an orange ball of fire came from over the trees near where the neighbors were.  

My girlfriend yelled to me from outside thinking it was one of the fireworks headed for the house and when I finally got outside to see what she was yelling about, the object continued across the sky from West to East at a constant speed. 

At first, I thought it was a plane on fire, but it wasn't exactly a ""flashing light"" that you would typically see on an airplane, it really looked like something on fire moving across the sky.  It looked like it was about the size of a plane, but it was flying far to low.  We lost sight of the object after it went over my house, and when we walked around the house to track it, the object was gone.  

It could have possibly been a missile launch, it definitely was not fireworks.  I'm not sure how many people witnessed this event other than the two of us.

Then all of a sudden they shot forward going in the same east direction as the white light but in a different path they moved faster than any jet fighter i ever saw.  They lit up like missiles and they traveled as fast as a shooting star.  It lit up like a reentry vehicle trailing fire behind it.

At approximately 9:35 PM Sunday July 4th, Danbury, CT (nearest cross street Belair Drive and Kingswood) I saw what appeared to be an orange teardrop/triangular shaped flame (not a perfect triangle but more triangular than a teardrop) arching overhead.  I first noticed it at 35 degrees WNW from my location.  It continued up overhead to about 85 degrees (almost directly overhead) and gradually faded out of view as it got smaller and smaller ESE at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  It took about 25 seconds to move this distance.  I did not hear a sound coming from this object so I would say that it was above the Earth?s atmosphere but not as high as the International Space Station (ISS) as I?ve spotted that a few times on separate occasions and on one occasion I saw the station also pass almost directly overhead like this object.  I cannot be certain how high the object was but that is my impression.

The object appeared to be a flame although it was different from a typical rocket in that although it remained relatively constant it had a slight flicker to it like the flickering of a candle only a more rapid flickering with more of a sustained luminescence.  The flame appeared to have an edge on the forward side and came to a point at a length of about twice its width.  I could not discern a physical object in front of the flame as I was looking for something in front thinking it was perhaps a missile or the space shuttle.  The light of the object was about half as bright as the ISS at its brightest when I had seen the ISS at about a year ago passing directly overhead.

I saw only the one object and it?s motion was continual and followed a straight path and it was moving at least twice as fast as the ISS (or perhaps the same speed but maybe half the distance?).  This object literally appeared to be rocketing across the sky.  It?s size from my perspective was about 1/8th the size of a full moon as it passed overhead.  There were 4-5 other witnesses across the street about a 100 feet away from me.","Computer Consultant",1,1,"teardrop",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2010,2010,3,7,21,"Evening","Northeast",0,1,0,0,0

We were driving North on Lewis Ave when I noticed two women looking and pointing up into the sky south of town.  

I looked out the car window and saw a orange red fireball!   It looked like a meteorite heading right towards us. The flames were visible.  It was at that point a basketball size.  It was flying north at a downward angle.  It looked like it was right over us.  It then appeared smaller as it turned and leveled out north then suddenly it went East and disappeared.   We got back into the car and headed North.  I looked out again and it reappeared over town again.  We turned the car around and headed South see it, but it disappeared again.   I thought that it was a meteorite or even an Iraq missile headed towards us.  I have never seen anything like it before.

Last night a friend and myself were out on my balcony and we noticed something moving in the sky.  It appeared to be a star, but as we watched it for awhile, we noticed that we could both see something like spurts coming out of it and it would move.  My first impression was something was shooting out of it like a projectile.  It was far enough away to appear as a star but close enough to see almost tracers off of it when it moved.  As we were watching this light move around, another star looking light came floating across the sky towards the one that we were watching and continued past it without stopping or slowing.  There was no erratic movement with the one going across the sky, but it did manage to cross the entire skyline and out of our sight within 2 minutes or less. I don't know how fast that would be.  Now as of July 27th, 2010 there are still lights in the sky and I have noticed up to 6 or more. I have an apartment that has windows facing the other side of my building and I could see more of these moving objects in the sky on that side as well.  It almost appears as if they are making a circle around a large part of my city, but very high up.  I do live in a border town, which borders Sault Ste Marie, Michigan. I noticed one light that stood out more than the rest and it seemed to have a red that I could notice through the white. When I first noticed this light from my balcony, it seemed closer than the others and it was more centered over the international bridge on the USA side. I recently went back out to look and this red and white light seems to have now moved more to the Canadian side and more over Essar Steel which is what I believe to be the 3rd largest steel comapany in the the World. I don't know if anyone else has seen anything like this on either side of the border, but I encourage anyone in the area to take a look and see if you can notice these same lights. This is not my first time seeing the white light with r! ed shining through. I did submit a report back in September of! 2009 wh en I was about 4 to 5 hours out of town and I witnessed a sighting at a closer range that appeared to be the same type of light. My friend that witnessed this recent sighting has also witnessed another sighting about a month ago from his back yard and was lucky enough to get footage of a white star looking light flying at a constant rate across the sky. I have heard of people referring to the movements as almost seeming like the operator is drunk, but being an outdoors man, the best way I could describe the movement is, the way a water spider moves around on the water. I have tried to research satellite flight patterns, but they seem to be moving to fast to be satellites. Thank you for taking the time to read this and for taking an interest.

To the West, over the Rockie Mountains, I saw a grey/silver object floating stationary at my best guess around 30,000 ft. It was near commercial flight altitude. Too high for a helicopter, and not moving at all, unlike a flare, missile, or Satellite.

It would periodically and randomly flash a bright white light at me, as bright as a super bright iredean flare. Not in any kind of consistent order like FAA lights. Every now and again it looked like the light shown right at me. Atleast in my direction.

Over the course of about 10 minutes it started to slowly move off to the North where I couldn't see it anymore.

I took pictures and video of the object. I can't see it yet, but I haven't put it in Photoshop to blow it up and clean it up yet. But I did notice 2 round very strange lense blurs on my camera. Almost look like if you were to look down into a cone of water. Only when I shot photo's of the object did these blurs show up...

These two events occurred in 1989 and 1995 respectfully (approximate) in Phoenix AZ.  I lived North of the city, pretty dark in those days.

The first:  Facing South, a white, star-like solid light, like a medium size star, appeared in the sky very, very high up, at an almost-directly-overhead latitude and crossing the sky coming out of the East to West. I immediately thought it was a satellite. Way too high to be an airplane.  It was either already in space or just on the fringe. And faster than a satellite I was use to seeing.

But just as I told the person I was with to ""look, it's a satellite"", the object stopped crossing the sky half way, almost directly overhead, and literally stopped on a dime, and then went straight up into space, fading out.  It didn't continue across the sky like a satellite would and then instantly 'blink' out when it went into earth's shadow.  This object went straight up.  A 90-degree instant 'turn' up into space.  I verified this in my mind by acknowledging that it did not 'cross' any more stars in any direction.

I'm a private pilot, university graduate and voluminous readings, I know of nothing that would act like this, particularly that it was so high to start with, traverse half the sky, and then abruptly stop and go into space and fade out, not suddenly blink out.

Now here's the kicker:  about six years later, my wife and I were standing in my backyard, same house, facing North this time, looking up towards the horizon, not straight up.  I had told her my UFO story.

Suddenly, There...I instantly knew it was the same 'object', probably because it?s so different then my ?normal?.

It suddenly appeared coming at us, from North to South this time, crossing the sky towards us at a very fast speed.  Both were traveling much faster then the satellites I've seen crossing the sky.  So, from first sighting it near the horizon to it going up into space took about seven seconds and then another two/three seconds as it faded out)   Without taking my eyes off of it this time, I told my wife, ""see the light coming at us?""   Watch...it?s going to come almost overhead, stop, and then go straight up into space and fade out!   And it did just that as I was describing what it would do to her!!  Again, never went 'by' any more starts verifying that it did indeed go 'straight up' into space.

And now I have a witness who's always with me (married). so now it's 'we' who saw it!  Ran across your article in the SOCO Magazine here in Boston MA and thought I'd send you this 'tale'.  I've seen rockets launched in the Air Force (I worked on Minuteman Missiles), saw the shuttle launch in Fla., a missile 'blowup' just after launch in New Mexico (from our backyard in Phx) leaving the colorful contrails from the rising morning sun, we've seen satellites, the shuttle, the space station (as I acknowledged, they cross the 'entire' sky then suddenly blink out when they go into the earth's shadow) but I?ve never seen anything this high in the sky, just a 'bright' dot of a light, that initially looked like a satellite but traveling much faster, stop on 'a dime', and go straight up into space and just fade out.

Any ideas as to what these/this could have been?

My sister and I were fishing the Bridgeport reservoir from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm we were anchored in the Buckeye channel both facing north, and at about 1:00 pm we herd an extremely loud buzzing sound that was making a shallow dive.  It dove 10Ft in front of me.  The object was a blur, and the speculating speed of the object is 125 to 150 mph.  By viewing the splash of 6 inches width x 11 inches length zipper shape.  I discovered that object has approximately two counter rotating props when it drove it self into the water.  The props are approximately 5 inch in diameter on a approximately 1 inch diameter x 12 inches fuselage.  I thought that this is the creature called the Flying Spikes, but this is not a creature but a mechanical projectile supposedly from the military.  

When we arrived to port at 6:00 pm we saw a GMC suburban with four tuff looking men inside just waiting, and when I came up to the suburban the driver said how is it going?  As I past the suburban I over herd one of the men inside say, he?s with his sister.  How do they know I?m with my sister?  

When we got back to our campsite, we herd and saw two gray C130 planes flying over use, extremely low through the cannon towards Bridgeport. Putting 2 & 2 together, I think we have a top secret recover taking place.

I was on a Boy Scout trip when I saw the UFO. We made camp at Camp Crooked Creek, located near Ft. Knox. When the rest of the troop went to bed, I stayed up and made a fire, along with a fellow Scout. At around midnight when the fire had died down to embers is when we saw the UFO.

I remember everything around me flashed in a blue light, exactly the same flash a camera would make (the same amount of time too). Both of us exclaimed ""whoa,"" because it was not only shocking but appeared to come from above us. We both instinctively looked up. About 250-300 yards above me, I made out three dim lights ( in a triangular position). I could barely make out the dark outline of an aircraft, it appeared to be in the shape of a triangle as well. If it didn't have lights on the bottom, i don't think I would have been able to see it.

It was not moving, it just hovered above us. About 5 seconds went by, and then it shot across the sky towards the horizon. It looked just like a shooting star, with the trailing light following behind it. I remember expecting to hear a huge roar of an engine, but it made no sound at all.

My immediate reaction was that it had to have been a fighter jet, because we were so close to Ft. Knox. But, I quickly ruled that out, because, what explains the flash?  The flash was targeted right at us. The whole place didn't flash, just the small area around myself and my friend. Also, what plane can hover like that? A Harrier Jet can hover, but this object was only 250-300 yards directly above us and made no noise. Also, there is no plane that can move that fast. It had gone past the horizon in a fraction of a second without making any noise. That's what convinced me that this was no plane, missile, or anything man made. We woke a few of the older Scouts and told them what happened, but no one took us seriously, as has been the case whenever I bring up the story.

I know what I saw, and the fact that someone else was with me, and was able to recount exactly the same thing I saw, makes me truly believe that we encountered a UFO. Why didn't I go to the media if I was so sure? Because I knew there was no way of proving it, and this culture seems to dismiss anyone who believes in UFO's. But, I needed to get this off my chest.

I discovered I had the direction of travel of the craft incorrectly stated in the original report.  (It was going EAST, not West.)  I'm also adding the final paragraph which describes an corroboration from another location on the same night, only minutes after my sighting.

On Saturday nights, I sing onboard the historic Dixie, Indiana?s, oldest paddle-wheel tour boat on Webster Lake in North Webster, Indiana.  Weather permitting, I perform on the top deck of the boat which is uncovered. We have a clear, unobstructed view up there of the night sky.  

On 09-14-10  ((sic.  09-04-10)), the sky was mostly clear with a few light clouds here and there.  The sky was a sea of stars and there was no moon.  The day had been windy, but by our 9PM departure time, it was very calm on the lake.

At about 10 PM, we were emerging from a bay in the southeast corner of the 600-acre lake and were traveling west at about 5 miles per hour on the last leg of our tour.  I was just finishing a song when the captain of the boat tapped me on the shoulder and pointed into the night sky directly above the boat, calling my attention to a very strange spectacle.

An object was flying very slowly in a due east direction above and to the port (left) side of our paddleboat. It was so strange, I called the attention of the passengers to this object.  There were about 15 people on the upper deck, all of whom had a perfectly clear view of the object simply by looking up, and approximately 30 more on the lower, covered deck.  Most of those on the lower deck went to the port-side windows to stare up at the object.

I?m not very good at estimating heights, but this object flew above the spotty clouds at what I thought was no more than a few thousand feet.  The entire object appeared about the size of a dime held at arm?s length.

The leading edge of the object was a large, very bright red, glowing circular spot.  Immediately behind that was a rectangular light (about 3 times as long as the spot) which was an even brighter, orange glow which scintillated and looked very much like an open flame.  All I could see were the lights, neither of which pulsated or flickered other than the flame-like action of the orange ""body.""   We could see no wings or visible superstructure.  The craft was shaped like a fat, red-and-orange exclamation point travelling point-first. It left no smoke or vapor trail.

Some of the passengers said they thought it was a helicopter, a hang-glider, or an ultralight, so the captain stopped the boat and turned off the paddlewheel completely.  We could hear no sound of any kind from the object even though it was almost directly overhead.

We had the object in sight for at least a minute, but no longer than 2 minutes.  It continued due east, never changing its direction or rate of speed until it was out of sight of us (a mile or so east of the lake.)   I finished my show, and had a talk with the captain.  He said when he first saw it from the wheelhouse, he thought it was a missile, though he could not explain the large red, leading-edge light. Neither the captain nor I reported the incident.  I don?t know if any of the passengers did.

Four days later, I started to tell this story to some people at a retirement home where I was performing and immediately one of the employees came out of her office and told me that her son saw the same object fly over the airport (and air force training base) in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, about 40 miles due east.  I asked her to describe what he saw and his description was identical to mine.","Actor & Singer",50,1,"other",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2010,2010,3,9,22,"Night","Midwest",0,1,0,0,0

I have looked for years for a report on this matter. I?ve never found one. There were no reports of it in any major (or minor) newspapers in Nevada at the time that the event took place. I have recently, however, seen similar sightings listed that took place in different areas, so I decided to place my sighting here.

I was driving on Interstate 80, in Nevada, heading north, between Trinity Junction (where Highway 95 to Fallon intersects I-80) and Lovelock, in the Humboldt Sink.

It was approximately 7 p.m. but dark because of the date. I was driving a Ford pickup.

I was about 11 miles south of Lovelock on I-80 when I spotted a glow behind the mountains to the south of the interstate, approximately three miles away. The interstate here runs southwest to northeast for about 10 miles, so the mountain range, also runs the same direction.

The glow would sometimes grow dimmer, then brighter, but always like a ?moon? glow. It was incredibly bright.

I drove along the interstate, watching the glow moving eastward along the mountain range. No light appeared above the mountain range at the point, it just moved northeastwardly.

When it came to the end of the mountain range, it curved and started moving north, still keeping behind the next mountain range. I kept traveling on I-80, and it kept traveling just below the top of the next mountain range.

Approximately 10 minutes later, at Lovelock, I got off at the main exit, which I believe is exit 106, still watching the light as it traveled at the same rate of speed that I did. I got off the freeway and pulled over at the side of the off ramp. I stood up in the door of the truck and watched the light over the cab of the truck. I was approximately three miles from the top of the mountain range at this point.

The light lingered below the mountain tops for less than one minute, then suddenly rose up. The mountains in this range are from about 4800-6000 feet in altitude, and when the ball of light rose up, it dwarfed the mountains.

The only way that I can describe the size of the round light is thus: if the world were flat, and I was standing at the edge of the world, and the full moon was rising and taking up the entire horizon, that is how large this light would be. It was a lighter color than a full moon, but was the same size and shape. I cannot accurately state how large the light was, but judging from Google Earth and trying to estimate the size, it may have been up to one mile in diameter. It was certainly not much less than one mile.

As I stood watching it, small lights suddenly appeared around it. Small blue and red lights blinked off and on, moving rapidly around the giant ball of light. There may have been about 10-20 of these small lights. I cannot recall exactly. But they moved extremely fast.

Suddenly the ball of light descended back down behind the mountain and began traveling south, in the direction from which it had came. The little colored lights stayed above the mountain tops but moved along with the initial light. The ball moved, not rapidly, not slowly, but at about the same speed it had been moving during the entire time that I had been watching it. It traveled this way for at least one minute.

Suddenly a bright light flashed, like a gigantic arc welder lighting up the eastern sky around the light, a bright, electric-type blue light -- and the ball of light disappeared completely. The little colored lights stayed for a moment longer -- perhaps two or three seconds, and then they too just disappeared.

I have never shared this with the media of any type.

There is nothing located on the opposite side of the mountain range. Farther east lies the old mining town of Austin. There is a lot of military activity in the area; Fallon Naval Air Station is located within 50 miles. Shortly afterwards, I worked with a man who had retired from the Navy and after retirement had worked at the military base. I told him about the incident. He said the military could have missiles that could act like this.

But when I told him the size of the light, he became dumbfounded, and when I told him that the light turned around and changed its course, returning the direction from where it came, the only answer he had was ?the military doesn?t have anything that can do that.? Evidently, the  light?s ability to maneuver in this manner was something that distinguished it from a missile. And there is no missile that could be this large or act in this manner.

I have no idea what it was. I wish someone else had seen it. If anyone else did and reads this, I hope they respond so I don?t feel so alone.

Allow me to preface this by saying that I have always been a skeptic of things existing outside of our own world, understanding or knowledge base. You see, I am a practicing Physician, a licensed Medical Doctor, and with all my decades of schooling, I have always been taught to prove things with the Scientific Method, for otherwise, if they cannot be proven or repeated, they do not exist and hence, cannot be called a Law, let alone a hypothesis. My life changed dramatically, however, this evening; September 17th, 2010 at 3 am?the day I am writing this narrative.

  My dog was yearning to go outside. I had been awake working on the computer at the time, as I usually do my best thinking in the evening, and I did not have to report for duty the next day. Finally I said OK to my dog and we proceeded to walk outside and into the South-Easterly direction where we always begin our walks. The house faces East and we walk to the right and down our street. It felt about 60 degrees Fahrenheit. There was no wind or breeze at the time and there were no clouds or fog at all in the sky at that time. Less than 2 miles East is the Pacific Ocean. There are pine trees in our neighborhood and some reach 70-100 feet high. However, we had most of the trees removed from around our house due to a recent incident where a tree fell and caused massive damage to some structures.

  This evening, upon reaching the bottom of my driveway, I could not help be see a bright orange ?ball? in the sky in the South-Easterly direction. It was peering through a distant tree at the time, but it was so bright and beautiful that it could not be ignored. I stopped in my tracks and said aloud,? is that the moon?how could it be so bright or so orange when it is that far above the horizon?!? I moved to my right to get a better view from the street and without any tree in my way, but I did not need to move far as this light was moving?and fast! Within about 3 seconds I saw an identical light behind it, perhaps slightly smaller than the first. Mathematically, one cannot calculate their exact distance away from the Earth, their rate of travel, or their absolute size in space without having a known reference point, something relative to the object in question for reference, or some other known variables to calculate the equations in physics for time, space and travel. Both o! f these were traveling in the exact same path, the second appearing perhaps just slightly lower in the sky than the first. There were no sounds at all?no breaking of a sound barrier, no evidence of combustion or fuel consumption, and there was no sun or moon to be seen anywhere in the sky. These two VERY bright things were being lit-up from within, and not from any reflection or refraction of light. In fact, these were so much brighter than anything I have ever seen in the sky before, including the evening Space Shuttle and rocket launches that I have gone to see in the evenings of the past. I could not make out any specific structure, shape or entity, however, these two ?lights? appeared round in shape. I have taken years of Science classes, including Physics and Chemistry courses in college, and I have always taken what I would consider to be an amateur interest in Astronomy by taking elective courses in college, reading literature on the subject and watching scientific p! rograms that relate to our knowledge of the skies above. Note ! that I h ave no problem with my hearing and that I do wear glasses to see afar. My spectacles are always on when I walk my dog so that I can see if there are any wild animals in our path so that my dog does not chase them or get sprayed by a skunk! I had a flashlight in hand but I never turned it on.

  Naturally, I began to question myself??Is that a planet, a star, a jet plane, a rocket or missile or, because of its speed, is it a meteor?!? There was clearly no trail on either ?light.? There were no sounds at all?no cars, no planes, no thunder, no sirens or city lights, as I am in the woods here! All I could make out in the distance was a very slight crashing of the waves along the rocky shoreline.

  I have never seen this color orange, except maybe when I burned some certain gases and elements in the Chemistry labs. They were so bright (and beautiful)! Both were about the same intensity and hue. Again, there were no trails and no sounds emanating from these, or from my surroundings otherwise. I concluded during my observation that these were not meteors when the second ?light? went out for a period of 3-5 seconds and then came on again, just exactly as bright and intense as it went out! It did this two times before I ran to get my wife inside the house. How could a meteor burn out and then come back again just as bright as it went out, and with the same exact trajectory?! The skies were clear and nothing obstructed my view at this time. The second ?one? was actually following the course of the first exactly! The one in front stayed illuminated during my entire observation.

  I have NO questions in my mind in terms of ?what? I was seeing. Please note that I do not take mind altering drugs and that I was not half asleep at the time. I was able to see the clear sky perfectly with my glasses on, as they correct my vision well enough to see planets and constellations without a problem. On occasion I get a reflection out of the corner of my glasses, but this was no reflection! These 2 ?lights? were in the sky heading North-Westerly, at such a great speed and without a sound! I even peeked my eyes over my lenses to be certain that I was not mistaken in any way! It was total darkness and in fact, I had not turned on the front porch light and no lights or motion detectors from the neighboring houses were on or activated at that time. Further, there was no question that these were in the sky and traveling at speeds faster than I have ever seen anything fly across the sky before! This includes NASA?s Space Shuttle and the Blue Angel?s Boeing F/A-18 Hornets! at an air show when they make their final pass over the crowd!   I had to have someone else see this! I hesitated for about 25 seconds or so because I did not want to leave them or for them to go away or vanish without me witnessing it. Faster than I have ever moved before, I ran into the house waking my wife with a great sense of urgency. Within about 15 seconds, she was in front of the house with me but by then I did not see them anymore. So I told her to run and follow me alongside the back of the house, in the direction they seemed to have been going, and she did. She confirmed part of what I saw, however, below I will have her document her own experience of what she witnessed tonight with her own eyes! What I saw at that time, from the side of the house, was one bright orange light right through the dense tree that is growing in back of our house. Normally I can?t see a star, let alone a planet, through that pine tree on any other night due to the density of the needles on the tree! These ?things? were appearing to travel in a direct! ion over the Pacific Ocean and in the exact same course, or trajectory, where I would expect them to be if I were to extrapolate their path within the sky.

  In conclusion, this changed my life forever because now I know that just because we cannot prove something with science, doesn?t mean that it can?t exist. As a scientist, I want proof that whatever these were, they were either something created by humans i.e. the government or some private industry, or that they simply were not. Please! Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) is about 90 miles to the South of me, so I am most curious if they had any activity, documentation, recordings, launches or sightings at that time?3 am on September 17th, 2010. It is fresh on my mind and I shake when I type because I have never been so moved, perplexed , amazed and astounded in my life before?all at the same time! This defies everything I have ever learned and witnessed in my 44 years of life and wonder. I have seen the electromagnetic effects of the earth in the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) and this was nothing like that! As I search for an explanation, I know VAFB is not scheduled to la! unch the Atlas V until the 20th of September.

  Please recall that I witnessed two of these ?things? and that the one ?in back? flashed 2 times at about 5 second intervals during my direct and uninterrupted period of observation. There were no trails, no sounds and no vibrations of any sort. There was no fog, no cars, no clouds, no search lights, no ambient or direct lights and my vision was not impaired by anything for a at least a full 50 degree visual angle.

  Without knowing the height of these, the speed is difficult to calculate or imagine. If it was within our atmosphere, I would expect that the sound barrier would have been broken at that rate of travel. Above our atmosphere, even a rocket traveling at a thousand miles an hour could not cover this amount of distance across the sky in that period of time. And they were not going up. They were going across. There were no blinking lights nor any other colors that I could see. I most sincerely hope that somewhere the skies are being recorded at a telescope in California, Arizona or Hawaii that might have documented this event! Or perhaps someone else who witnessed something in the skies this evening will come forward with their independent observations just as I did. My patients may call me crazy and the scientific community might label me an outcast. But I am certain about what I saw and I can?t even conjure up an explanation for this based upon a scientific paradigm. Also, the ! probability of something like this happening to me again in my lifetime is negligible. Therefore, I was compelled to write this down and document it with the greatest degree of accuracy as soon as possible so that unlike a dream, this will never fade from my memory and nor will it become distorted over time or subject to any pressures of embellishment. I am thrilled that my wife got to see a fraction of what I did, but I wish that someone else could have seen this entire event the way that I did. Certainly there was more to it than just what I saw. But I am grateful that I saw as much as I did!   Thank you for taking the time to read about my experience. Having a lot of credibility to lose within the medical community, I would never put my career on the line to make up such a story, nor do I (obviously) have anything to gain from reporting this information. I simply want to share my life-changing experience with those who are curious or who have experienced unusual phenomenon in their own lives. But most of all, I hope this might bring some awareness to the scientific community that we are very likely not alone and perhaps this can act as a catalyst to raise more questions and trigger more research and investigations into finding out if there is a simple explanation for this?or not! My wife reports her brief encounter below. Thank you.

   On September 17th 2010 at approximately 3:00am my husband ran into the house screaming that I must come outside immediately. He did not say why. I followed him to the front of the house where he told me to look into the sky where I saw nothing. He then ran alongside the house, tripping on his way up the steps, where he pointed into the sky. I was on the 2nd step and I saw through the tree in our back yard, a VERY bright, large orange light. I took another step up the stairs and moved my head to the side to follow the light and I saw it without the tree in the way. The total time was about 3-5 seconds for me. It looked like it was going up in the sky and in the direction over the ocean. Then it was gone. I told him what I saw and he told me his story. They matched. We took a walk right after that with our dog for about an hour. We looked in the skies, talked about what we saw and we watched about 5 shooting stars within that hour of our walk. This color orange was unlike anyt! hing I have ever seen in the skies, both in terms of hue and intensity. It was as intense as that of the orange part of a blowtorch. It was moving fast. I can?t say if the light went out or it disappeared from my viewpoint.

We watched this object for at least  20 minutes. At that time, the lights became brighter, more intense and then it suddenly disappeared, it didn?t fly off, it was just gone.

While facing North (slightly to the West) towards Ventura, I witnessed the following:  In the distant sky, anywhere from 10 miles or further) a bright while light with various coloration changes appeared.  At first it appeared to be slowly rising on the horizion and then a long red and bluish flame shot out for about 20 seconds from behind and the white light turned slight and shot off toward a southerly direction.

Everything about the event appeared to be conventional except two things. First the way the object initially appeared in the sky did not appear to be conventional and secondly I cannot understand why the missile or craft would glow with a bright white.  After the flames were gone you could still see what looked to now be a bright white light disappearing into the night.  We see many planes and helicopters in our area at night and although the lights on the planes and copper are visible, the fuselage/body of the planes are very hard to see.  There were no notable navigational lights on the object either.

I was wondering if anyone in Ventura count saw this craft.  At first, I thought it was going to be some type of fireworks display and then when the flames kicked on it looked like a missile and for the record acted just like a missile.  But I am not aware of missiles that have glowing fuselages.

Me and my family were driving home from the showcase theater, approx. 5pm on RT.95 south (right near SUPER WALMART exit 7)and there were 2 objects in the sky.  They were about 3 miles apart, and they were creating a missile shaped tail.  They were just sitting there one looked like it was ""traveling"" east < and the other looked like it was ""shooting"" up ^ but it was getting closer and closer to the ground. We took a picture of them on the cell phone, but it is very small.  

This was not a plane. I have never seen anything like it.  I know there had to be others who were traveling on 95 south who saw this.

I was returning from the grocery store on Tuesday November 30, 2010 around 5:15 p.m. and saw what seemed to be a shooting star north by the mountains in front of me, however it was too low for that so I thought maybe it was a meteor shower. I drove home and unpacked and starting doing my homework.

 I live in Menifee CA and yes there are a lot of military helicopters out here and they usually do there runs by our house a few times a week lately it has been a lot more. I heard the chopper outside and something compelled me to go out and look. I went outside in my backyard and at this time it is about 6:00 p.m. I looked up and to the right heard and saw the chopper and then turned around to my left ( south ) and out of nowhere comes this huge black triangle shaped object. All lit up on all sides with white bright lights actually looked like one solid light all around, but after viewing the pictures it is hundreds of lights. It was making a constant low humming sound and was real low and moving slow. It was about 3 to 4 times bigger than my house!  At first I thought it might be stealth but living in AZ for 12 years in the past I have seen and heard stealth?s and they are loud. So I thought maybe this thing is the Aurora, but then I thought why would the military bring this out at rush hour traffic and dinner time?  It went right over me and kept on moving north down to all my neighbors houses. The chopper was at first in front of it about a half a mile just watching it then moved sort of beside it. Then they went in a circular motion and I just couldn?t believe how big this thing was and all lit up! I ran in the house and grabbed my camera I was able to take 2 pictures of it from the back side. Then it just kept moving further away, again at a slow steady pace. I have never seen anything like this at this close range. I am still a little freaked out but I think something is going to happen and they are here to protect us or warn us, I think we are going to war again real soon. They just shot the missile off from the sea last week here and yes I saw that too! I was driving home and saw the missile bright light coming down. Anyway I didn?t want to call the TV stations or anything because I think it would get dismissed as a military weapon of some sort but I don?t think it was military at! all.

I was driving to the store yesterday, it was starting to get dark. The horizon was just getting orange/pink, but the majority of the sky was still blue. So I'm driving and I happen to look up and see a large white/gray object in the sky. It looked like a blimp at first, but those are almost never around here and this was also an area close to an airport. What stood out was it looked like it was tilted on an angle, which didn't seem right. So I tried to keep watching as I was driving, passing by trees and buildings that would temporally block it from view, but it would always come back into view. When I looked away for a few seconds and looked back it was gone. This was a straight street too, driving right beside it. How could it fly/move away that fast when I was just looking there a few seconds ago? So I shrug it off and keep driving.

Then about 10-15 seconds later I look back at the same spot in the sky and see this small, but very bright white light with this weird, very short smoke/cloud stream behind it. It was just a light too, not a plane or anything and the sky was still very bright at this time. It looked like an extremely bright little star, but in a blue sky. So I'm still driving trying to watch it and come to a stop light and sit there. I look back at it and now the stream is completely gone, but it seems to be moving very slow in the sky, same with the blimp-like thing. It didn't fade away, it was like it was never there and now the light has gotten very dim, almost blinking out, then it does, but comes back a little brighter, then brighter then it blinks out and is gone all together and not a thing is in the sky there. Now I'm getting weirded out.

Now that it's gone I keep looking in the same direction trying to find something, but what I see now is the weirdest of the three. I see this large, flat, saucer/disk like shape in the sky. It was colored like a cloud, a very faint white, almost transparent color like it was trying to blend into the sky. This thing is very low in the sky, right above the treetops. I come to another stop light and watch it. It slowly moves from the right to the left behind some trees in the distance, then comes back to the right. Then I notice a second, then a third. All the same size and color, but the were in a wide triangle formation now. I'm almost to the store now, but trees and buildings are blocking my view so I hurry to the parking lot and park. It was a perfect view now. I sat there for about five minutes watching them move in the same area of the sky. Going back and forth, They seemed to fade away, then reappear. At times I would see only one or two or all three. They just seemed to! vanish on the spot and I couldn't see them any more and I went on with my business.

I counted them twice?there were five in total. I first thought it was a firework, then as it shot towards me, I thought it was a missile.  I was afraid at first, thinking terrorism, but then they stopped before me and seemed to dance around a bit. Three lights at first, joined by two more.   It was not like a big object, just these balls of orange, bright fire balls, not perfectly round.  There was low cloud cover that evening and as the lights went back up into the sky, we did hear an engine noise.

 I screamed for my husband and daughter. They both witnessed the event as well as my neighbor and his wife. Another witness was driving down our road, stopped the car and asked what the h*** is that? I called 911, but by the time the police arrived the lights were gone. They were in the sky for what I would say was about two minutes. No rigid geometrical formation?just almost like a dance.

I could not find ANY information on what was seen about 50 nm off the coast of Palos Verdes.  Please excuse me if I go ahead and just tell you about what was seen - even if it has nothing to do with UAP's.   

The few who were around me at the time, all witnessed a typical plume of a vapor trail which obviously looked identical to the one seen around Nov 10 2010 - off the coast here.  I watched it through the setting sun and thought it was simply a contrail of a jet flying from west to east and coming up over the horizon.  There was one prominent one and two other smallish 'launches' at the same time, with that spiral looking plume, contrail or vapour trail behind each.  They were very slow.  But really far off to the west.  It was quite strange to also note these long, far-reaching shadows that all eminated from the set-sun but it was these strange contrail-looking plumes that had cast the shadows across the sky.

I only want to know if in fact they were launches from somewhere west of us.  I CANNOT find ANYTHING ANYWHERE on the Net about this at this time.  Nothing said on ""Coast to Coast"", and can find absolutely nothing about it on the Internet (NASA, NOAA, and indeed on Google) - and it was MORE of a sight to see this time.

I stepped outside at about 1:40 am Est. March 30th 2011.  I go to my car and get my cigarettes.  I light one of them and get up out of my car and turn around.  And there is a Black pyramid/triangle shape floating above the back end of my neighborhood over the Fire Department and in front of a Water Tower...   The best way to describe it would have to be like a perfect symmetrical pyramid and/or triangle.  Like if you cut off the top of the Great Pyramid of Giza...

It was all black.  It made absolutely no noise.  It floated parallel with a major road in my town over the back end of neighborhood.  It was incredible?  There were 4 lights... there were 3 that were you know the normal white light on the 3 corners, 1 in each corner.  And in the center there was a red light.....

Now the only difference is the first time I saw this same similar object with my friend; the red light wasn't blinking.  On, March, 30th 2011 the RED light was BLINKING...  Not sure if it means anything. (I saw a similar object on a separate occasion with a friend, a few years ago probably 2 but in the same county) I called 911.  I have no idea if they took me serious or actually followed it up.  But, I was in shock just for the fact it was so close to my home.

Another example is if you look at the back of a One Dollar bill.  The eye in the pyramid-that is the closest thing I can think of, but the lights were on the bottom of it... but at the same time it was such a Dark Black that you could see the outline of it perfectly... and in my situation I had a humungous water tower as a backdrop and this thing just floated in front of it..

I stand by what I saw. And I also stand by the resume that my short life span holds... 4 years military (Active)... 1 year Iraq, 1 year Korea...  I?m now a Disabled Veteran.  Like I said I've seen many things from airplanes to helicopters to balloons and missiles.... and for the sake of the term UFO this was an Unidentified Flying Object...

Whether or not it is Alien or Extra Terrestrial I don?t know.  I know what I saw and I know it was a Black pyramid/triangle floating very slowly over my neighborhood heading towards Route 50 in the state of Maryland.  I will tell anyone what I saw.

I would have to estimate the size as pretty decent considering it bloated out a good portion of the water tower when it floated by.

I would have to say the incident lasted for approximately 10-15 minutes.

This sighting occurred in Easton, Maryland.  On March 30th, 2011 around 1:50 am Est.

The object looked like it came from the Elk Hills Petroleum Reserve.  For a couple of seconds it looked like it was still so I thought they were just burning off natural gas. Suddenly the object started moving from North West to a South East direction.  The object looked to be flying very low, starting at about 500ft then increasing altitude as it flew South East.  The object was not flying that fast.  At one point, I drove underneath the object.  As the object flew South East, the orange glow went disappeared but the object was still there.  After a couple of seconds of the orange glow disappeared, the object disappeared also.  I know how this sounds, but I can guarantee that this object was not an airplane or a rocket of any sort.

From my back yard a long, orange, very bright light was coming straight in my direction (south east). I think it was at an altitude of 5 to 6 thousand feet high but it was hard to tell. My first thought was that it was a large meteor streaking in the sky but it didn't look to be descending at all. I thought it looked like a meteor because it was the color of fire and very large.

It was totally silent. I ran across the yard and told my mom to ""come quick I see a UFO"". Before she could get out side the object changed direction from coming directly to me and started moving toward the west over the ocean. As it moved it began to diminish in intensity and started to move faster. My mom and I began to try to explain what it could possibly be but it was clear it fit no identifiable explanation. As it continued to move westward it began to blink out then it would flare up again. It did this 3 or 4 times then just didn't come back.

After it disappeared  my mom and I noticed that there was an unusually large number of airplanes in the sky. As we were looking around at the airplanes and commenting on the blinking lights and the differences from what we saw we noticed another strange light that didn't look like the other airplanes going almost directly over us heading north. As it got closer we noticed it was also totally silent and was a large triangle shaped craft (TR3-B I believe). We watched it continue slowly right over our heads and went directly over the mountains to our north.

At that time we both spotted a very large orange glowing light directly west of us approximately 800 to 1000 ft in the air. We both watched silently as it seemed to sit still for about 10-15 seconds. At first I thought it was a massive gas flare that we often see at the elk hills oil and gas facility.

I had realized that this object was too high to be a natural gas flare. The large round orange object appeared to be hovering above the southwest corner of the elk hills oilfield near the elk hills power generation facility.

 After sitting still for 10-15 seconds, the object began to gain altitude moving south east while it gained altitude. As it gained altitude the orange light got extremely brighter. At this point I noticed some vehicle pulling over to view the object. As we passed Elk Hills road the object was directly over us still climbing. The objects bright orange then faded to light orange then to a light blue. The object then disappeared. The object did not fade out, it disappeared in an instance. At the time the object disappeared we had pulled over on midway road and were looking east to see the object.

At approximately 9:20 pm (Pacific Time), I walked outside of the building I work in to secure some items in my car.  When I finished I turned facing west and I noticed a large unusually bright red glowing light just across the street over some buildings.  At first I thought it was an airplane light since the air traffic around here is pretty steady.  I quickly realized this was no plane; the light was extraordinarily bright, never flickered and seemed to be rapidly approaching me.  It was coming eastbound very quickly and it was very low.  I began to run towards it across the parking lot to try to make out what it was but the light was so bright that?s all I could see.

When I first saw the object it was a ball of light but as it came closer I saw it in its profile and it appeared as a long continuous red glowing cigar shape.  It was only about a football field away from me to my left and it was flying over the train yard located across from valley blvd.  I then noticed a helicopter flying westbound (I believe it was an Industry Sheriff helicopter) and the object quickly shrank back into a ball shape.  It was as if the object was playing chicken with the helicopter, I almost thought they were going to collide or that the object would attack because it was so low.

As the helicopter and object passed each other, the object flew over the helicopter and was probably less than 30 meters above it from my estimation, the object threw out a red almost force field like crescent moon shaped illumination towards its front end.  It completely lit the sky up around it and in doing so it revealed itself. It seemed like a ball of mercury, it was silverish and perfectly round.  The light shown for a few seconds and quickly faded into nothing although I could still see the circular object, as if it were driving with the lights out and there seemed to be very small electrical charges going off in front of it and I literally watched it fade into nothing.

I bet anything that the pilots in that chopper saw it too; there is no way they couldn?t have.  It was heading right for them and when it threw that red field out I know it illuminated the inside of their chopper.  So unreal I'm still in complete awe?

Two of my friends and I were playing basketball outside at a local church.  We looked up at the south south west night sky and noticed an orange orb.  It was 3 times bigger than commercial airliners that you would see flying at its highest point in the sky.  We watched it as it was staying in the same spot and then it started emitting a very small trail and a haze of orange as it started moving slowly east. It then instantly disappeared.  

A couple seconds later it reappeared instantly in the spot it disappeared.  Another couple seconds went by and it disappeared again instantly.  We never heard it making a sound during the whole 7 minute sighting.  We watched for another 30 minutes to see if it would reappear again but it never did.

We live in between China Lake military base and Lemoore Navel Air Station and see jets fly back and forth between bases all the time.  There is also a small airport near by and see planes landing. Commercial airliners fly over head as well between Fresno, CA and Los Angeles, CA area frequently.

We don?t know what it was.  It was a clear night with no clouds in the sky and a bright moon. Whatever we saw that night was not a plane.  It had no characteristics of the other planes in the sky like flashing lights or turning on white head lights on a descent to land.  Hopefully we could get some answers of what we saw.

At approximately 2100 hours I went outside and looked west into a clear evening sky.  Visibility was excellent.  There was a ? moon overhead.   I was looking WSW and saw, approaching from the west, two sets of lights which I assumed were transiting aircraft as this area is a busy air traffic corridor.  Flight separation between the two was approximately 2000 ft.  I quickly discerned that the lead, faster moving object was NOT a normal aircraft.  It appeared to be a slow moving meteor.  There was a bright light emanating from the nose and a whitish orange fan-shaped ""tail"" coming from the aft of the craft.  The movement was steady to slightly accelerating.  I figured the craft was at 2-4 thousand feet AGL.

This strange craft overtook the other set of lights which was, by all appearances, a small general aviation craft such as a Cessna 172.  I say that by the pattern of the anti-smash lights and the familiar drone of the engine and also the approach path as it appeared inbound to the local airport.

I continued to observe the ""slow meteor"" as it approached and noticed the fan-shaped tail took on an orange to greenish hue.  If my guess to altitude is correct I?d estimate ths corona-like tail was 2-3 hundred yards in length.  The fan shape of the tail was oriented vertically and the width of this plume was narrow.  The color was something like mixing a sodium vapor lamp and the color of copper being burned.  There was no pulsing or flashing.

After 10 seconds of watching, and as it approached it seemed to accelerate and begin ascending.  Then the nose and tail lights extinguished.  I SAW the object at CPA (I was facing due South at its closest point of approach).  It was no more than a mile to the south of where I stood.  It was small, dark and obloid, or, football shaped.  

Suddenly it emitted a brief puff of hazy orange light and accelerated to an incredible speed while slowly ascending.  It was out of eye-sight within a quarter second after that.

It made no sound.  This was unsettling to me as I would have expected to hear it as this mountain pass area traps and funnels noise quite readily.

The total sighting lasted 20-30 seconds.  I have to assume that the general aviation pilot saw what I saw and I?m writing this in hopes of corroborating stories.   If it WAS a meteor I?d like to report an ascending meteor.

A little background on myself:  I was a Naval Aircrewman for 21 years.  I flew in several airframes and have thousands of flight hours of experience.  I?ve seen many strange things while flying and my share of meteors.  I am not taken to having flights of fancy.  I was fatigued but sober and otherwise in a calm state of mind.

A older report, but had to report as it has been bugging me ever since, afraid to report at first.  I swear on all my grandparent's graves at what I saw.  May god strike me down if I am lying.

I was walking southward that evening down my steps in my backyard, didn't see anything odd, but felt compelled to look up.  Right when I looked up, above me, saw a huge, giant glowing rectangle above me very high up, perhaps stratosphere, no clouds.  Hard to say how huge but, I think it was very, very high up, seemingly as high as the stars, but I think stratosphere.  Massive, at my sight, from my perspective, at it that high up it was 3 or 4in long and 2in tall.

Object was itself bright and glowing, not sending light out, but itself only, no reflective light, as if it were some energy light.  It was 3/4 left side fluorescent white, glowing and fluorecent blue 1/4 on right side, perfectly, vertically seperated by a line of both colors glowing as one.  Hard to explain.  It flashed brightly, and disappeared, then in a fraction of a second before I could think about what I was seeing, it reappeared to the left, or south, about 6feet from my perspective, but obvioulsy quite a far distance that far up. I yelled to a friend to come out and see, I wanted to tell him to grab the camera, but didn't want him to miss it.

In the interim, it flashed again, and again, reappeared to the left of it's position as it was moving southward.  Just before my friend arrived at the outside door, it then flashed again, dissapeared and then a giant sphere of fluoresecent white light, brighter than the moon (which I could not see that night, tall redwoods around me), brighter and bigger than anything I have ever seen, other than the moon, in the night sky appeared almost like a super nova, glowed brightly and then shot off like a bullet to the west, over Big Basin State Park, flying above hwy 236.  The rectangle had gone, it seemed as if it became the sphere after it flashed the third time.  

My friend missed the whole thing, a very short period of time elapsed, but much happened.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, our B-52's, KC 135's, and U2 planes formed a net around Cuba in the air, and the navy at Roosevelt Road controlled the seas.  Transport troop carriers were parked on the taxi-way ready for drop on missile sites in Cuba.

At 5:30 a.m., while waiting for relief on the taxi way, I noticed off in the distance over the Caribbean Sea an usual cloud, with flashing lights within it.  My canine flight and I watched and radioed each other to try to figure out what it was, because the trajectory of the cloud was headed towards the no fly zone.  The relief arrived, and we were picked up and driven across the active runway, still watching the object headed towards the parked B-52's alert area.

When we arrived at the armory within the restricted area, the cloud was there.  It was drifting thirty feet above the ground, approximately 6 feet thick and 30 ft in diameter.  Dark swirls of clouds and lights swirled around the object.  The only thing that was visible were the lights spinning inside the dark swirling cloud like a carousel. Green, orange, yellow and blue. 

Our entire alert crew came out of the mole hole to watch.  There were many mechanics, other flight crews and airmen observing as well.  

The object passed us and headed towards the U2 hanger, which was strictly off limits.  My only concern was that nobody shot at whatever this object was.  We all had our firearms, standing there watching it until it disappeared.

After the incident I went off duty for 3 days leave.  Nobody told me not to talk about it.  

The only person I told was my mother.  After the Ramey Airforce Base was decommissioned, I told my sons.

I want to preface this with the fact that I have seen this same kind of object ""patrolling"" the tree line in another area of this same town about a week before this incindent.

While visiting people sitting outside,I saw this silver or white object flying rather low in a straight line over the residence I was at and I immediately pointed it out to everyone.  It looks like a missile with no wings and it makes no niose, it flies slowly through the sky in a straight line.  This particular object flew toward the treeline untill I could not see it.  

About 2 minutes later the same exact thing happened! I do not think it could have been the same one because I dont think that the original object had enough time to get back around from where it started from and start over again in just 2 minutes.  

We tried to get pictures of it but they are not very clear. 

After this one went to the tree line again, the same thing hapened 3 more times!  The last 2 times the object was still flying in a straight line but it was focused on other areas, once it went straight across the middle of the sky untill out of sight and another time it went towards the tree line in a completely different path from the first 3 times.  Again this makes absolutely no sound, no contrail, no wings, no tail. Its as if it is a drone with no wings patrolling the area.

I was at my granddaughter?s softball game and happened to glance up at a dark cloud above and slightly west of me.  I saw an object which at first I thought was a high flying eagle but I saw immediately that the object was stationary and not changing shape.  It was dark colored and I would describe the shape as a boomerang with squared off tips.

I was about to draw my wife and daughter?s attention to the object when it started to move and appeared to dive.  After a second or so I realized it was not diving but moving away to the west at an incredible rate of acceleration.  It stayed below the cloud level as I could see it until it disappeared behind the golf course tree line to the west of the ballpark.  All of this occurred in less then ten seconds.   The object did appear to change shape but I am not sure if it really did or just appeared to as it moved away at a high rate of speed.

I have been around civilian and military aircraft all of my life.  My father was a flight instructor and I spent 4 years in the USAF and 28 years in the Montana Air National Guard as a civilian technician.  I am very familiar with military aircraft and I can tell you for sure that this was not a military aircraft.  I have never seen anything, with the possible exception of an air to air missile, accelerate at the rate this object did.  If I was going to guess at the rate of acceleration I would say this object went from stationary to well over mach 1 in about 3 seconds.  I would estimate that from the time the object started to move until it was out of my sight was less then 5 seconds.   The object made absolutely no noise and there was no sonic boom.

I live in Gouverneur, NY near Fort Drum.   I?m 44 and I?ve lived here all my life.  This sighting occurred as I was riding my motorcycle home from Watertown Tuesday, July 19th, at approximately 10PM.  I was traveling north on US RT 11.

As I approached a the crest of a hill outside Evans Mills, NY, I saw a string of 8-10 orange horizontal lights appear from east to west in the north northeast sky ahead of me.  I would say the elevation was roughly 35-45 degrees.

Upon first notice, I assumed these were flares being dropped by some type of military aircraft, as this is a pretty common occurrence at Drum.   Two observations made this incident a little different, however.  First, if it was an aircraft, it displayed no lighting whatsoever and was utterly invisible from my location. The only indication of its presence was the afore-mentioned trail of 8-10 tightly-spaced orange globes that appeared ""behind"" it.

Second, while what I saw were similar in appearance to military flairs, they didn't drop, emit smoke or have the halo usually characteristic of flares.  They just appeared, one after another, in close horizontal formation, then disappeared after maybe 30 seconds in the same order in which they appeared.

I saw 3 or 4 groups of these lights appear and then disappear.  The whole incident occurred in what appeared to be a broad west-southwest counter-clockwise arc in the sky over the road I was on.  To continue the clock analogy, if I?m riding towards 12, the lights started at 1 and, in 3-4 groups of 8-10 lights each, arced to 10.  This took maybe 3-5 minutes.

I slowed my bike to watch the show, and a car in front of me had also slowed and pulled over to watch.  I did not pull over.  I was traveling around 30-35 miles per hour throughout, and was wearing a half-helmet.  I could hear nothing such as a helicopter or airplane.  Also, I read a report from someone on a bulletin board who claims to have seen something similar near LaFargeville, NY, around 11PM.  That?s about 20 miles from where I was.

 It was probably military, but it was certainly unusual.","Bookkeeper",0,0,"unknown",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2011,2010,3,7,22,"Night","Northeast",0,1,0,0,0

On 31 Aug 2011, this investigator was meeting an old USAF buddy at the Klamath Falls, Or. airport as he was flying in from Portland, Oregon via Dallas/Ft. Worth via Tulsa, Ok.  This witness was on vacation in Oregon for a week.

Upon arrival in Klamath Falls, Oregon... this investigator was surprised to hear that his old USAF friend had witnessed a UFO about an hour out from the arrivial at Portland International Airport.

The following is the email that was sent on 14 Sep 2011 by the witness;  (WITNESS EMAIL; UFO was flying SE @ about 30,000 ft. at an incrediable speed, was white in color and elongated like a missile shape maybe 100 ft. in length.  Sitting on right side of plane and saw UFO to the right and below me approx. 1 mile away at about 4pm.  Skies were clear with some clouds UFO entered clouds and vanished from sight.)   Because of the time change, this would have been 3pm Mountain and 2pm Pacific time.  This investigator spoke in depth with the witness, who was not only a USAF veteran of 4 years as a firefighter, but a former city police officer from California.  This investigator also served 3 years with witness in the USAF at the same base.

Some addtional information. Witness was flying in from Dallas/Ft. Worth on American Airlines flight 453 which was to land in Portland, Or. at approx. 3:05pm.  Which would of put the time of the sighting Pacific Time about 2pm. Witness was amazed at the speed the object was traveling, which would of been SE to his NW direction of flight.  His duration of the sighting was about 4-5 seconds.

This investigator showed the witness a still photo of the Salida, Co. UFO. Witness confirmed that his sighting was simular to that incident, as far as shape and color.  Witness stated that the speed was too fast for any conventional aircraft, including military.

This investigator calculated Flight 453 was flying at an estimated speed of 500-570 mph which at the time of the sighting, the witness was over the Idaho/Utah border just north of Salt Lake City, about 500 miles from Portland, Oregon, plus or minus 100 miles about in the area of Interstate 84 and 15 at the Idaho/Utah border.

Investigator also noticed from the UTAH map, that the Utah Test and Training Range was also in this general area, as well as the Dugway Proving Grounds.

My husband and I were driving east into Bardstown, and were coming into the City Limits and over a large bridge they have built as you enter the town.  It was a clear day in early July and the sun was still about an hour or so from setting.  We had a nice view of the town skyline from the bridge.  All of a sudden there were three separate fireballs in the sky that actually appeared to be explosions; they did not appear very large (but I assume that is due to the distance we were in comparison to the fireballs) and were not closely grouped together (one appearing in the far southern direction to our front and right, one directly in front of our position, and one towards the far northern part of town to our front, left).

I blurted ?Did you see that!?? to my husband, to which he said kind of confusedly ?Yeah, what the heck was it?? I mentioned that it appeared to be explosions and suggested that we call the small airport (which was directly west of us) or call the police and tell them, thinking that it may have something to do with a distressed plane.  My husband thought this was kind of silly, because we had seen three fireballs, not one.  There was no smoke, no sound, just three simultaneous round fireballs and nothing more.  There was no indication that there was any aircraft in the sky, much less crashing after an explosion.

We considered the possibilities of the fireballs being someone setting off fireworks; however they were spaced too far apart to be the same person doing so, and there was no sound after the fact, not to mention that they happened perfectly in sync and were spaced miles apart.  They also seemed to last just a small fraction longer than a mortar shell that you purchase for the 4th of July, as well as they happened much higher up in the atmosphere.  We are from this area, and we see fireworks set off into the sky every year over the town; that was not what we witnessed with these three things.  They did not occur again, and we watched for quite some time while in town (we were in open air for several hours after arriving, so we had opportunity to watch the sky).  I never heard reports of anyone else witnessing this, even though there was at least one vehicle driving into town ahead of us facing the same direction.

These were three fireballs, like you would see in a movie were missiles are exploding in the air.  Perfectly round, perfectly timed simultaneously, and made of orange fire.  The sky was clear, then suddenly, three fireballs, and then there was nothing more.

Mr. Davenport, 

 I was a participant in an air force attempt to intercept a UFO in 1962. This happened at the headquarters of Washington air defense sector, (Washington DC not state), on a swing shift in October.

Three height finders reported a stationary object at 70,000 feet altitude.  I was working in the height section of the WAADS direction center when the first radar operator called in a report.  I thought it to be a balloon, but he said no because it was completely stationary and a balloon would be drifting with the wind.

I called the other two sites and told them the reported location, and they promptly saw the object on their scopes as well, same altitude and stationary.

I notified the commanding officer in the weapons section and they decided to scramble two interceptors to go take a look at it.

The object remained stationary until the two interceptors got close to it, (maybe two miles for the lead aircraft).  The lead pilot said it was a bright round object.

It then took off straight up and fast until it went above the altitude capabilities of the radars and was lost.  Of course the interceptors were unable to follow.  About forty people were aware of this incident on that crew at WAADS.

The surprise to me was that we notified no one of this incident and were told to ignore it. The commanding officer said ""who would we report it to since we are it.""  This attitude was and still is most illogical unless the CIA, or somebody, already knew what it was.

I am sure it was not any aircraft manufactured by humans because it exceeded the capabilities of anything we have ever made.  Surely our government would want to know what that was so why ignore it.  This attitude frightens me now and did then because I can only come up with bad reasons why the government would show no interest in something that was obviously real like that.  That was a group of reliable witnesses including the pilots and the radar operators as well as everyone on that crew.

Have you any idea why our government would pretend that no verifiable evidence has ever existed for a UFO other than they already know what they are or why they ridicule any report anyone is foolish enough to make?  By the way, I do not wish to report that event but it did happen.

((END E-MAILED REPORT)) 

((BEGIN ADDENDUM FROM SAME SOURCE))  

Mr. Davenport,  

Thank you for responding to my message.

No, I do not wish to file a report.  No, I do not remember the name of the commanding officer.  I do remember the names of some of the crew but I have had no contact in forty years or more.  It would be difficult and costly to verify my story and I am not trying to prove anything.  You are free to believe whatever.  But here are a few easily verifiable facts.

The object involved was first spotted by a height finder radar operator.  It was his job to insert altitude data into a remote computer terminal as requested by a computer located at a central site or by me verbally over the voice line.  He could only see an area about ten miles wide but from the surface to about 110,000 feet and from his site to a distance of about 200 miles away on his scope.  He noticed the object while getting an altitude on a commercial airliner as requested by the central computer.

I was an enlisted man in the 26th air defense command stationed in the only air force squadron at Fort Lee, Virginia.  Fort Lee was an army post but the direction center for the Washington air defense sector was located there.

The field I was in was called SAGE for semi-automatic ground environment.  It was an air defense system which consolidated radar data from sites located all around our sector into a central computer where a composite refined display was presented on CRT?s ((cathode ray tubes; screens)).  A crew was necessary to handle the non-automatic part of the job.  Each crew member sat at a console where buttons and a light gun were used to perform actions assisting the computer.  The hardware was a very large IBM computer and the software came from System Development Corporation.  There were 20 odd such direction centers, if I remember correctly, and they were connected to each other and to NORAD.  Our responsibility was for an area which ran from north of Washington, D.C., to South Carolina, west to nearly Ohio, and out over the Atlantic.  Each direction center had responsibility for a similar sized area.

At that time, I worked in the height section, where I occasionally obtained altitudes on aircraft for the weapons sections practice.  The computer automatically obtained altitudes, but only at five minute intervals.  I talked to height finder radar operators at the radar sites when a manual altitude was needed.

There was also a weapons section, a tracking section, an identification section, a manual inputs section, and a Nike missile control section manned by the army.  I know that the direction center no longer exists, and probably all of the rest of them are gone as well.  I suspect that it was all consolidated to NORAD, when better computers and systems were created.

No, I am not a liar or a hoaxer.  I just would like to know what that object was and what the government is hiding.  I have no other agenda.  Specifically, since some say the world is ending on 12-21-2012, I wonder if the government has been informed by aliens that the Mayans were correct.  That would certainly explain why they act the way they do.  Of course I do not believe that Mayan story.  But it is an example of possible reasons for their actions.  I can't come up with a noble reason.  I just suspect that the government is hiding something.

Why bring this up now?  Well, I saw your site on the internet and thought you may know the truth.

Thanks again for your response.

At approximately 9:00PM PDT on August 3rd of this year, I was taking pictures of the sunset and crescent moon as I regularly due.  As I was reviewing the photos on my Canon G2 Powershot Digital Camera, I noticed that I may have captured the first stars of the evening with the moon.  This turned out to be a big problem though, when I returned to the deck to look for the stars, there were no stars-which should have been brighter by that time.  Next, I went to the computer to do some analysis.  What I saw on the screen was amazing.  Two disc shapes, weird squares, large moon like objects, and also a triangle-missile shaped UFO. Alan Fergason mentioned on Coast to Coast that he didn't see very much until he went to the computer to look, as was my experience, I saw nothing through the viewfinder when I snapped the shot.

I took 12 shots of the sunset that night, some have nothing odd, others some, but on IMG_054 the ufo's are are amazingly vivid.

It took me some time to believe what I was looking at, until I it coupled with the strange camera battery situation I experienced while taking the images.

While taking these photos, my battery read close to dead, even though I was sure it was fully charged.  After reviewing the photos I checked my camera again and it then again was fully charged.

Something really weird is going on, I'm sure of it.  I'd appreciate if you would help me analyze these photos further.  I've included the original and some blowups.  I have a PowerPoint poster too, which makes it easier to track and identify the UFO's.

Clear bright stary summer night in Southern California, Two 11 year old Friends sleeping in a tent outside in their backyard which was a frequent practice without airconditioning.  Observed two circular spheres flying in formation from the San Gabriel Mountains in a southernly direction towards the area of San Dimas and La Verne CA.  Watched as the spheres stopped in mid air and hoovered at an elevation of about 25,000 feet.  Both spheres were yellowish orange.  No beams of light emitted off of them such as a search light or night running lights.  They were both brighter than the stars in the background and appeared closer then the commercial aircraft preparing for their final approach to LAX.  These spheres could not have been mistaken for airplanes, helicopters blimps or balloons.

As we gazed at this abnormal activity we talked back and forth describing our observations to one another.  We both noted that the distance between the two balls of light was approximated at 1/4 to 1/2 mile.  Geographically measuring their proximity I would estimate that one of the spheres was hoovering over the Metropolitan Water District Plant in La Verne and the other was over Puddingstone Reservoir in San Dimas.

After approximately 30 minutes, the most southernly sphere (San Dimas) flew away over the Ganesha Hills Mountains and then in a Northern direction closely following Garey Avenue in Pomona towards the San Gabriel Mountians near Mt. Baldy.  The one sphere over La Verne stayed longer and then proceeded straight back towards the mountains from which it came.

Naturally, the next morning we reported our observations to our parents and friends who half heartedly believed us as neither of us were ""story tellers.""  That afternoon with the paper arrived, our creditability was boasted by several sightings being re-told in the local newspaper.

3.  Almost immediately four similar lights appeared, at the same moment, further south from the second triad (which were still in the sky).

On the night of July 30th, 2011, at approximately 10:30 PM, my son had gone out to the backyard.  He came back in right away, and told me to hurry and come outside.  

I hurried out, and he pointed to the sky and there, in the West, was a long line of round, orange lights heading straight toward us.  There had to be at least a dozen to 20 of them.  They were in rows of 2-4 each.   I told my son to run and get his dad, because he's a skeptic, and he'd never believe it if he didn't see it for himself.  He came out and witnessed it too.   

It was exciting, yet scary too, because my first thought was we were being attacked, and those were missiles.  But as they got closer, I could see that they weren't missiles...they were round objects, that  moved slowly in formation...all at the same pace, and they never moved out of that formation.  All of them were the same size.  

There was absolutely no sound coming from them, and no flickering lights as they passed over us.  The sky was clear, with the exception of one small whispy cloud over the house next door.  Every one of those objects went into the cloud, and never came out.  There were openings in that small cloud, and we didn't see any of the objects pass by any of those openings.  

When it was over, I tried to find out if anyone reported the sighting, but only one news station answered, and she said they were short handed and nobody reported it.   I went back outside to check the sky, and the cloud was gone as well.   It was very frustrating!  I was kicking myself for not running into the house and grabbing my cell phone to try to film it.  I was afraid if I went to look for my phone, I'd miss the event.   I don't know how high up the cloud was, or how low the objects were, but those objects had to be really big if that cloud was very high up, because they weren't  small dots in the sky.  They were a good size, and appeared to be  close.","Retired",3,12,"circle",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2011,2010,3,7,22,"Night","West",0,1,0,0,0

I witnessed something tonight that I still have a hard time really accepting, but it is what I saw and it was really amazing, to be honest.

There was (I have no checked to see if it is still there, it hadnt left when I had..) a rather bright object in the sky, that was pulsating / flashing various colors.  Blue, red, whites, greens, yellows. All colors, similiar to that of a twinkling star.  I initially felt it WAS a twinkling star. No movement, just oddly large and had VERY erratic color movement, it would dim out completely and come back at times. So I called my father down to see it, and as we watched, we saw  a jet off to the left of the object.

Bear in mind this was at 9:00 pm tonight here in Bellingham WA, so we couldnt actually see the jet, just the red flashing wing light indicating its presence, and occassionally its green light. We noticed it was flying below but towards the object.. and as it was about to pass, it did a very dramatic curve up towards the object, and as it did it left a trail of very bright orange behind it, like that of possibly afterburner? Or even missile trail, although it trailed behind the craft so my guess is afterburner, and I mean this thing did a sideways U shape in the sky back towards the object. As it did the jet itself was rather bright, I am not sure why this is, perhaps just the light off it. The object reacted however, this was the first time it moved. It veered fairly quickly to its left, meanwhile the jet retracted and headed back towards us, which was parallel to the direction it was originally heading, which we found quite odd. It flew nearby and passed over, and the objec! t remained in the sky. We noticed other jets circling the area, but none of them appeared to engage, rather one of them turned towards us and again flew over head, the other I am not sure where it went, I lost it in the nights sky.

I try to remain skeptical, but I know my aircraft, and I know what I saw.  No commercial airliner is going to pull that U in the sky like that in the first place, and the fact it did it to go directly at the object...?  That's just too much to over look.  I stayed for awhile longer, but w/ nothing going on besides the objects rather beautiful pulse, I went back inside, it was freezing out.  To most my story will be crazy, or they will come up w/ an explanation..  But nothing explains that jet doing what it did in regards to the 'star', and the ""star"" MOVING.  That was a RUSH to watch, I was in complete amazement.  My father was dumbfounded as well.

Sorry, long story. But it's just something incredible to me.  I wish I could've seen more, or own a camera (I do have a cell phone, but its ancient, it cannot record video...) and wish more people would've seen it, it seems like people are sometimes oblivious to what goes on in the sky above them ?","Heavy machinery Operator",2,1,"sphere",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2011,2010,4,12,21,"Evening","West",0,1,0,0,0

I was using my telescope and looking south I saw flashes of light, much like lightning, and thought there was a fire or maybe explosions.  Then one of us noticed the light, I pointed my telescope at it and it was a teardrop shape with many colors: blue, yellow, green, red and orange.  

It appeared that there were missiles being shot at it, about nine at a time, and the light would evade the missiles and hover again.  There were about five volleys of missiles shot.  There was the sound of jet craft coming from the north. 

They were hiding in the mountains so that they could not be seen but we could hear them.  There were three distinct squadrons of jets that went to intercept the craft.  They went by about five minutes apart.

Eventually we saw the light start to dodge the jets; they had finally appeared some 80 miles, a guess, away.  The light finally went behind the mountains and away from view.  

We watched the squadron follow the craft and a few minutes later we saw a cigar shaped light descend from the sky and start to follow the jets to the west until it too disappeared behind the mountains.

I was exiting my apartment complex to check the mail approx. 7am.  I was having troubles sleeping all night so figured a quick breath of air would be pleasant.  Due to the time change for daylights savings it was still dark out.  As soon as I stepped out of the building, in the skyline ahead of me was a flashing very very fast orb.  It was at a distance in the sky and high up so the shape was unclear but if I didnt know better I would have mistaked it for an airplane, but its speed was just way too intense and the colors flashing were just strange and not at all of aircraft.  

It passed over and a patch of trees blocked my vision. I ran out quickly to get a better look beyond them and it was gone.  I tried to ride it off and treked to the mailboxes.  Just out of paranoia, I looked up from there after retrieving my mail and cursed myself because again, I saw a strange distant orb/circle crossing amongst the stars.  It actually looked like a star, a dull gray orb not f! lashing like the other, but it was speeding along in the same manner.  It wasnt a shooting star because it didnt curve, it kept a steady streaming pace. Then as it passed by a very bright starlike object a tad bigger, it stopped, and moved BACKWARDS towards this star or whatever, and disappeared it seemed INTO it.

Strange Incident Near Conrad ICBM  Most Recent Sighting,  One of Many at Nuclear Bases  BY ROBERT HASTINGS   

When I lecture on UFOs, I am often asked, ""When and where was the most recent UFO sighting at a nuclear weapons site?""  Given that these incidents are ongoing, it's entirely possible that such a sighting occurred at one missile facility or another very recently, perhaps even last night.  However, as far as I know, the last reported incidents apparently took place near Conrad, Montana, in December 2006.

On December 12th, an indivi-dual, not identified, posted an intriguing sighting report on the National UFO Reporting Center website.  It seems that the previous night, while driving home, the anonymous source had sighted a UFO just east of Conrad, Montana.  Moreover, according to the post, he also had another sighting, four days earlier, at almost the same location.  Although there was no mention of nuclear missiles in this report, I knew that the town of Conrad is literally surrounded by Minuteman missile sites.  

On a hunch, I contacted NUFORC's director, Peter Davenport, and requested the source's name and contact information.  Davenport then contacted Ryan Riewer, now a student at the University of Montana, who readily agreed to speak with me.

In a telephone interview, Riewer told me,  ""I live on a farm nearly three miles east of Conrad.  On December 7, 2006, I was driving home from work at around 10:30 at night. I was on Sollid Road, probably a mile away from our house, when I saw this light out of the corner of my eye, coming from the southwest. It was the fastest thing I've ever seen. It came racing up almost to the road. It stopped dead for a moment, then took off at a 90-degree angle to where it came from. It went southeast, over a hill on the horizon. A couple of seconds later, it came racing back toward me. Then it began to slow down and descended toward the ground at an angle. When it was about fifty feet up, the light shut off. It looked like it landed about a half-mile, or maybe a mile, from our house. That was really, really weird.?  I asked Riewer if there was a missile site in the area where the UFO apparently landed. He seem somewhat surprised by this question but confirmed that was indeed the case. ?Yes, there is a missile silo out in that direction. I saw it one time when I was hunting with my dad,? he said, ?I would say that the distance between the missile site and where the object landed was about a mile.?  Riewer continued, ?Four days later, on December 11th, I was driving home after work again when I saw an extremely bright light in the sky, dead east, directly in front of me. As soon as I got home, I looked at the light with binoculars. By then, it was southeast of us. I saw blue lights on top, a red light on the bottom, and a white light in the middle that kept moving around. I couldn't make out the shape of the object, just the lights on it. My mom looked through the binoculars too.

The object remained stationary for half an hour or so.  I would estimate that it was two to three miles southeast of our house.  Then the lights shut off and I could no longer see them.  About five minutes later, I saw another bright light. It looked exactly the same as the other one.  The second object was the about the same distance away, but dead south of us.?  Riewer continued, ?I put down the binoculars and called the sheriffs office.  The person I spoke with just said, 'Thanks for reporting this.' He acted like it was no big deal. There have been lots of reports of weird stuff going on around Conrad. He had probably heard other reports like mine, so he wasn't too excited about it. After I got off the phone, I looked at the object again. By then, it appeared as three red lights in a triangular pattern. After a few minutes, the bottom right light shut off. Then the bottom left light moved up to join the top light. All of this took place over a half an hour or so. Then these lights disappeared too. After a few moments, I noticed another object farther off in the distance, north of where I saw the first light. It was northeast of our house, but dimmer, and I couldn't see it too well. About a half an hour later, it was gone.?  After speaking with Riewer, I consulted my large, Air Force-issued map of Malmstrom's Minuteman missile sites and discovered that the Papa Launch Control Facility, designated P-0, is approximately 2 miles north by northwest of his family's farm.  I also found that the boundaries of three 564th Strategic Missile Squadron flights?Papa, Quebec, and Sierra?all converge nearby. According to the map, Launch Facility S-40 is approxi-mately 2.5 miles southeast of Riewer's house, and Launch Facility Q-15 is approximately 5 miles northeast of it. Riewer's estimate that the object southeast of his house on December 11th was ?2 to 3 miles? distant seems to place it in the vicinity of S-40, while the dimmer object sighted northeast of his farm was conceivably near Q-15, although that is less certain.

I asked Riewer if he had heard or seen military jets either near the objects or in the general area during either sighting. He said that he had not. I then asked if he had noticed any unusual Air Force activity on the ground immediately after either sighting. He responded that he had not.

When asked if he had seen other unusual lights or objects in the sky on other occasions, Riewer  replied, ?Yes, one night, maybe a year or so before my other sightings, my step-father and I heard what sounded like a helicopter flying really low. It was really loud. We went outside to see what was going on. We saw what looked like a helicopter, but really high up. That was puzzling because we expected it to be close to the ground. It was so high we could only see the lights on it. Then another helicopter came into view. The two met up and just stopped in the sky, really close to each other. Then the noise quit and both of them were silent! By then we figured they weren't helicopters. Then all of the lights slowly faded away, like they were going out. They just disappeared. Those two objects were southeast of the house, in the same general direction where I saw the other objects [on December 7 and 11] and about the same distance away.?  Riewer continued, ?I mentioned my sightings at school and got laughed at, but one of my teachers backed me up and told us about his own UFO sighting, which happened while he was out hunting. After that, some other students got brave and told us about their sightings. So I'm not the only one around Conrad who has seen things.

In his posting on the NUFORC website, Riewer had mentioned that a mutilated cow had been found on his grandparents farm at the end of October 2006. He told me, ?My step-grandpa and grandma have a farm near us, five miles east of Conrad. About a month or so before my sightings, a neighboring rancher had his cows grazing on their land and one of them was found mutilated. Its genitals were missing and the skin on one side its face was peeled off. As far as I know, that was the last time that kind of thing was reported in the area, but cattle have been found that way [on other occasions] in the past.?  According to the Montana press, cattle mutilations were first reported on ranches around Conrad, and elsewhere in Pondera County, in the mid-1970s. Then, after a nearly-three-decade lull, more mutilated cows and steers began to be discovered in the county beginning in 2001.

Robert Hastings, author of UFOs and Nukes, Extraordinary Encoun-ters at Nuclear Weapons Sites, is a researcher and lecturer who has interviewed nearly one hundred U.S. Air Force veterans involved in nuclear weapons related UFO incidents.

Note: At the time of their experiences, the former or retired USAF sources who Hastings interviewed held positions ranging from nuclear missile launch and target-ing officers, to missile maintenance personnel, to missile security police. The incidents described and documented occurred between 1963 and 1996 at the following  Air Force bases: Malmstrom (Montana), Minot (North Dakota), F.E. Warren (Wyoming), Ellsworth, (South Dakota), Vandenberg (California), and Walker (New Mexico, aka: Roswell). Other sources were stationed at Wurtsmith (Michigan) and Loring (Maine), where B-52 nuclear bombers were based during the Cold War era.

In 1966-67, when Hastings? father was stationed at Malmstrom, and during the time of the reported UFO activity at the nearby Minuteman missile sites, he witnessed five UFOs being tracked on radar in the air traffic control tower (having befriending a radar technician). The incident led to his decades long project and documentation of UFO inci-dents related to nuclear weapons sites. A portion of that documen-tation includes reports from at least six former or retired USAF personnel?Minuteman missile launch officers stationed at Malmstrom in 1967 who divulged their knowledge of UFO involvement in two separate, large-scale missile shutdown incidents. Despite the testimony of missile launch officers, the United States Air Force formally denies UFO-involvement in the officially acknowledged missile shutdown incident at Malmstrom AFB. The official disavowal is found in the 341st Strategic Missile Wing?s ?unit history.?  Significantly, according to Hastings, the unit historian, Dav! id Gamble, reported that while compiling material for the official history, he had learned of reports of UFO activity within Malmstrom?s missile fields. When he made inquiries, Gamble received ?no cooperation? from those in-the-know. He further said that written changes regarding ?the UFO aspect of the missile shutdown incident? had been made by superiors. The final version of the unit history states, ?Rumors of Unidentified Flying Objects around the area of Echo Flight during the time of the fault were disproven.?  Hastings presents his findings to colleges and universities nationwide and encourages former and retired military personnel to contact him regarding UFO  incidents related to nuclear weapons launch or storage facilities (email: hastings444@ worldnet.att.net).

I am not sure of the exact date, but it was around the first week of February 2012. I was out fishing in my boat and it was approximately 1:30 am .The temperature was around 38 degrees with a clear sky. I like going out on cool nights because I have such a great view of the sky and often see quite a few meteors every time I go out.

Fishing, something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. Coming in from the NW part of the sky was a seemingly very unusual meteor traveling in a SE direction. It was seemingly very, very big, was traveling in what i thought was an unusual trajectory and was moving extremely slow for a meteor. If I held my arm out at full length, my thumb would have just covered it up. I didn't at the time, but it seemed as though I could have counted to 5 easily as I watched it and it was coming in at maybe around a 15-20 degree angle. It looked like a perfectly round shaped ball that was a very bright white color, but instead of fading out as the myriad of meteors have that I have ever seen, this seemed to get brighter as it got closer. I would guess now it just seemed brighter because it was getting closer ? I would imagine it was much further off than it seemed, but when it was seemingly over the town of Estill Springs, it looked like it exploded into a thousand bright pieces,! but the pieces did not fade away or dim, they were just there, then they weren't.

I honestly thought I had just watched a nuclear missile coming in on an EMP burst. I waited for all of the lights to go out but nothing happened. I sat there for a good 5 minutes wondering if I had maybe just watched a plane crash etc.

Now looking at the, about 5 minutes after the first one, a 2nd one started coming in on what seemed like the same trajectory and path. Again it moved very slow, was the same size and repeated exactly what the 1st one did - seemingly over the town of Estill Springs exploding.

Okay I thought, the first emp blast failed and this was the 2nd attempt. Again the lights stayed on and i had all kinds of things going on in my head trying to figure out what i was witnessing. It just seemed so strange for a meteor, unlike anything I had ever witnessed.

After about 20 minutes with everything seeming normal, I went back to fishing. About 10 minutes later, keeping an eye on the sky, I saw a third bright round ""ball"" coming in from the same part of the sky only this one seemed much higher up. Again moving ""slowly"" like the others, it traveled in a south easterly direction only this one went much further south. If I had not seen the first 2 I probably would not have been able to understand the ""explosion"" as it was much further away.

I came home the next morning and told everyone I knew that I had seen the strangest ""meteors"" in the sky.

Maybe a month ago, reading Coast to Coast news, I saw an article about a ""flaming fireball"" over Georgia on I believe February 14th I believe. Apparently a woman saw something very similar to what I had seen over a small town in Georgia. The scientists said what she had seen was a very unusual meteor that came from the meteor belt and described it as a ""rare"" event.

It made me wonder if that was what I had seen because the time could have been right and the 3rd ""ball of light"" seemed to me like it would have been in that general direction.

So it was probably the ""flaming meteor"", only it was described as rare and I saw 3 of them in about a 40 minute time span, 2 of them seeming to take the exact same path with the 3rd traveling further south east.

I was in the army on tanks and have seen my share of missiles and rockets (peace time warrior, a section sgt in a calvary platoon) and i would have to say whatever it was, it was the coolest thing i have ever seen. Just seemed to travel soooooo slow for a meteor plus if anything, instead of dimming it got brighter as it came in.

Peter,  I just caught the end of your interview on coast to coast last night but I have herd you before. My question is do you have any interest in old reports?   I had an encounter in 1963 with my brother and the next door neighbor, I was eight at the time but still remember it rather well.   I also have a sighting five years ago with two disk and I know a man locally with a sighting.

The one with the local man here is interesting to me anyway, he is now into refrigeration repair on businesses.  This story was told to me while we were having lunch together and we got to talking about jobs we had.  He had a small aircraft parts delivery business and mentioned he was a security officer at Malstrom AFB just north of us here in Great Falls Montana when he got out of High School.   The interesting part was I asked him about his time there and one thing lead to another.  His job was to watch over the nukes, he was called out to investigate a alarm.  When he showed up with his partner they noticed a glowing 10 foot diameter object over the concrete top on the missile.  They watched it for 20 minutes when it moved toward town, he said they could keep up with it till it got to the other side of town.  He them radioed in and two jets were sent and he could still see the craft when the jets went bye with after burners on.  He was later told to be quite about it but was told ! the craft was clocked at 4000 MPH when lost over Belt Montana.  He is a rather religious guy and when I asked him if he thought there were alien he said that stuff is B.S.  He did tell me he thought they were Russian crafts because this happen in the 1970's and the Russian's were watching us.

My mother and father live on a hill side in eastern KY.  My mother, father, sister and I were sitting on their front porch on a very clear, sunny day.  My sister first noticed a bright light in the sky and grabbed the binoculars to look.  It was visible with the naked eye.  She said it was flat cigar shaped -disappeared in thin air. I blew it off as a balloon or plane.  The object reappeared within minutes and I was the one to witness it appearance.  I asked my sister if she saw it and within seconds of asking her it disappeared.  Few minutes later we were baffled at what it was.  At that moment my sister and I saw two objects appear. One was super bright as if the sun was reflecting off metallic. My mother saw it at that time and said it was had to be bright due to her poor vision. My father and I looked through the binoculars and could see that it was cigar/missile shaped.  My sister also described it as flat and cigar shaped, bright silver in color.  One ! light drifted off and disappeared as fast as they appaeared.  There were several jets in the sky leaving contrails.  These objects left no trail at all. Just appearing and disappearing in thin air. One did move slightly as if in flight but would disappear! Very strange, all four of us are confused at to what we saw.

In the Northwestern sky, I saw what I thought was an aircraft coming over the horizon.  Based upon the location, I assumed it was military as the coloration was different and appeared in the same vicinity from my vantage point as Moffett Field in Mountain View, California.

Upon assent, it was apparent that the object was a missile of sorts as it had a distinct amber trail.  As it climbed in elevation, the relative perceived speed provided a clue the object was much further away that originally thought.

It appear to reach the upper atmosphere and the object's propulsion begin to lighten in intensity and then disappear.  I then asked two family members to witness the remaining two launches.  I believe this was probably launched from a vessel at sea given the distance.

It appears the path was due South from a launch point somewhere near the Farallon Islands.

I don't believe this was extra terrestrial, just some sort of military testing however I can't believe I would have been the only one seeing this as there was plenty of commercial and private aircraft traffic airborne at the time.

A friend and I hiked to the top of Arthur's Rock in Lory State Park (Fort Collins, CO).  After reaching the top, we heard a whooshing noise (described by my friend as sounding similar to the noise she heard incoming mortar rounds make when she was deployed to Iraq).  We looked up and saw a small black round object coming at us from the southwest.  It is hard to say how big it was because it happened so fast and we do not know how far away it was, but we think it was maybe 1-2 feet in diameter.  It was on a perfectly straight downward-angled trajectory and was moving MUCH faster than a bird could possibly fly. It passed over our heads, possibly within 30 yards or less, and continued down towards the road we drove in on.  We expected to see an explosion or puff of dust, but we never saw an impact.  It appeared to change direction and curve slightly upwards, and then we lost sight of it.  My first thought was that someone shot a missile or RPG at us; my second ! thought was that it could have been a meteorite.  But I would expect to see an impact from any of those things.  I think we were very lucky we weren't knocked off of the rock!  My friend and I are military officers (medical).

At approximately 10:15 p.m. on 06/02/2012 I noticed a large orange yellow globe rise over the horizon.  I  live in Cranberry Township, PA and it is a hilly area of Western PA.  My first thought was that it was a hot air balloon on fire.  As I looked it was followed by another.   I called my husband and we both grabbed cameras.   By the time the event was over, we observed about 10 of these orange fire balls go over.  They were headed in a straight line, flying ENE from Pittsburgh.

We strung a few of our videos together and put two videos on YouTube.  One is labeled ?Missiles over Pittsburgh 06/02/2012? is probably the best one.   The other ?Cranberrytwpufo.qt?   A search in YouTube should bring them up quickly.  The Missile one has views from both my camera (I tried to do close-ups) and my husband?s cell phone video where he captured the things passing near the moon so you can get some perspective.

They were going fast, and we heard no sounds from them, although a helicopter did fly by while we were out filming.  I really think it was a jet squadron being moved, but maybe someone can look at the pictures and see if that makes sense.  We?ve all seen planes fly at night, but I?ve never seen 10 or so round glowing fireballs go over.   I suppose it is possible that up until now I?ve never seen a group of military jets fly across the night sky at high altitude on a mostly clear night.

I have read a written description from someone driving in Kentucky at the exact same time that most closely describes what we saw.   In fact, numerous google searches for the evening of 06/02/2012 ?ufos? turned up about 4 sightings that I would consider identical to ours.  They ranged from Illinois to New York, all occurring at the exact time (the one in Illinois is listed at 9:15p.m. CST).

Just thought I?d share.

It was about 5-7 feet away when it started to rise.  It was not a tracer bullet as it was much larger and slower and there was no sound.  As it rose, it picked up speed and was quickly out of sight.

((NUFORC Note:  Lens flares, we believe.  PD))","At least two objects, possibly emitting light in UV range, are captured by camera in night sky over Yerevan, Armenia

Late in the evening of June 11 my son took photos of night Yerevan from a hill. When he then transferred the photos from camera to computer, he noticed that camera captured something in the sky that he did not notice when taking the photos. On two of the photographs this ?thing? looks like a ?falling star?. On other two photographs (taken after the first ones) the object seems to be closer, its shape is unclear, probably the object itself is not visible, but it has a bright blue ?tale? of conic form, reminding exhaust flame of a missile""  When I examined the full-size photos, I discovered that there is a second object in the upper middle part of the photos ? its blue ?tail? is visible. The orientation of the two are different. Then, near the first (bright) object, a small blue stripe may be distinguished (marked by an arrow on enlarged fragments of the photos), indicating that probably there is a third object farther away.

The pictures have been taken with 1-2 minutes intervals between them. The exact times are: 21:29, 21:30, 21:31, 21:33, 21:34, 21:34, 21:35, 21:37, Yerevan time (UTC/GMT +4 hours). The photos are taken with long exposition time (10 s for the first two shots and 5 s for the rest), without a tripod (that is why some of them are quite blurred). The camera is Panasonic Lumix DMC-Z50. I have made some processing of the enlarged fragment with the second (farther) object (Curve adjustment in Photoshop) to make the object more distinguishable. However, if you look at the screen in a dark room, the object is visible without any adjustment on a full-size photo (this is how I discovered it).

You can see some yellow-white bright spots that are above the city, but these are of no interest - there is a high mountain behind the city (mount Ararat), and these are the lights of settlements on the mountain.

 Another thing which is very important, is that when my son was staking the photos of the city, he did not notice the objects. He noticed the objects only when he was looking at the photos afterwards. Either he was too busy with making the photographs of buildings, or... the objects were hardly visible for a human eye! (not so bright to catch the attention). The second assumption is supported also by the fact that there were many people at the spot, who also did not notice the objects. Initially this seemed very strange to me, but then I made some search and found, that modern digital cameras are sensitive to UV light, and they catch it as blue (this is the case also with Lumix DMC-Z50 - that is why it is recommended to use a UV-filter when shooting outdoors in sunny weather, otherwise the images will have blue haze). So, from all these I assume, that the blue ""tails"" of the objects we see on the photos were indeed in UV range, and were invisible, or almost invisibl! e, for humans. It is the camera properties, perhaps, together with long exposition time and high intensity of UV radiation from the objects, that made it possible to see the blue ""tails"" on the photos.

Later on I found another UFO report that supports this assumption: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88222.html (a blue moving spot appeared on the photos of the sky but was not visible to photographer).

And, since the objects were not observed ""in real time"", we, unfortunately, cannot say anything about their trajectory, when and where from exactly they appeared (though this can be guessed from the first photos, where the object is smaller and(?) farther), and when and, most importantly, how they disappeared.

 If there would be only one object, then I would probably be sure that this is a kind of rocket or missile or jet plane, but, in my opinion, the fact that there are more than one objects (with different orientations) makes this unlikely.  For the same reason (the presence of the second object), it is, in my opinion, unlikely that this is a kind ""light reflection"" (from what and how?), as many people told me.  Next, the presence of air wave (I am not sure that ""air wave"" is the correct term though) in front of the object (if we assume that the blue part is the ""tail""), which is visible probably because of heating (or ionization?) of the air, suggests that the object moves in the atmosphere with high speed.  But, from the other hand, we see it almost in the same position in the sky on the two photos taken approximately at one minute interval.  This can be, in my opinion, if the object is very far from the observer.  And hence, it (they) should be huge i! n size.

Two large unknown objects ascended through the night sky off the coast of Palos Verdes, California around 23:45 on 4 July 2011. Our party of four had just finished watching the fireworks display in the southeast night sky over Long Beach, Ca from our backyard patio. A few minutes had passed when our attention was diverted to the southwest portion of the sky.

Given that it was the Fourth of July, we merely thought it to be a floating lantern, or possibly a large flare someone shot up off the coast. It appeared to be rising from somewhere between the southwest tip of the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Catalina Island and we were able to calculate that it was rising over White?s Point, San Pedro - on the Pacific Coast (roughly lat:33?42'42.78""N, lon:118?19'7.09""W). Expecting it to explode like the fireworks cascading the night sky did throughout the day and night, we watched it intently with anticipation.  We believied it to be one final spectacular display since the major firework shows in the area had ended within the last hour. Yet,this object was moving at a steady pace - not as though it had been shot out of a cannon, and grew larger in size as it came into view. When said object did not explode and rather, ascended higher into the night sky -we realized that this was not a fireworks display. We also realized that this a! rea of the coast does not have a fireworks show. From our vantage in our backyard in San Pedro, the Palos Verdes Hill blocks any view of the firework displays in Redondo Beach and north through Manhattan Beach.

When we first noticed the object it appeared as a perfect triangle. We referred to it as a ?Golden Pyramid.? Its coloration was a mixture of gold, orange, red, yellow and appeared to be pulsating within itself - as if it were on fire. Said object rose into the night sky to a point where it was clearly too high for visibility. It ascended in a straight line for about 6 minutes, made an arc north for about 4 minutes, then continued to raise straight up into the night sky where it became a small pinprick of a light. It then appeared to shoot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  The reason we knew it not to be a firework was because the glowing and pulsating was contained within the shape of the triangle - there were no trails of sparks of flame leaving the triangle. For example, when one views images of the sun from space, it has flares shooting out from it?s surface. This object had the same appearance, but all was contained within the shape of the triangle. It also neve! r fell in altitude. If it were a balloon, flare, or firework - they would all pop and descend in an obvious manner. This object did not. Weather balloons also do not glow in the manner we witnessed.

The four of us were flabbergasted and kept asking each other what we saw. Only a few minutes had passed when yet another object emerged in the same spot in the sky as  the previous object. It was larger than the first, but matched coloration and appearance. What solidified that the first object was not anything we have ever seen before, the second object followed the same exact course over the same exact amount of time, rising into the night sky until it was no longer visible.

We attempted to film the object on our cell phones, but a combination of light pollution from the street light over our backyard and low resolution on our camera phones made it impossible. A few minutes after the second craft had disappeared into the black of night, a night flying Cessna airplane flew over roughly the same area the first UFO appeared.  We determined this was the altitude private planes must fly and that the first ?Golden Pyramid?  appeared much higher in the sky.  A flare was shot off in the southeast corner of our visibility - toward Long Beach - and we concluded this object was nothing close to a flare.  These were two solid reference points for us to analyze what the situation was.

Both of the crafts appeared, and rose into space.  Plain and simple. Maybe they were watching the fireworks as well!  There is no firework that could follow such behavior patterns, and there has not been any man made craft that the public has knowledge of that would accomplish such feats.  We researched rocket and missile launches in the area, and we came up empty handed for that date.  All we know is that we all saw the same thing and hope to find someone else who witnessed the same thing.  I write this review so late because I barely found this site today, but feel the need to share what the four of us saw in the night sky that evening.  There is not a single day that goes by where I forget about this experience and my life has completely changed since then.","Student",4,2,"triangle",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2011,2010,3,7,23,"Night","West",0,1,0,0,0

It was about 2 am my lights inside my mobile homed started to dim & to the point of such a low power state I could hardly see inside the home.  I went outside to see & check power pole & noticed street lights were at same power state, so low that they went off.  

Living out in the woods where I lived there are several other homes & mobile homes on the street.  Normally a lot of dogs in the area always barking, with the woody area, & river close by, frogs and other noise makers as usuall.  Well this night was different, all went quite I mean nothing was making noise & if it was, it all stopped.  When I noticed a slight hum, a very weird hum, like a washing machine on spin dry but not that loud.  

When I looked up I could see a dark object, triangle in shape, huge!  I would say football field lenght in size. No lights, no blinkin lights, nothing.  The only reason I saw it was because the moon was not quite halffull when it got blocked out of view & stars as well.  Moving slowly from east to west towards the perdido river.  My girlfriend, her brother & myself all seen this.  Not sure if anyone else in the area did.  I reported this to MUFON, I guess a week later.  

Well a month went by when I took vacation from work & was barbequing on grill late afternoon I noticed the strangest damn thing.  All the tops of the trees, about the same width of the triangle thing we saw, had turned brownish & wilted, more wilted than brown, you could see the pine trees just looked sick like if u don't water a plant enuff or you water the leaves & put it in the hot sun & they wilt.  But it was fall so no way it was from weather.  2 days into my vacaction, 3 vehicles come cruising down the road which dead ends & we all know each other so veh not from residents, 1 humvee, & 2 chevy suv's all with white gov.  Plates.  

They got out, took pics of trees, that I saw as well.. they where in the area for about 2 hours. I went up to the two that got out of the suv they were dressed in blue coveralls like flight suit lookin military clothin! g no nam es on clothes but patches on side on velcro lookin spot on upper arm what looked to be lighting bolts with I think a missile between the bolts, I think the numbers were 38th, at least that's what I think it was. 

Anyway I asked them are they here because of the low flying craft 3 or 4 weeks ago?  They looked at each other & told me what craft, I went on explaining what I saw and what i thought caused the trees to welt.  They told me no that's not what caused it & it was a fuel release from an aircraft that had problems, which was a damn lie cause fuel would have been all over the trees falling from sky not a straight line.  I didn't argue with them of course & they asked me my name & address & who all was with me, & I'm like why would u guys want to know all this if it was a fuel release from airplane? They said In case of sickness or medical complications they told me.  But why didn't they ask rest of neighborhood? Some guy called me from MUFON about 6 months ago but not sure if he was who he said he was..

My sighting took place in an urban residential area in the west side of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  I was returning home about midnight driving my VW Beetle.  I turned into the subdivision from a main thoroughfare.  At the first stop sign, I sighted a spherical object about a meter in diameter hovering in the middle of the residential street about a half a block on my left.  I turned left in order to approach the object which was in the center of the road and suspended about 10 feet above the road surface.  I approached slowly and got within 60 feet of the sphere.

 The object was bobbing like a cork on the water and was emanating light from its surface.  The light consisted of brilliant colours that seemed to rotate around its surface.  I remember red, blue, orange and yellow patches of light rotating in a random fashion all over its surface.  My impression is that the light was actually photons being emitted by ionized air molecules as the colours were very pure like laser light.

 I crept slowly forward observing the object through the front windscreen.  When I got within 60 feet the object began to react and drifted with a bobbing motion toward the far side of the road.  It went behind a small tree and between two adjacent houses.  I could see the light being reflected off the aluminum siding of one of the adjacent houses.

 I quickly drove to the end of the block and turned on the side street to go to the next street over to see if it was still visible.  As I turned onto the next parallel street, it was once again hovering in the middle of the road at about the same height.  This time I approached at a little higher speed to see if I could get closer.  The object reacted by once again moving between two adjacent houses in the direction of the third parallel residential street.  I quickly moved around the block to see if it would be in the middle of the third street.  Sure enough it was, once again hovering in the middle of the road.  This time as I rounded the corner it took off at about a 20 degree angle at an astonishing speed.

 I have witnessed night time artillery firing trials where the projectile from the artillery piece was a tracer and the speed of this object as it left was much quicker than an artillery round leaving a cannon.

 I heard no noise at all during this encounter but of course the engine noise of a VW Beetle is considerable.  However, the departing speed had to be several times the speed of sound and there was no sonic boom.

 Since this incident, I and my daughter have both experienced some unexplained night-time events that neither of us can explain but where untraceable blood was found on our pillows and sheets.  These incidents happened at several different residential locations over the course of a couple of decades but have now stopped.

July 27, 2012: Note: Phoenix, AZ time.

At 8:30 P.M. on the 27th of July, 2012, my husband and I were walking our dogs and saw several UFO?s at the end of our street. We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert At 8:30 P.M. on the 27th of July, 2012, my husband and I were walking our dogs and saw several UFO?s at the end of our street. We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert in North Phoenix near Cave Creek, AZ. and always enjoy the view. The mountains and horizon looked like a postcard and the horizon was purplish blue.

As I gazed up at the sky, I noticed that there were a lot of trails crossing the sky. In fact, the sky was full of them. And there seemed to be a gigantic X in the sky where two of the largest ones crossed each other. My husband and I thought that this was very odd indeed. On further reflection, it seemed that the X marked a meeting spot.

Then we noticed that coming from the north, very high in the horizon, what appeared at first to be a plane was not a plane at all. It was soundless, for one thing and moved erratically.  I could not believe my eyes. It jumped around sporadically in a fashion that no plane is capable of doing. As it jumped, it blinked, and then it hovered, waiting. Why was it waiting?  Then we noticed that an actual plane ( or what seemed at first to be a plane) was some distance from it but seemed to have some connection with this object as well as the other unidentified flying objects. This first one would not continue on its path until the plane- or what appeared to be a plane- turned off its lights. At that point, the object flew in a southernly direction in a slightly more normal path though at no time did any of them have the noise of a plane.

This happened several times. We saw seven of them, and they did not all appear to be exactly the same though they all did act in an erratic fashion. Some had orangish lights and some had greenish lights. Some were bigger than others and seemed to have lights that blinked as if they were  rotating discs. The smallest of these were more cigar or bullet shaped and the size of a plane, but two seemed to be much larger. One was in the shape of a triangle. We watched fascinated.

Before we left, one of the very largest ones first hovered and then headed in the opposite direction. It first headed closer to us and then followed us across the street like a low flying plane above the trees which made me feel quite uneasy indeed.

Except for the last one, we lost sight of all objects over the horizon or they seemed to just disappear.

Also, while this was going on at one point we looked at the moon and it was clear. Five minutes later there was a distinct trail across it- like a long line. There were no lights moving in the area. If it was created by a chemtrail in the area, then the flying object had no lights as we saw nothing saw cross the moon.

It is odd that they all came from the same exact place and seemingly from out of nowhere.  We watched them as they appeared. My husband  now suggests it was perhaps from the area of 51 Las Vegas. They all headed in the same direction ( seemed to be Goldwater Preserve SW of Phoenix). We could not identify any landing. One flew back to the point of origin, inexplicably. The rest, five, continued on out of our sight except for the last one which followed us.

It seemed to be a convoy mission of some sort ( some escorting others into the area that they were all headed).  The ?plane? that shut its lights off and then on from the object waiting to make its flight seemed to be giving it a signal to pass.

Also, not only was their behavior bizarre (hovering and stationary and then deep ascents or descents), soundless, and erratic, but they appeared to have come from a much greater distance than a plane possibly could. When they first appeared, they seemed to be brighter than the brightest star, so perhaps that gives some indication of size and distance. It seems as if they came out of thin air and were at first at a much greater distance. In fact, at first they looked star like, then like several  bright points that jumped around a bit( to get stabilized?) and then, coming closer (it appeared) into our atmosphere, you could detect some type of shape with lights (green or red) at the bottom of the unidentified flying object.  They all moved noiselessly unlike planes and were able to move in a manner unlike any plane. We did not take our eyes off of them, but I had the creepy feeling with some of them that they were trying to approximate the look of a plane once they began to f! ly in the same southwesterly direction.

However, planes do not shut their lights off or hover and come to a standstill, planes do not come out of nowhere as far away as a star then jump in inexplicable patterns, and planes do not fly noiselessly.  I was not sure whether or not they actually changed their shape or the shape came into focus as it came closer.

I was traveling south on 34b and had just gotten out of the 35 mph speed zone, i was maybe a 2 miles away from King Ferry when my van just died no lights no engine, my hands are bad because of the work I do so i had to lean up to try and start the van.  When I leaned forward is when i saw the bullet shaped craft slowly floating by.

I looked out my drivers side window and had a direct line of sight at the side of it, there were no markings on the side of it any where.  My 1st thought for whatever reason was to look for any markings that were USAF, it was only the height of a electric pole above me and slightly behind me.  It was a light color white/gray maybe white/blue i can only be sure it was a light color.  The thing that has stuck with me since the sighting is, the bottom of the craft it had 3 seperate panels that were all lite with a white light.  The panels were the entire size of the bullet shape craft, each panel though was seperate. It also had wings on the sides and to me only looked to be maybe 3 feet tall in total.

Never have really understood what i saw still don't but, the entire craft was the length of the chevy custom van i was driving at the time.  After it floated off far enough my van just magicly came back to life engine was on as well as the lights, and i was gone as was as my van would go really freaked out.

The part of real estate that happened at is nothing but farm land, was always curious if farms ended up with missing animals during that time.  Another thing i almost forgot was this thing was completely quiet and unreasonably low as it traveled.

My seventeen-year old son and I were on the deck of a cabin we?re vacationing at on the south side of Crystal Lake near Frankfort, Michigan. Shortly after midnight we observed a bright orange light coming from the west, growing larger until it stopped a third of the way up the lake between two trees and hovered for about a minute. Then it slowly moved east over the horizon and shot like a bullet straight north over the horizon, disappearing into a small dot and then disappearing altogether in well under a second.

It was impossible to guess how large it was or how high in the sky it was, though it appeared to be at about the same height a helicopter might fly. It was obviously not a star, an airplane or helicopter, or any ordinary light. It appeared to be moving deliberately, and it was completely silent, which is especially notable on a lake where sound carries very far.

I?m combining two reports into one because the next night, 7/15/12, at approximately the same time, my son and I were out on the deck observing the stars and joking about how funny it would be if the light appeared again, when out of the west, it did.  This time it hovered long enough that by the time we absorbed what we were seeing, I had time to remember that I should go get my cell phone and take a picture.

Before I could, the light flew quickly back to the west out of sight within a fraction of a second, was followed within 2 or 3 seconds by a slightly smaller orange light that hovered in the same spot in the middle of the lake for a minute or so before it shot west out of sight.  All three lights that we saw were close to the same size but appeared to get larger as they advanced towards us to hover   I would say about half the size of a normal full moon at their largest, and maybe just slightly oval but mostly round.

My son and I are both in agreement about the details of what we witnessed and that whatever the light was, its movements were unlike anything we?ve ever seen before and not explained by any known aircraft, satellite, or other typical explanations for an unidentified object/light in the sky.

I am from the west side of the mountains, north of Seattle. I am a 52 year old male.  I attended Wenatchee Valley College and then attended Eastern Univ. in Cheney, WA.  My major was Audiology and that's my occupation currently.  It was 1992 when I started at Eastern and I put a year in when that horrible winter of 1992-1993 took place.  At that point I decided for a change due to the record breaking winter conditions, and since I always wanted to live in Hawaii after spending time there in the Navy, I sold my truck and RV and moved to Kauai.  I attended the two year school in Lihue working towards my degree and while there I befriended a gentleman who taught at the college.  As he learned of my living status he offered me to look after his aunt's house who was hospitalized with a stroke.  I ended up spending a year in Kauai and moved back to Spokane to finish up at Eastern.  But before I left the ?Garden Island? the year I spent there was the most fascinating year of my lif! e.  And not solely because of what I'm about to share with you, but also just from the people and the Hawaiian way.

It was October 17, 1993, about 2 months after I arrived to Kauai, which my friend the math teacher and I were returning to his aunt's house where I was staying.  I still remember the time; it was about 6:00 pm and a beautiful Sunday evening.  We were sitting in the driveway chatting before I was getting ready to go inside the house.  As I was talking to my friend the math teacher, who was to my left in his driver's seat, I noticed in the corner of my eye something strange.  As I turned my head to the right looking outside my passenger window I saw a light ball traveling fast above me through the clouds.  It looked artificial maybe 6 feet in diameter traveling very straight and whizzed right over us at a good clip. It looked to be about 500 to 600 feet up coming at us at about 2 o'clock. I only got a short glance at it this time, but I noticed it certainly was not a meteor because I could tell that it was artificial traveling at a rather at low altitude very straight.  There w! as no burning tail and it was close enough for me to get a very good look at it.  So then I turned to my math teacher friend and said ?I just saw something very funny looking.?   So as we continued talking about, it then it appeared again about a minute later and having rolled my passenger window down this time I stuck my head out and saw it very clearly.  Again, it came at us at about 2 o'clock but this time I saw it turn a 45 degree turn then another 45 degree turn and took off at 10 o'clock right over the town of Lihue.  It was still daylight and even though it was simply a light ball traveling through the sky, it looked very very strange to see such a thing especially in broad daylight.  It made no noise and when it turned those 45 degree turns it didn't slow down at all and turned on a dime.  It looked like a big round lighted glass ball being remotely controlled at about 500 feet up.  Then we then got out of the car and my math teacher friend, who is a rather small sta! tured Japanese Hawaiian man, started joking and asking me if I! had bee n drinking.  He did not see this thing at all because he had a big bush along the driveway on his side of the car which blocked his view.  So at that point I went into the house and my math teacher friend took off for home.

When I got into the house I realized what I just saw was not anything we have.  It had no wings, it was just a lighted glass ball traveling rather fast through the Hawaiian sky at about 500 feet up, and turned twice on a dime like something I?ve never seen before.  Again, when I saw it coming at us from 2 o'clock it then turned 45 degrees from 3 o?clock and then straight to 9 o?clock then turned another 45 degree turn and took off at 10 o'clock, and of course the times are a reference of direction.  So now I'm in the house thinking wow! What do I do now?  S o I called the local am radio station in Lihue which was only about 5 blocks from the house.  A Hawaiian lady answered and I asked her if she had received any UFO reports.  She asked me if I was into ?astrology? joking a bit, and I said no but that I just saw something very strange.  I asked her if I could come down to the radio station and if she could come outside to meet me so if both of us saw it together she could repo! rt it as a witness.  So I took off on my motorcycle and the lady came out with eyes as big as saucers herself.  We then stood together looking up at the sky and at that point I felt rather silly and we saw nothing.  So after saying thank you very much, I took my motorcycle and went back to the house.

At this time it had gotten dark and I parked my bike along-side the house on the lawn.  I got off the bike and looked up at the beautiful starry night Hawaiian sky and said these exact words, ""Well whatever it was I guess I'm not seeing it again.""   Then right at that point came the second strange part of this event, as soon as I said those words ""Well whatever it was I guess I'm not seeing it again"", I noticed to my right at about 3 o'clock something moving very slowly coming right at my direction.  But this time it was something totally different from that of my first sighting, there was no light and it was coming towards me very slowly.  It was again an estimated 5 to 6 hundred feet up, about the same altitude as the first object I saw, and I could tell it was going to come right over my head.  Again, this time there was no light and I watched it get slowly closer and closer.  Then, it got right over my head as I was looking straight up at it and got a ve! ry good look.  When I focused in on it I got the strangest feeling inside of me that this thing wasn't ?bad? but that it wasn't ?good? either.  It never stopped moving but it was moving very slowly and when it got right over my head I could see the bottom of it from the Lihue city lights reflecting off of it.  It looked like a bottom of a frying pan with its re-entry burns on its bottom, a disk approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter at about 500 feet up.  If you held a quarter over your head at arm?s length, that's about how big it looked to me from my vantage point.  And then this part was really weird, when it got right over my head I could see around it's perimeter an orange energy field, like an aura around its perimeter.  Then again, with no lights it slowly went right over Lihue into the mist and that was it.  I was agape and I couldn't believe what I just saw.  I was tempted to chase after it with my bike but I decided not to because I was kind of freaked out.

The next day I went to the Garden Island newspaper and after checking and asking all sorts of people I found no one who saw either the first lighted device or the later disk. Till this day I have found no one who saw it and I still wonder what it actually was, either an alien or military devices.  Kauai does have a known top secrete missile base but I myself believe it was a space craft.  My theory is the first light ball was a remotely controlled device that either was mapping the island or recording some other type of information, and the disk I saw afterwards was the mother craft.  But I guess I'll never know because I haven't seen either since.

So that's my personal UFO story and Mr. Davenport you're the first official UFO expert I have told this too.  It was a remarkable experience and it changed my thinking from UFOs being make believe stuff to something as real as we are.  Has it changed my life all that much?  Not really but I sure get strange reactions when I tell the story to folks.  If you would ever like for me to elaborate with the details a little more, and if anyone else you'd like me to share this with I'd be more than happy too.

First of all sorry for my english. My wife and I were in our car, 40 km from Paris, going to Normandy (on highway). I was driving quite slowly when my wife saw and pointed a static cylinder near clouds on the left side of the highway.  It was very bright (sliver), apparently reflecting the sun like an airplane could do but with no wings, no sound, just like a metallic cylinder shape...  The sky was perfectly clear with just some clouds in one spot (the cylinder was very near from that spot).

We were watching ""that,"" and suddenly a very very very bright light like under a spotlight much more brighter than the sun appeared during perhaps 5 or 10 seconds.

After that, he disapeared like a gun bullet.. a condensation trail appeared slowly and after 2 minuts a beautifull clouds appeared where was the cylinder and got stuck with the others clouds just near. It was a very beautiful scene. Very peaceful.

This event began with a flashing green strobe about 10 degrees over the horizon between the cloud croft mountains and white sands missile range in the Northeast part of the sky. .  

The light was pulsating at different intervals and luminosity for about 15 minutes before a solid green light appeared about 40 degrees above pulsating light.  That light remained constant for about 5 minutes when a solid light descended from sky to near the same area as the solid green light.  

The white light began moving in different directions very erratically and at times making oblong circles.   I would say that it would travel within 15 degrees above, and below the solid green almost instantly.  Closest way to describe its behavior would be like someone trying to film an object in the sky with a shaky hand or a meteorite moving and stopping and changing directions hundreds of times.  Moved faster than I have ever seen something move.  

The entire event ended when the erratic! light stopped and then shot down towards the horizon and green lights appeared to begin moving north easterly.

The entire group of people within our dunes area were watching this.  I would suspect that anyone in the park who was looking in the sky would have seen this.  White Sands National Park stays open late on full moon nights which is why everyone was there.   

I did have a high definition video camera but could not zoom in or out enough to cancel the glare of the moon directly to the left of the event.

About 11:45 on August 12th,2012 I arrived at Lake Thunderbird in Norman,OK. to watch the meteor shower.  My 2 nieces ages 20 and 18 and my 2 year old grandson were with me.  We went to Zoom Beach on Indian Point Road. We sat on a blanket at the most North point of the area.  My grandson was asleep the entire time.  All activity observed was within one half of the sky or a 180 degree area. With 0 degrees being North-80 degrees East and 180 degrees South. We were facing East but slightly North-about 70 degrees.  There was a very tall street light about 200 feet behind us-otherwise it was very dark.  Aprox. 12:15 my niece witnessed a firey orange triangle appear above the treeline across the lake at about 60 degrees.  From the map of the lake I guessed this to be about 2400 feet. We thought this might be the corner of the moon beginning to rise. As we watched it-it flickered/flamelike. It kept the triangular shape but did not have exact edges. It looked like a fire...! yellows/oranges and reddish/brownish at the boundaries.  But the upper right corner seemed to drift in and out of the triangle.   We watched the triangle and saw about 20 meteors until about 1:45. Between 1:45 and 2:00 we witnessed the triangle rise above the trees...it was a cresent moon. We saw the moon rise and all the events to follow 3 different times.  Each episode lasting 45 minutes-1 hour with aprox. 15 minutes of inactivity between each episode.  As we watched the moon, the lower 1/4 began to break away in small pieces,travel a very short distance then return to shape the moon. They appeared like blobs-no definite shape.  But they got larger and smaller as to ""morph"" in size. They were the same firey orange color.  The smaller pieces broke away and returned 3 to 4 times-with the pieces growing larger each time.  Then as an explosion-many many very bright white spheres were emitted from the moon.  At least 50-100 spheres traveling in all directions,within the 60-90! degree area.  The movement was unlike anything man-made or any! kind of machinery I had ever seen.  It appeared lifelike-it reminded me of a swarm of bees. It also reminded me of ""Tinkerbell"" while flying.  The movements were so irradic...sideways/circular/north/south/east/west/up/down/hovering. At times they were faster than anything I have seen.  At other times they moved so slow we questioned each other to verify movement.  During this activity the degree of brightness would change from very bright to very dim,  Then they would disappear and reappear.  They appeared ""playful"". Next at about 70 degrees we noticed a circular area forming...like a black hole. The sky was clear,but clouds just appeared from nowhere.  We kept saying ""cloudlike""-they seemed to move with purpose.  As if to be alive or drawn or pulled to this area.  The clouds formed a cover/curtain in front of the black hole. It became very bright behind the cloud cover. The spheres began darting in and out from behind the cloud cover. Then the clouds just vani! shed.  Next the spheres had more purposeful movement.  They formed a pattern as if to get in line and traveled up to a small cluster of twinkling stars. This was about 85-90 degrees. Hold your arm straight out,bend wrist downward and fan open fingers. This is what the cluster looked like. It had a long tail of stars at the most North point. Next the spheres traveled down the ""fingerlike"" part of the cluster. They were in a line formation and looked like a rescue team from a helicopter-traveling down a hanging rope. At the bottom they scattered very fast and very irradic in all directions and in all 180 degrees. As some traveled closer the sphere shape appeared to be triangular. They had a circle/round light on each point of the triangle. They were all a very bright white light. Next they all traveled North /0 degrees to a bright/stationary/blinking light at the treeline. This was directly over Tinker Air Force Base. Next they were launched a few at a time South/abou! t 145 degrees,to a bright/stationary/blinking light at the tre! eline. B oth the N and S stationary/blinking lights were present during all the previous activity. Reminded me of a lighthouse. Next they were launched very fast South/Southwest to 180 degrees. They were launched in various sized groups-parallel to the treeline. Then they would disappear. It reminded me of bullets being fired from a gun. During the last 10-15 minutes we saw activity leaving the cluster/swarming/traveling North/launched South/launched SW to disappear. All simultaneously-we didn't know where to look. We felt as if we were being diverted from seeing something. We witnessed the same exact /entire episode 2 more times. The only difference being in the last episode which was aprox. 4:00-5:00. After the spheres traveled to the North light we noticed a very bright light traveling on or right above the lake towards us. It was a stationary white light that was directly North and present the entire night-atleast 3,000 feet away. It traveled very fast and irradic. Sideways/circu! lar/hovering and completely silent. The brightness faded in and out/was a single light/was 2 lights-like headlights/ we saw red and green lights. As it came closer it was the triangular shape. When it was about 3-5 feet from our shore the triangle craft disappeared and we immediately heard a small boat motor and saw a small fishing boat land on the shore. We were convinced this was an intentional attempt to make us doubt the entire evening of events. 2 men exited the boat and were camping just west of us. We were to scared to question them about anything. After a few minutes we noticed a triangle craft traveling directly towards us. It was moving so slow it took quite awhile to realize it was getting larger and closer. It was a very bright white light with circles on each point of the triangle. We started to hear noise for the first time all evening. It was fish jumping...alot of fish from all different directions. At its closest we saw faint/almost invisible ""like&quo! t; triangular wings on both sides. The entire evening I had su! ch a war m/good/devine intervention type feeling. When the craft was aprox. 500-700 feet away we heard water bubbling sounds for awhile. I felt my body move backwards as it approached and I was spooked. It started to sprinkle and within 30 seconds a downpour. I picked up my grandson and we all ran to our vehicle. We watched the craft another minute or two. Then it disappeared and the downpour stopped. We watched for another hour atleast before we headed home. That is my sighting...it is what it is. The first hour I tried to rationalize everything to my niece, until I finally realized there was no other earthly expalnation. We were witnessing actual UFO activity. To end...there were absolutely no drugs or alcohol involved. My 20 year old niece witnessed it all with me. I am thankful to have a witness. My 18 year old niece watched some of the meteors than feel asleep. She did wake up at some point and watch also...maybe an hour or so. She was scared and wanted to leave.

Milford, CT,  Gulf Beach, Sunday,  09/02, 9:05PM   After the sighting reported to NUFORC for 08/18 at this location,(and pursuant to the 06/06/12 reports for Milford that share this locale and appearance of object) periodic visits resulted in no activity until this night.   At Gulf Beach 7:45PM, wind from west, then diminished ; broken cloud cover.

First very bright orange-red spark-like light with orange nimbus emerged above treeline at 5 degrees N.  From elevation of 8 degrees it slowly and steadily rose straight up within cloudless area of sky.  This light initially gave the appearance of a slow-motion firework missile that was launched and primed to explode.  It was extremely bright and obviously propelled, not simply drifting.  Through 10x21 binoculars this light appeared fan-shaped (picture a deep U shape, wide at the top, with a small ball- shaped nucleus of brighter and deeper orange light resting at the bottom).  Overall impression was of a concise ball of light surrounded by a nimbus of hazier orange light.  I do not recall any fluctuation of the luminosity.   Slow ascent of this light continued for approximately 90 seconds.   Strobed a 110 lumen LED flashlight at this object during its ascent, with no response.  During last few seconds of ascent this light faded away until it was no longer visible in cloudles! s area of sky at 35 degree elevation.  Estimated distance from beach = 3,000 feet, which possibly positions it above marshland near a cemetary.

Within 5 minutes of the first light?s fading away, another identical light rose above treeline at 355 degrees N.  Same appearance and gradual ascent straight up.  Likewise, viewed through binoculars and signalled with flashlight: same situation as previous until it similarly faded away at 35 degree elevation.

 After waiting about 30 minutes for the chance of a repetition, packed up and ready to leave when, through the broken cloud cover to the ESE glimpsed a more distant but similarly colored light slowly ascending into the clouds.  Assuming that this might have been an error on my part, or a prosaic aircraft, I prepared to investigate a playing field about a mile to the north, from which chinese lantern/balloons could have been released.

 Within several minutes another bright orange light rose up behind the treeline in the exact same location that the previous light had been briefly noticed.  At 13 degrees elevation and 145 degrees SE  this light, identical to the pair that had just previously emerged from the north, slowly rose at what appeared to be the same distance from the beach (3,000 feet), which would place it out over Long Island Sound.  After about 105 seconds it too faded away in identical fashion.   No equipment used in this observation.  9:45PM was the end of this group of sightings.","Banking Print Center Site Associate",1,4,"oval",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"One of six sightings from same source, submitted over the course of two months.

Normally I wouldn?t have even noticed it, because it made no noise at all. I had my glasses on, so I was able to see it well.

I watched as it soundlessly glided in a southern direction through the sky, and I tried to identify whether it was a larger jet that perhaps had taken off from the airport, or a smaller aircraft.  It had no contrail, so I looked for its wings and to my surprise it had none.  It either greatly sparkled in the sun, or was emitting fluctuating bright light. I saw no windows on the object.  Then, I got concerned thinking it might be either a large missile directed at some point in the USA or a UFO.

As it headed out of sight, I began to experience a strong feeling of dizziness, unbalance, and a general feeling of malaise which passed in several minutes after coming indoors.","Retired teacher",1,1,"cigar",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2012,2010,4,10,9,"Morning","South",0,1,0,1,0

11:00pm (approx) sky conditions: night, mostly clear, little ambient brightness, dim moon  PRE-SIGHTING  I was walking towards a house, about to knock on the door to enter when a helicopter began to amble by, a few hundred feet off the ground parallel to me, maybe half a mile away. the fact that it sounded heavy and had distinct lighting gave me the impression that it was a military helicopter, so i studied it as i knocked on the door. it was flying West to East.

SIGHTING  it was at this point an object emerged from the eastern horizon, flying east to west at over supersonic speeds. it flew maybe 800+ feet above (although not directly 'above', likely on its flank a bit as it was hard to tell from my angle) the chopper. it made no sound at all and gave no heat or other effects and crossed the entire sky in about 2 and a half seconds.

It had one indescribably bright light on the center of the object, that flashed at regular intervals. the 'light' had only a few chances to flash due to the objects' speed. the light was so bright, so intensely white that you could see every color of the rainbow streaming within the light. there were perhaps other, dimmer white lights that stayed on constantly, placed around the craft.

The main body of the craft was very hard to distinguish in the darkness, but the lights on its own body gave some ambient illumination to itself. i could barely make out the greyed outline of a bizarre, somewhat triangle shaped craft. when the light would flash, it would be blocked out by the intensity. when it was off briefly, there was still light emerging from the craft, although not as bright. the lights on the object far outshone that of the helicopters', even the moon. the light was distinctly inhuman.

Because of the sudden nature of the event, i did not really try to make sure i would remember the details of the craft itself, as i was still what i would describe as 'calmly-lobotomized', staring like an idiot into the sky away from their house as someone opened the door.

I believe there is a possibility that the chopper pilots may have also seen the craft, although given its speed and silent nature there is a chance they only saw a white flash in the corner of the eyes. Choppers seemed to remain in the sky for the rest of the night as i saw one driving a few hours later and also heard another when i got home.

I give an estimate of 900+ feet for the elevation of the craft, and perhaps about the size of a good boat, quit a bit larger than a fighter jet.

I have seen F-16s, F-15s, F-22s, F-18s, MiGs, at night, at day, flying high, low, supersonic, really slow, you name it. I have looked down the barrel an A-10 Warthogs' Gatling gun.  I  have seen b-2 spirits, Stealth fighters, both parked and flying in close detail(although men guarded the F117 nighthawk) i have been in a V-22 Osprey helicopter, hueys, Apaches, UH-60 Blackhawk, freaking chinooks.  I have been on countless commercial aircraft of all make and size my whole life.

This was NOT a known aircraft, to be certain. it demonstrated distinctly inhuman traits. if it was human, i conjecture top secret military craft.

Unusual Sighting:  I?m reporting an unusual and unexplainable event that I witnessed the evening of December 12th, 2012. I went outside with my 2 dogs at approximately 8:15 to 8:20PM. I always enjoy looking at the early morning and nighttime sky.  I live about 45 miles southeast of Columbus Ohio in the middle of nowhere, so there is very little light pollution from the city lights to ruin my beautiful view of the stars. It had rained for several days prior to this day so the cloud cover up until now had been constant.

I walked down the few steps from my deck on to the sidewalk. The dogs were out in the yard somewhere in the darkness doing what dogs do.  I looked up and there was the beautiful star lit sky that I had missed for several days.  I was looking up and westward, probably around 70 degrees off of the horizon, not straight up but still at a rather steep angle.  As I was admiring what I had so terribly missed, I noticed that one of the ?stars? was moving. It was moving very quickly from a westerly direction towards the east.  My first thought was that it must be the ISS (International Space Station). I know it can be viewed at certain times and saw it myself a few years ago when one of the local TV weathermen mentioned on his telecast when and where to look for it.  The moving ?star? was just that????.about the same brightness as an average star in the nighttime sky and seemingly about the same size and distance away.  It was moving very, very quickly and then I realized it couldn?t be ! the ISS because it wasn?t moving in an exact straight path but rather had a slight waver to it as it traveled. It also didn?t maintain the same constant speed but would slow down slightly and the speed back up again. I blinked my eyes a couple of times and thought to myself, ""Am I really seeing what I think I?m seeing?""  

I thought for a moment of running into the house to get my wife and have her see what I was seeing.  But I was afraid that it may be gone by the time I was able to persuade her to see for herself.  I continued to watch this peculiar ?star? when it suddenly made a very quick ?U? turn, turning to the south and then immediately back towards the west again.  This ?U? turn took all of 2 seconds tops. I knew then it couldn?t be any kind of conventional aircraft.  A jetliner has to make a prolonged swooping turn that would take many, many seconds.  An asteroid or meteorite would not make any turn at all to the best of my knowledge.  It was much too high to be a helicopter. I continued to watch this object as it was heading west again at a fast pace.  

Suddenly, it made a 90 degree fight turn towards the north and traveled at the speed of a bullet until it was out of sight. This entire event that I witnessed was over a period of 15 to 20 seconds at the most. I continued to watch to see if ! it returned and went back outside several more times as the evening wore on but never saw it again.

There was no audible sound from the object. It had no blinking lights but rather just the same constant glow and color as the stars. I went into the house and told my wife what I had just witnessed. She looked at me as if I had three heads. I told her that I should report this to ?somebody?????.the Sheriff, the Highway Patrol???the Columbus International Airport??but who? She Googled something on her i-Phone and came up with the National UFO Reporting Center. I called the listed phone number and left a message. I received a call back a short time later and spoke with Mr. Peter Davenport, the director. He said he was very interested in my sighting and asked me to document what I saw on their web-sight.

I am a 59 year old male.  I?m a Design Supervisor for an engineering company in Columbus Ohio.  We provide the design and engineering of protection and control systems for the local electric utility.  I?ve been doing this work for over 40 years.

12/23/12 @ 8:40pm   Very clear night.  We had observed the moon in perfect clarity at about 6pm. Cold...35-40 degrees.  Wife and the kids and I were sitting in our bed watching TV.  There was a flash of red light outside so bright it lit up far bedroom wall.  Kids didnt notice and continued to watch TV. Wife and I immediately looked out the window towards the city (about 200 feet off the 1500 Harbor Boulevard Pier) and saw something moving extremely fast from the sky down to the water (whole event was maybe 2 seconds after the flash).  It had a bright red light on it (not like fire....like a beacon).  Size is difficult to determine.  It seemed large considering it was about 600 feet away from our window.  Maybe the size of a helicopter but made up of a much simpler design like two large iron girders (as seen when building a sky scraper) attached at a 45 degree angle with red light on one end of one of the girders.  Angle of descent was pretty much straight down (90 degrees). Seemed way to fast to just b! e something falling from a plane.  Seemed propelled.  

I braced for an explosion.  I thought maybe a helicopter was crashing but there was zero sound.  Even if the object hit water, it would have HAD to make a loud boom with it's size and at the speed it was moving. At first wife thought it was a projectile (missile?). We ruled out fireworks because of the downward nature and lack of sound. I initially thought it might have been a piece of a plane....but no sound???....and its speed made it look propelled. Immediately afterward, we ran to window and scanned sky and NYC skyline.  I saw a plane high above moving Northwesterly almost right above us.  

About 2 minutes afterward, I saw a ferry boat on the NY side of the river heading south towards us.  Went downstairs for different perspective.  Might have seen people on a boat at the marina. The boat slip was all the way at the end of the pier on the river. I saw lights on the boat but couldn't tell if there were people outside of it. It! was very cold so it seemed unlikely.  If there were people, th! ey would have HAD to seen it.  It would have only been a few hundred feet from them. We were very frightened by the event.  My hands actually were shaking a little.  I considered reporting it to the non-emergency police number as a possible aircraft crash, but decided not to due to the lack of crash sounds and subsequent lack of visual confirmation of a crash.  On morning of 12/24/12 (8am), we went in separate rooms and drew what we had seen.  Daughter didn't witness the object but drew based on our descriptions the night before.  When we compared, we were frightened at how they are almost identical depictions.

12/24/12 @ 1:00am  Same night.  Kids sleeping in our bed. Woken by wife bringing son to kids bathroom. I went into master bath to go to the bathroom.  No lights on in room or bathroom. Bathroom dark and has no windows.  Went to bathroom and upon exiting, noticed a green glow coming from jacuzzi bathtub.  I took a closer look and confirmed something underneath the plastic of the jacuzzi was glowing green (very similar to texture?/color of a green aurora borealis). It looked soft.  I could see it through the plastic and the glow was unmistakable.  The strangest thing is that it didn't seem to alarm or scare me.  I was very calm even though now it seems insane.  I looked at it for about 5 seconds and then walked calmly to wife in the other bedroom to tell her to come see it.  We slowly walked back to the bathroom (total elapsed time about 10-15 seconds) and looked in bathtub. Now I was shocked. The light was gone and the contrast of it now being dark and not glowing seemed to frighten me. It was like I wo! ke up to the realization that the light that was there before was completely unnatural. I knew that, unless there were indeed green lights under the plastic tub, that were somehow turned on for that short period of time, this should not have happened. I have no explanation for this event. I don't even have a hunch as to possibilities of what it was.","IT",2,1,"other",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2012,2010,4,12,20,"Evening","Northeast",0,1,0,0,0

I was walking the dog and watching the fireworks towards the beach.  Then I saw the red fireball light moving upward. I thought it was another firework so I waited for it to go off.  It didn't, it just kept going up. 

Then I thought to myself well maybe it's a missile or rocket from the space center but no it couldn't be. It is way to far north and it was out in the water. 

So I ran in the house to get my wife so she could see it.  Came back out and it was still there but had leveled off.  It just kept moving away from the shore until it just disappeared.

Conditions:  Around midnight, pretty sure the skies were clear, with no Delta Breeze at all.

Location:  Between South Sacramento and Elk Grove  A friend and I were southbound on Elk Grove Florin Road approaching the stop sign at Calvine Road slowing on approach to the stop sign.  Nothing out there except a house on south/west corner, two story right on the corner.  Green light from source about 20 feet above second story beaming a trapezoid shape of same light down on back of house and back yard.  We could see the trees behind the house, the light waving off of the peak of the house like a mirage, or heat off the hood of a car.  I was staring into ""source"" that was around 30ft x 12ft. I was looking into the rectangle to see equipment, or anything but it was just pure lime green light, saw nothing.

Also, we did not see a shape, lights, a craft, nothing.  Not even sound.  Then I got out of my car and by the time I looked back up it was gone, however the little street light that lit up the little 4 way stop was illuminating a/an ""exhaust cloud"", ""churned up atmosphere"", or what I call the ""Doughnut shaped cloud that the Road Runner leaves when he splits.""  This ""cloud"" was floating at a 45 degree angle and if the ""Road Runner"" just ""split"" the trajectory of the object was South/Southwest (If Calvine is true East/West).  We watched this ""cloud"" or ""vapor"" float for about 20 seconds before 2 fighter jets buzzed us from Mather Air Base.  Some seconds later or minutes, came the rumble of a C-130 or AWAX, something obviously bigger and slower than the fighter jets inbound on the same course as the fighter jets, eventually coming overhead and continuing Southeast.

No other cars were at the intersection, not much traffic at all on the roads in that area at that time back then.  We got in my car and left, turned on the radio and heard DJ's saying people calling in from all over the Sacramento area with sightings.

Next day evening news said, ""We looked into the sightings from last night and spoke to (Naval Command?) and confirmed that it was a test missile launch from the San Fransisco area.""  My friend's dad flew the (T-42?) trainer jet out of Mather, a side by side 2 seater jet for training new pilots.  He said to his dad that we had still not stopped talking about what we saw and after asking his dad what it was his reply was, ""I cannot tell you what it was, but what I can tell you is that it wasn't a missile launch from San Fransisco.""  Since then, I've studied Ufology, and seen almost every video, and read a pile of sighting stories and I still haven't read or seen anything I saw that night.  After years and years of study, and cutting away the media fat, smoke and mirrors and separating information from mis-information and dis-information I'm about 98% convinced that what we saw was either a multi-dimensional craft, or this realm/dimension simply opening up to the other side.  The latter is from a total lack of observing any craft, or lights, or sound at all.

I was 11 years old in 1947 and lived in south central Los Angeles at the time of the ""flying saucer"" siting.  It was night time and my friend and I saw a red glowing disk traveling at enormous speeds, southeast to northwest over Los Angeles. The flying saucer was very high in a super clear night sky.

I'm a college graduate and worked for Lockheed Martin Corp. for 39 years and retired 3 years ago.  I'm 69.  I'm an amateur astronomer and I am familiar with the night sky, stars and planets.  I would call myself a ""trained observer"" having lived near airports and now near Cape Canaveral, Florida where missiles commonly take off.  I was also in the Air Force with the Hayward National Guard in California.  My point is that I know what I am looking at and can judge speed and altitude as well as identify night time objects in the sky.

I have always described the flying saucer I saw as a looking like a round red Ford tail light of the 1950s traveling at an altitude above 30,000 feet and probably much higher (70,000 feet or more).  So, I estimate the flying saucer was at least twice the size of a modern airliner at 30,000 feet, bigger if it was higher.  The glowing red ""saucer"" appeared to be a perfect disk, not a ball.  The glowing red disk had no other features.  As I say, the speed of the round red disk was enormous flying horizon to horizon in less than 20 seconds at an extremly high altitude plastered against the roof one of the best night skys I have ever seen which is why my friend and I were looking up at the time.  We caught site of the glowing red disk about 30 degrees above the horizon to the southeast and watched it disappear to the northwest.

My date of the siting is approximate as to month and time, but I'm pretty sure it was 1954 judging by the events going on in my life at the time.  It was a warm summer evening, and I was taking my friend home on the handle bars of my bicycle at the time as we were marveling at the clarity of the night sky and the stars.

The reason that I believe it was a ""flying saucer"" is because no aircraft of the times in 1954 or now could even begin to match the speeds of this object.  This red glowing disk left no trail like a fireball meteor which I have also seen.  It just zipped across the L.A. night sky in a straight line horizon to horizon in a matter of seconds never losing its circular (disk-like) shape or losing speed or altitude.  It left no trail or emited sound.  If I was going to guess at the speed and altitude of the flying saucer I saw, I would say it was flying at 70,000 feet or more at speeds of tens of thousands of miles per hour.  This was not a common site in 1954 or even now with our rockets and satellites which I am also very familiar with having worked for Lockheed Corp and living now near Cape Canaveral, Florida.  Nothing in our arsenal of jets and rockets flys anywhere near as fast the flying saucer I saw that summer night in 1954.

Then, the orange light shut off for about 2 seconds and turned on and moved away from us very fast.

Unidentified Object Over Stuart/Hobe Sound, Florida  While driving north on US Hwy 1 in Hobe Sound, Florida (just south of Stuart)on January 30th, 2013 - at approximately 8:49pm - a fast-moving, bright orange object caught my eye, to the east, over Jupiter Island. At first, I thought it was a plane, but noticed it looked too large to be airplane lights, and that it had a fiery / flaming orange trail. It was flying south, parallel to the coastline. My next thought was that it was possibly something that had been launched from Cape Canaveral, as we can occasionally see night-launches from our area. I had just driven from Jupiter/Tequesta, and had noticed a bright light (also in the east) possibly from a helicopter or airplane, about 8 miles south of where I saw the above-mentioned object. The reason I mention this, is because what initially caught my eye was the great speed of the orange flaming trail in relation to the light seen over the Jupiter/Tequesta area, less than 10 minutes prior. The sky was clear, with no clouds.

I pulled over in a church parking lot (east side of US Hwy 1) to get a better look, and immediately dialed my husband from my cell phone. (8:50pm) I told him to look to the southeast. I asked if he could see it from our home in Stuart, just a few miles north and slightly west of where I had pulled over. He could not. He is a pilot, and thought I might have been seeing a jet-engine flaring. I did not think so, due to the fact it was moving so fast, and also, so straight. (Horizontally) After about 20-30 seconds, the trail was no longer visible, but I could still see a light (just a circular light)traveling straight and to the south, but much faster than it had been moving while the trail was visible. At this point I assumed it might be a meteorite or satellite, but thought it unlikely due to it's speed and how it did not lose altitude.

The entire viewing lasted less than a minute. I watched the evening news at 11pm, thinking I would see a report of something unusual. Since I did not, I decided to research news online.

I wasn't sure what this event fell under spiritual or ufo, so I will give it my best shot. 

My son and I were travelling North Bound on 63 highway when I first saw the object I was in North Central Arkansas near mammoth springs.  I was driving in the dark around curves and as I leaned forward to sneeze I looked up and through the wind shield I saw sparkling fire projectile out of a craft almost like it was making fun of my sneezing motion or like ""vomiting"" sparks in the sky.  I thought it may be fireworks of some kind, but didn't see a trail.  

We continued down the road a few miles when I saw it off this time to the right up in the sky but this time there were two objects in the sky. they were like pinwheels in the sky. flying off sparks and spinning. this time was 18:45 and I pulled over to try to get pictures I wasn't parked very well and was concerned so I didn't stay very long. 

I struggled with my cell phone, but as soon as I got it out to record the craft disappeared.  It was a golden color.  Disappointed I got back in my vehicle with my son, and we continued on our way. I noted the name of a creek on the highway called field creek.  We didn't see the craft again until we reached Thayer Missouri, where I noticed the off to the right side of town again.  Myself and My son pulled over to the side of the road and watched as the fireballs/crafts danced around each other like a yin/yang then once again when I got my phone out to record they disappeared.  My son noticed that their were very small dots in the sky which blinked on and off, remained perfectly aligned vertically and moved quickly from one side of the sky to the other blinking on and off much like pac-man dots.  They avoided going directly over the town but instead made sure to go over rural areas.  That last time we saw them was at 19:11.  I finally got around to doing this report as it was very bu! sy during the holidays and things have calmed down.","none",2,1,"unknown",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2012,2010,4,11,19,"Evening","Midwest",0,1,1,0,0

My husband, 2 boys (12 and 14) and I were watching T.V. just before 8 pm. on Sunday evening.  My husband looked out of our large bay window (from the second story of our house) and noticed 2 solid orange/red round lights coming over the trees from across the street (from the East).  They were spaced apart and flying evenly spaced.  We all looked out the window and noticed another set of 2 lights coming behind the other 2, spaced evenly apart as well. Then we noticed another set of 2 lights, also spaced evenly from each other.  There were 3 sets of these lights, 6 altogether, flying slowly and evenly in formation in a Northwest direction.  We ran outside to get a better look and to determine if they were planes or helicopters, but there was no sound coming from the lights.

Intrigued, I called our next door neighbors (who are our relatives) to look out of their front door to see the lights.  By the time they got there they saw the last set of 2 lights.  They didn?t hear any sound either and couldn?t figure out what it could be.  We have a military airstrip not far away and frequently see military planes practice over our houses on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but we all determined these were definitely not planes.

The lights were orange/red in color and were round in shape.  I thought I saw a small blinking light in them, but it was very tiny in comparison to the solid orange color.  They moved slowly and evenly and seemed to eventually disappear as they were flying north.  My son described the lights as flames coming off the back of missiles, but I thought they were more consistent in shape than a flame would be.

We came back inside and a few minutes later a single orange/red light started coming from the direction the others had come from. It was not spaced out evenly behind the others; it was farther behind the rest.  But it moved slowly following the same path the others did.  It eventually disappeared in the sky as well.  We tried to get a video but couldn?t pick it up in the night sky.

I decided to check online the next day to see if there were any reports on the news and if anyone had seen these strange lights in the area.  I was shocked to find your website and to see that others had seen these at different times and places and am convinced they are the same things that others have seen.

On Saturday evening, Feb 16, 2013, I was driving to the grocery store between 9:00 and 9:30 PM.  I was not wearing my watch.

It was a cold night, and rather dark (except for street lights and the moon).

A number of airplanes (airliners, I presume) were in the sky, landing or taking off from the MSP airport, located towards the east.

There is no military airport in the area, but Navy Reserve and Air National Guard planes used to be based there (and possibly still are - I don't know).  Many decades ago, the Navy based Panther jets and some other planes there, and the ANG based F-89 Scorpions, C-119 Flying Boxcars, T-33s, and some other planes at their side of the airport.

[Note: Some models of the F-89 were capable of carrying the Genie air-to-air nuclear-tipped guided missile.  I don't know if our local F-89s were equipped with any Genie's. The Genie went into service in July, 1957. The F-89 is now long obsolete, and the Genie probably is, as well.]  The point is that our ""civilian"" airport has not been purely civilian, over the years, and there's a chance that some of the ANG Scorpions carried nuclear weapons. Not too likely, but possible.

As I proceeded down Noble Avenue, a few blocks from home, I noticed something in the sky in a southeast direction, viewed between obscuring trees. There appeared to be a clump of stars and lights. I noted that if some of them were stars, they were unusually clear and bright - like one would see in the country - not the city.

I vaguely recall that the pattern of stars looked like the Big Dipper, but it could NOT have been the Big Dipper in such a southeast location.

I mention it only because it attracted my attention - not because I think the Big Dipper moved.

Then I noticed that some ""extra stars"", so to speak, were orange.

I have never seen orange stars before, and doubt that any exist.

Curious, I pulled over as soon as I could (there was no traffic), and viewed the scene between the trees while stopped.

I saw 3 orange lights in an arrowhead shape slowly moving westward - possibly slightly north (west-northwest).  For a movement reference point, I used a utility line (probably a cable TV line or phone line), and watched them as they slowly passed over the utility line, with the point of the arrow head leading the way.

There were no red-white-green navigation lights or anti-collision lights visible (strobe lights), nor any flashing red lights on, or near, any of the objects.

I did not hear any noise, as far as I know, but any noise would probably have been drowned out by the several airliners visible in the 25-mile vicinity.  (It looked like a busy night for air traffic).

Airline passengers could probably have seen the lights if the plane was northbound or southbound, by looking up and towards the the east (when I saw them).

After perhaps 15 seconds, they disappeared either behind some light clouds or a tree (I don't remember), so I headed to the nearby school parking lot to get a better view, in case they were still visible.  Unfortunately, they had vanished, probably behind a large area of broken clouds.  I remained there in my car for a few minutes, but never saw them again.

Once I arrived at the grocery store parking lot, about 5 minutes later, I did scan the sky for a while after exiting the car, but just saw the usual broken clouds and the moon.  It was very cold, and I didn't stand there for long.

I don't know if the lights were connected to a large object. All I saw were the orange lights, and didn't notice any stars being blacked-out.  In terms of observing, the conditions were terrible, but at least I saw the silent, beautiful lights for a little while.

[NOTE: Peter, the directions on your web page are almost impossible to read. In fact, I could **NOT** read them.  They are tiny red letters on a gray background.  I had to do a copy-and-paste of the requested date format to a TXT document, and enlarge the letters to read:  ""Use MM/DD/YY format..""

I guessed at the formats for the other boxes because I couldn't read those tiny red letters, either.

If your webmaster designed the page, he did a TERRIBLE JOB!!!!  Making instructions legible is BASIC and ELEMENTARY, and is not ROCKET SCIENCE.  You should have him fix it with much larger font and some other color.  In fact, you could lighten or eliminate the gray background.  It doesn't need to be there.  But the gray background could stay if the tiny red letters are junked - as they should be.  The black letters stand out well (oddly enough) and are large enough.  What was he smoking when he designed it???  I'm running Internet Explorer V8 (IE8) under Windows/XP SP3.  The view size is 100%.  When I enlarged it to 150% size by using the ZOOM tool, I could STILL hardly read the red letters!!  Maybe you would get more reports if people could read the directions...]

I was returning from a business trip with two colleagues on Alaska Airlines from DC to LA.  Over the Grand Canyon, I saw a black craft shaped like a bullet going at an amazing speed in the opposite direction very close to our airplane leaving a trail of thick black smoke behind it.  

A few minutes later, an identical craft with the same black trail went by.  I would concede it may have been a military plane, but thing that bothers me is that the smoke trail dissipated at the exact same speed as the craft, as if it were a part of it.  If a military plane were emitting black smoke from burning oil, it would have left a trail across the sky.  

What my friends couldn't see because I was in the window seat is just before the second craft left my view, I saw it tilt upward and the black smoke trail disappeared in a split second.

The crazier part of the story is that when I returned home, I was telling my son the story while looking out the window of our home in Beverly Hills, CA.  I saw two brilliant white planes flying towards us.  I didn't think anything of it until the one on the right just disappeared, then the one on the left made a perfectly tight loop in the air, then disappeared.  It was a manoeuvre that would be impossible with a plane, and it was close enough that I could tell it was not a helicopter.  

This was at about 3pm on 2/24/13.  

And that's my UFO story.

3 years ago, in roughly the late spring/early summer of 2010, around 9 PM, I saw something that I can't even begin to understand.  It's even hard to explain, just because we don't have the vocabulary for what I saw, but I will do my best to describe it to you.  Maybe (hopefully), one of your readers saw the same thing and can help me TO describe it. (lol)  

First off, we live near an active Air Force Base and Missile Range, so hearing planes and sonic booms is nothing but background noise to us.  What made this night so unusual, was the number of planes SCREAMING over our house that late at night.  It literally sounded like a war was going on outside.  Complete with, what sounded like, explosions.  I used to be in the Army and supported the infantry guys, so I got used to the  sound of explosions, just not over civilians.  It got me VERY concerned.  I went out onto my back porch which faced the AF Base to see what in the heck was going on.

I look out my back porch door, and saw what looked like a flare shooting up from the base.  I kept thinking, I know those things are bright, but there is NO way I could see a flare that well from this distance (approx 20 miles as the crow flies from their testing area to give you perspective).  I realized then that it was a missile they were shooting!  And from my point of view, directly towards civilian houses.  It hit something REALLY big.  This is the part I will have a hard time explaining, we really don't have words for this next part.

When the missile hit whatever it was, and it looked like a dead on hit, it didn't act like any explosion I have ever seen.  This is the only way I can describe this so I'm sorry, but you know the movie Independence Day, when they shoot all the missiles at the ships in the beginning and it hits a force field?  It looked like that, without all the green special effects.  The explosion wrapped around whatever it was.  I could actually SEE the explosion wrap around whatever it was.  It was no plane I'd ever seen.  It looked like it was roughly the size of an aircraft carrier. with a weird cigar shaped looking front and no wings.   I saw the bits of the missile fall down and then nothing after that.  The next day they had helicopters everywhere in the direction of what I saw, and way more jets out then usual.

So that's my story, it's definitely the weirdest thing I've ever seen, and even now my brain has a hard time comprehending what I saw.  It makes no sense you know?

At 5 am I was setting on the edge of my bed looking out my window to th northwest.  Earlier I was admiring the huge bright moon while it slipped below the tree line.

 As I was taking a pill I looked up and saw 2 lights, shaped oval, hovering over an old Bomarc missile base about a mile or so to the Northwest, just appear out of the darkness.

They just hovered there for about a minute not changing color or shape.

 I awoke my wife to see these lights, and just as she moved to see out the window they started moving to the East.  They made no noise and the clear white light just kind of flickered slightly.  They moved off to the east from the point I first saw them.

 Now I am a pilot with over 1200 hours in my log book and, who's father was a navigation tech. With both the USAF and with the Federal Aviation Admin.  I grew up around Loring AFB and the Presque Isle airport (along with many nav sights in northern Maine).

 My point here is these lights were between me and the Bangor VOR, which sits a few miles off the north end of Bangor International Airport.

There were no strobe or anti collision  lights, no wing position lights, a red light should have been visible as they were approaching me and the left wing would have a red light marking it.   As i said earlier, there was no sound at any time.  The lights were about 2 to 3 football fields apart from the time the appeared until they moved out of my sight.

 I see aircraft flying over and around home most every day.  BIA is the home of the 101st air refueling wing, flying KC 135 Stratotankers, which make a huge noise on take off and cruising overhead.   Also we have a helicopter unit stationed here, flying UH 60 Blackhawks, which are also noisy.

 The lights approached no closer than  2 football fields near me.  I saw no other lights or aircraft in the sky.

I was walking my dog, like i do every night while listening to music.  I live next to a lake which is quite dark and deserted around the late evening.  As i was walking my dog along the water i noticed a large light in the distance but ignored it thinking that it was a helicopter with the spotlight on, possibly looking for a criminal and i also saw what appared to be a plane chasing or observing its actions.  As i continued walking, i noticed clouds moving in fairly quickly around the sky but wasnt bothered by it because it was coming in fast but not too abnormally fast.  There was also one rather large dark cloud that began to cloak the moon so it became eclipsed, but you could still see a glow around the cloud.  i found this strange because when i began my walk, there were only a few clouds but soon began to look like a light fog or mist.  As i got towards the end of the trail next to the lake, my dog decided to urinate on a plant as he normally does. Usually wh! en my dog has to stop, i take my time to enjoy my music and stare at the sky and the stars. As my dog urinated, i looked up at the sky and saw the light again but this time it wasnt as far into the distance as before, but still relatively far away.  I stared at the light and tried to determine what it was, and noticed it had a spherical shape with a glow around it.  The light made a slow and small left to right motion and hovered there and then bolted past the trees and dissapeared, i am not sure if the object emitted noise because i was listening to music but a couple seconds before i noticed the light, my phone lost reception but this only lasted a few seconds then returned to normal still before i had noticed the light. This could not have been a comet because the sky was cloaked with clouds at this point and you could barely see the moons glow past the dark clouds and this light was bright and too large to be a comet. I also thought it could be a missile, because of the ! recent threats made by north korea but a missile could not hav! e made t hat left to right motion and just hover. This could not have been a plane or helicopter because of the speed it was traveling as it left, it was going at the rate of shooting star; possibly even faster. Prior to leaving my house, i heard rain outside my window for about less than 5 minutes, as well as 2 or 3 car alarms going off but am not sure if it ties into the sighting. after seeing this light, i ran home out of fear and panic along with my dog. Im scared, because i don't know what i saw tonight and feel slightly traumatized because it is the strangest thing i've seen in my whole life.","Student/Cashier.",1,1,"orb",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2013,2010,1,3,0,"Night","West",0,1,0,0,0

To me that means, that this thing had to have been HUGE!  It did not seem to be reflecting light, because the light was evenly distributed across the entire surface, and the color was a very light blue it was like the light was being emitted by it.  The actual shape of the craft was, well it looked a lot like a (22) bullet, but without the rings on the back of it, it was not metallic but more like pale porcelain with this very pale light blue all over it.

I have a BS degree in applied physics and worked 27 years as an aerospace engineer (flight and fluid mechanics) for the navy performing research and development testing of missile systems at the Naval Missile Center Pt Mugu, Ca.

Standing in my lemon orchard in Camarillo, Ca, on Aug 2, 2002 10:30 p.m. to watch annual meteor shower.   No city lights, very dark.

Facing eastward looking upward, extremely clear sky black as pitch except background of stars and moon at my back. to the west.

Suddenly a craft with no lights and no sound moved rapidly from south by southwest to north by northeast across my line of sight .

Would not have seen it since it was flat black against a dark background but it was faintly illuminated by the moonlight so there was enough contrast to see outline.

Would not have noticed it except my eye caught the motion and I watched it traverse the night sky until it was no longer observable.

The following are my observations  1) craft was controlled: smooth transition, constant altitude, constant velocity, constant direction  2) time to transit across my field of view: approx 15 seconds. velocity estimated above mach 12  3) approximate altitude: only a guess but I estimate 15,000 ft - 20,000 ft  4) size: very large (huge).  I estimate 200 ft - 300 ft length (minimum)  5) shape: concentric symetrical shape, flat undercarrige, beveled edges fore and aft rising to a flat upper surface (picture two inverted pie pans one smaller on top of the larger)  6) ratio of height to length: rough estimate 1 : 6  (no idea of top profile since I was looking at it broadside)  7) sound: absolutely none - silent  8) lights: none. totally flat black. barely illuminated against dark night background by reflected moonlight.  9) features: none that I could discern, surface appeared smooth  10) propulsion: not chemical, no combustion, no sign of heat or exhaust no sound  11) anamolies: extremely large, apparently frictionless motion, no sonic wave, no sound , no visable lights or leading edge surface heating,

She took pictures of this object moving from our objective left to our right (so from east to west from our perceptive of vision) she could see it and I couldn't so I asked her to take pictures. I still couldn't see the object but the camera could.  Looking at her pictures it looks like a bullet shaped object that's transparent but with color at the flying end.

I am a science teacher and tonight, as I entered the house just after dusk, I noticed a large, bullet shaped object coming towards my part of the overhead atmosphere.  At it's speed I first thought it to be a helicopter, due to size and altitude, but it had no noise and no visible tapering tail end.  It was shaped more like a ahort bullet and glowed reddish/orange/yellow as if it were extremely warm.  It was not a meteor.  It did not travel in a straight path but rather moved slowly on an angle, as if to steer it self a bit and then straighten out again.  I had enought time to call a witness to this from in the house.

As the oject moved over head it appeared to pulse with this heat while it seemed like it was losing some of that heat.  It was moving slowly, like a slow helicopter speed.  As it pulled away finally, after 2 minutes, it started to cool and slowly went black, not to relight.  I looked to watch it then continue on it's way, as black stone looking object as if it never been lighted in the 1st place.

This object had no flaming, fireball tail and did not appear to be disintergrating.  It just looked aglow and seemed to pulsate with reddish/yellow heat.  Moving at a rather astonishly slow clip. Once black, it drifted out of sight to the north.

At 21:15 myself +2 neighbors were talking, location was approx. 3 miles south of Clermont Florida. I was facing toward the north, a treeline is positioned approx. 1/2 mile north of my position and tops of structures, including a hospital with a life-flight helicopter can be seen in the distance; approx. 3 miles, weather conditions were calm and clear with 10+ miles visibility, upon seeing the first object my reaction was to think it was a helicopter perhaps transiting smoke from some distant brush fire, the nose light was very orange, I indeed stated to my neighbor are there any fires in the area, the ""Life-flight"" looks odd. The object was moving east to west at a perceived elevation of less than 1000 ft.  (Based on building elevations)speed appeared to be consistent with that of a helicopter in forward flight, except no noise.  All three of us watched this object, then a second one appeared above the treeline ""Flying"" what I can only describe as erratically, changing elevation and direction; best I can describe would be a corkscrew flightpath.

With both object clearly visible; they now had our collective full attention, the second object I perceived to be in trail of the first by approx. 2 miles, then a third became visible, again trailing by about 2 miles, the guessing now started between three of us, a flight of aircraft on afterburner, nope, no noise, perhaps a group of cruise type missiles, we do have a bombing range 30 miles to our west, objects 1,2 and 3 were clearly visible Florida is very flat, I ran to my house and quickly returned with my marine binoculars and quickly brought number 3 into view, it even through the binoculars appeared as an hazy orange elongated ball, my wife arrived home and also observed the objects, then number 4 appeared and the corkscrew flightpath was duplicated except it was about what appeared to be at least 5 miles behind number 3 the only other one still visible.  Light number 4 then went into a flat flight for about 10 seconds and then speed up and transitioned east to west at ! an extremely high rate of climb and speed, 3 then vanished quickly followed by number 4, it did not fade out, but more like flipped the light switch, gone.

On May 24, 2013, at approximately 9:15 pm, I was on W. Hill Rd in Flint MI. I was facing a more or less Westerly direction and looked up.  Over my right shoulder, travelling from East to West was a flying object trailing a long tail of fire.

As I watched, I removed my cell phone and recorded video footage of the event.

The object proceeded in a Westerly direction until it vanished into a bank of clouds.  I kept recording, anticipating the object?s re-emergence from the cloud bank, but saw no further sign of the object.  It was much larger and more vivid in the sky than any aircraft I have previously encountered.  It burned very brightly and intensely, reminding me of nothing more than a launched rocket as it may appear shortly after lift-off, while still travelling through Earth?s atmosphere.  It was that appearance which caused me to make the reports and requests for information I made.  Being a Cold war Veteran, I could not help but equate what I saw with a possible missile launch.

Being concerned for the safety of persons, I called Bishop International Airport, MI Air National Guard, MUFON, as well as local news agencies who I asked if they had received reports of this event-all replied that they had NOT received similar reports from other persons. Several suggested that I report the sighting to police, which I did NOT do. Whether Terrestrial or Extra terrestrial, there was no crime which I observed being committed or anything which I would perceive as falling under ?Police Jurisdiction?.

The Officer I spoke with from Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center spoke to his Base Commander, who had previously served at Wright Patterson AFB in Ohio, and the Commander stated that the USAF does not ?officially recognize UFOs? and cannot, therefore, take reports concerning the sighting thereof.  He recommended I contact the National UFO Reporting Service and provided me with the number and website information to do so.  I am now doing so.

It was about 10:50pm EST. My wife and I were walking outside to her car, as she had to go to work and I was seeing her off.  I looked to the west and saw a yellow-orange light in the west, heading east, coming towards us. 

At first I thought it was an aircraft, possibly a helicopter, as there is a trauma flight helo pad a couple blocks away and it was moving at a slow rate of speed.  But there was no noise. I then pointed it out to my wife.  Then we both thought it might be meteor, as is did seem to be flaming and shedding very small sparks.  The sparks were few and very small, coming both from the rear of the object, as well as the sides toward the rear.

But the sky is overcast (rained all day) and the object was below the cloud cover.

The object wasn?t perfectly round, nor oval, nor did it have a long tail. It did seem to have almost a ?bullet with wings? shape, as it passed more sidelong to us, like the flame was forming some kind of small ?wings?.  They weren?t wings, but the flame, the closer it got, spread out in a short winged shape  The object seemed to curve to the NE.

UFO Sighting in Bossier City, Louisiana on June 23rd 2013 - Aerial multiple-lights  At 2100I was standing outside with my wife looking at the supermoon rising in the east, when I saw an unusual orange-reddish light due NW that brighter than any stars or antenna masts markers in the sky.  It was slightly moving N-NW , then stopped for about 45sec, then traveled SE, then changed direction instantly moving NNW again,  it was at an unknown distance, but no more than a mile or two away at a 45 degree angle. It?s orange red color was steady for about 3 minutes while traveling NNW, then became a little dimmer as it changed direction south, then dimmed and resembled a star for a minute and was stationary, then became even brighter and began traveling NNW again. But not as fast as it was originally for about 2 minutes.  The light then dimmed and resembled a star for about 3 minutes, then disappeared entirely.  My home is directly above the landing path for Barksdale AFB, and being prior military and having B-52s and all kinds of other planes flying and approaching at all times of the day and night I a certain this was not a plane or jet. There is no jet engine or strobe light in the world that can put out the light we saw, or move and hover like this. 

My wife and I had our suspicions about the UFO, but on my way to work the next morning the local radio station KVKI DJ was talking all morning abouta UFO that approached Barksdale AFB airspace, the tower hailed it 3 times to no avail and dispatched fighters. Who knows what they saw, but this area, particularly the AFB has had numerous sightings over the past few years & with the base housing half of our nuclear bombs & missiles, why not come check it out?

I got home from work and took my dog out on a leash to the yard and as we were walking around the yard I looked up at the sky as I always do and have for years because I love trying to spot the big dipper and little dipper and seeing the moon and all the stars... 

And all of a sudden coming over one of the tall trees I see a huge and very bright orange/red light and it was about as big as the full moon but it was moving my way and from behind it came another and then another, and another, like bullets shooting out and I'm standing there thinking and saying out loud to myself what in the world is this! 

I thought maybe weather balloons or hot air balloons, or parachutes.  I just didn't know and still have no idea.

I looked around to see if anyone else was out and of course there was no one but me and my little Shit-zu, who could care less and I've never seen anything like it.  

There was no sound and as the bright orange/red ball of light traveled it got higher and dimmer until you could finally tell that it was a boomerang shape and the intensity of the color diminished to an amber sort of glow until finally they turned black, but you could still see them flying across the sky, just like you can see a bat in the sky at night.  

I saw 3 of them end up flying side by side and I ran to get my camera but by the time I got back outside they were so high and almost gone that they look almost like nothing but a joke, but believe me it's not a joke and these things were something! 

You can only see 2 of them from the picture I was able to get and you can see one is more brighter in color than the other because this is how they went in intensity. 

I so wish that I would have had my camera on me and been able to take the picture when they first started out because believe me that had my complete and full attention.

Hi, due to the nature of this incident it occurred next to a navy base.  What I can't explain truthfully was why it had a strange eerie glow emanating from it.  The green white colors and comet like tail was the most profound thing I have ever seen on this planet.  It couldn't have been a missile test.  Rockets don't make strange colors like that and it appeared so beautiful like I had died and seen an angel.  

Before I talk more I'd like to explain to the reader who I am.  I am 28 now this occurred 2 years ago.  I have been diagnosed by a medical doctor with no phychological problems except a mild form of ptsd from the past.   

What I saw was witnessed by another older man in his 40s.  We were both on the same road driving on highway 1 from santa monica to oxnard , right around mugu rock all of a sudden my vehicle shut down completely , no lights no engine slowly stalled to a stop on the pullout.  The man in his dodge charger in front of me stopped too about 30 yds ahead.  These were the only vehicles on the road that night me and him.  

Okay so when I got out to investigate the disturbance I got the weird feeling and looking over the ocean and the other man looking to saw the object, it was so amazing I could not believe what I was seeing all my years in college I could not explain in physics how the object moved with no noise at all.  I thought I was seeing something paranormal but I don't believe in ghosts so scratch that thought.  

The object moved so slow and it went back towards the horizon but at first it was close then as it disappeared the cars miraculously started up.  I never believed in ufos before now I'm definitely a believer.  I thought I was witnessing a miracle but nothing really happened it appeared and that was it. 

I'm sorry I did not have a cam phone to record it at the time all I can say are words.

I was coming from lax airport at the time.

 My next door neighbor was coming out of his front door about this time and we saw this same thing happen multiple times.  With the sheer amazement of what we were seeing neither of us could honestly say how many there actually were.  Our best conclusion was at least seven in total. 

I can not speculate nor even guess at an approximate speed. Growing up, my father was a fighter pilot in the USAF.  After retiring continued his career in aviation.  I my self have  done my share of private flying.  I feel that I can honestly say that I have been around enough fast planes to know that these were no airplanes.  It almost looked as if missiles were being launched.  I thought at the time about the possibility of fireworks.  There never were any explosions. 

I went as far as calling 911 non emergency to see if anyone else had reported this event while it was taking place.  The dispatcher I spoke with was not aware at the time of any calls.

8/4/13--  I was sitting in my back yard last night with 2 friends discussing a upcoming vacation.   It was about 11:30pm pst.   I was facing directly East,  and was looking up at the stars ( because normally you can't see them...). It was slightly cloudy,  kind of hazy out and in the mid 60's.   The eastern sky was the only area of the sky that had visible stars.   At some point around 11:30ish I noticed a bright orangish red ball flying above the the hills,  right above Mt. Hamilton.   I stared at it for almost a minute before I knew for sure that what I was looking at was something I could not understand.   It looked like a ball of light and it moved like an airplane at first.  I then pointed it out to my 2 friends,  and let them know that I had been staring at this and can't figure it out.  They immediately thought it was an airplane,  due to the size and speed.  But then it seemed to stop in mid air,  not to mention it wasn't really moving in a straight ! line.  So then we thought it was a helicopter.  This also was disproved by the size and speed.   I would say it was the size of a 3-4 bedroom house or slightly bigger.   So it moved toward us, and seemed pretty low, but then moved away,  then North,  then back to the West,  back North again before it looked to be moving away from us upward!  When it moved it was either really slow or extremely fast.  It shot up into space and disappeared within about 10 seconds!  This ball thing also seemed to be changing color from red to orange,  and I think I could see the colors moving all around the ball.  At a certain point I could see light radiating from the ball in all directions.  It looked like seeing a red light through a wet window,  or like how a bright star looks in the distance.   This lasted at least 2 minutes.   I was then walking around my yard going through every possible explanation,  and one of my friends was also doing this.  The 3rd friend was in denial and kept maki! ng up excuses as to what it was,  but non of them made sense a! nd I cou ld disprove all of them.   After a few minutes we sat back down and attempted to restart our conversation.  I however couldn't stop staring East.  Then, after about 2-3 minutes from the last occurrence,  I saw it again!  Except this time I saw it immediately,  as it rose above the East hills.   I started yelling for everyone to look at it,  and scared them because it made me jump up.  This time we all 3 saw it from start to finish.   The weird thing was that it took what seemed to be the same path as the 1st fire balls we saw.  A lot of discussion went on during this second one,  and all possible explanations were thrown out the door.  It was official,  what we were seeing defied all logic based on our knowledge and the available technology.   It was gone again,  after it shot off into space,  and we were all left staring up into the eastern sky wondering what the f@*k just happened.  Once again after a few minutes I spotted it again in almost the same spot.  The 3rd time we! were very big eyed and quiet just observing and inside freaking out.  After the 3rd occurrence I went inside the house and told my girlfriend to wake up and put her jacket on.  I had to have another witness, and someone to explain to me what was going on.   She came outside and we all told her what we saw.  By this time we were all climbing things to get a higher view,  and she thought we were nuts!  But just my luck it happened one last time.  The 4th time we saw it,  it seemed to get closer to us before it shot off into the horizon.  Also,  during the whole thing all of us saw several shooting stars each.  All of also can't remember ever seeing more than one shooting star ever in our lives,  from San Jose that is.   I got my 6ft. ladder out to get a better view,  thinking it would happen again.  What I saw over the top of my very tall fence,  on the very tops of the hills,  was some odd lights.  It looked like street lights but all the way on the top of the hills.  I've ! lived here 32 years,  and I consider myself a very observant p! erson.

I've never in my life seen lights on top of these hills.  I pointed them out to everyone and mentioned they were not normally there.   Everyone thought they were lights from someone's house on the mountain,  but I knew there are no homes there.   No more strange balls of fire showed up so we went and sat back down.  About 5 minutes later,  I got up and climbed up my ladder again.  When I looked to the top of the mountains,  the lights we saw were gone!  Also,  today with the sun up I used my binoculars to get a good view of that area,  and there is nothing there...  I don't know what we saw.  But it wasn't an airplane,  helicopter, remotely operated device, wasn't a meteor, missile, rocket, weather balloon,  and took off into space.

I was curious about that aircraft for two reasons 1.  I am a private pilot and generally enjoy seeing aircraft flying over and 2. I had watched my daughter and son-in-law arrive along the same track two nights ago while they were returning on a flight from Philadelphia to Miami (I had been watching their progress via the internet flight tracking software.  I looked up a couple of minutes after that aircraft passed to the south and saw another light in the sky at about the same altitude and location.  This light was white in color and looked like a landing light.  It almost looked like a satellite but without the speed one would normally see.   Within a couple of seconds I noticed a green light behind the white light (to the left of the light, or North).  A seco! nd later there was a sudden bright intensity that looked like a rocket separating from its booster, a bright center with the shape of a brilliant triangle with the original light at the tip pointing out towards the east.  The light shape lasted only a couple of seconds and then disappeared.  I lost sight of the light for a second or two and when I next located the same position in the sky there appeared to be two green lights separated by about ?? at arms length.  The green lights remained separated by a fixed distance while the lights appeared to move towards the east.  Living in Florida for the past 40 years I?ve seen my share of rocket launches, this was in the wrong location for a rocket coming out of Cape Canaveral.  The shape and color of the contrail looked just like a rocket separation.  My best guess was a missile that was dropped from a launch plane, engine ignited and flamed out after a few seconds.  Very strange.

I am a private pilot and retired Deputy fire chief.  I am an avid aviation enthusiast and monitor launch schedules from the Cape and satellite sighting via iPhone software.  This was the most unusual sighting I have seen, mostly because of the location being so close to West Palm Beach and the commercial airways to and from Ft. Lauderdale and Miami

On June 28, 1996, I was 17 and riding passenger-side by my mother. It was 7PM and still very sunny and clear. We came out of the grocery store and got in the car. We were driving west down Guadalupe Rd. in Tempe, AZ. My mother gasped, leaned forward to look into the sky and pointed at something. I leaned forward too. We saw a silvery streaked object falling southwesterly at a 120? angle against the blue sky. It was leaving a small tail behind it but not falling as fast as a meteorite and much bigger and duller than a meteorite. My first thought was space debris or a missile.

But then it stopped suddenly about 50? above the horizon. When that happened, the tail ended, the shape changed to spherical and the color went to a lustrous pearl color. It appeared to be over South Mountain, maybe 5 miles away.  My mom managed to drive home.

A few minutes later, we drove into our parking lot, having never lost sight over the treeline. From the parking lot, I ran into the apartment to grab my binocs, at which point I informed my dad and sister that there was a UFO outside.  I ran back out, rejoining my mom. All four of us watched it.  The bottom had opened up into a ?V? shape and it seemed like hot gases were coming out of the bottom, like the steam rising from car hoods in the summer. It was soundless.

I was the only one who saw it through the binocs and when I looked, I saw little sparks flying off the pearly surface, which flew chaotically around the UFO and would fizzle out, as if composed of electricity.  I also saw more specifically clear-colored heat waves coming out of the ?V? shape.

The UFO hovered there while people on the street were calmly driving their cars past us. It seemed to hover in exactly the same place in the air while the Earth turned underneath it. Sunset approached and after thirty to forty minutes, it was getting further away and more back against the horizon.  It seemed to be over Estrella Mountain at this point.  It was going to disappear soon. The sun was already down below the horizon so we just turned and left at around 7:30 PM.

We watched the news that night expecting it to make the news.  We were frustrated that it didn't. Certainly in a city the size of Phoenix, people are not that busy.

I did write down all these details that very night and I called Luke Air Force Base, spoke with a secretary and asked her if anything strange was seen on the radar.  She was nonplussed about my UFO sighting.  I have since learned that on that day, there was a funeral procession for a fallen soldier at Luke Air Force Base at appr. 7PM and so somebody at the base must have seen it.  Personally, I think it was experimental unmanned aircraft out of the NASA testing facility south in Maricopa.","unemployed",4,1,"changing",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1996,1990,2,6,19,"Evening","West",0,1,0,0,0

THIRD SIGHTING IN 3 NIGHTS OF A SILVER-GOLD, ELONGATED/FOOTBALL SHAPED UFOS EMERGING FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO AND POSSIBLE SECOND SIGHTING OF A BRILLIANT BLUE-GREEN UFO THAT ?SHOT? A PROJECTILE OR BEAM OF LIGHT INTO THE AIR I arrived at my regular skywatch location at 9:15 p.m. on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, USA, just north of the rock jetty at Blind Pass.  This was the third night in a row that I had been out because of what I had seen two nights ago.  The weather was totally overcast and dead calm, but there was sufficient moonlight to see the horizon of the entire Gulf of Mexico.   The moon was almost half full and high in the sky when I first arrived.

 At approximately 9:45 a dim yellowish light appeared on the horizon just a little west/seaward of where I previously had seen the football shaped craft on previous nights.  I then got it in view with my binoculars and again saw two of the whitish-gold craft, side by side, right on the horizon at the water?s surface.  I think that they could have possibly come out of the water based on what I previously seen, except that these objects were fully formed ? I did not see the little ?blob? of light get bigger and turn into the craft like I?d previously seen.  I watched these objects for a short while as they pretty much stayed in place before disappearing.

 At 10:13 p.m. I saw to the NNW of me, in the same area that the previous nights UFO?s appeared, a brilliant, ?crystalline,? green-blue, flashing light, about the size of a pea at arms length.  It was no more than 4 or 5 miles away from me, well inside of the horizon.  It would come on for a short second, go off for a short second, etc. 5 to 7 times each time it came on.  It would stay off for perhaps a minute or two before coming back on.  After the first 4 or 5 times that it came on, it started slowly getting dimmer, and then I realized that it was moving way from me, just west of NNW, at an angle out to sea.

 I watched this object for about 20 minutes before the !#@#%! Sand flies drove me off the beach.  I quickly went home across the street, soaked myself in OFF, and went back to my location.  By this time, 10:40, the light had turned mostly white with a bit of green in, and was barely visible with the naked eye.  It was still within the horizon though, close to 7 miles away.  I was watching it with my binoculars when the flashing became a consistent on and off, in a strange way.  It would take a long second to come on to the brightness that it would get, like on a slow dimmer switch, and then go off like a switch was thrown.  stay  I was somewhat, and the thought that came to mind was that it was ?struggling, huffing and puffing,? getting to where it was just visible with my binocs.  Then, and this was scary, it brightened one last time and stayed on for a full second, and ?shot? what looked like a short beam of light, or the light from some kind of a projectile, nearly straigh! t up in the air!  The section of ?light beam? that I saw was maybe 60 to 80 feet long, perhaps even longer, as it was some distance away.  I guess it resembled the flash that comes out of the muzzle of a gun.  With 0 degrees being straight up, I would say that this short ?beam flash? was at 10 degrees off of vertical, and toward the NW.  It seemed like the flash was going away from me and to the left a bit ? it was very clearly defined.  I heard no sounds and it rather shocked and scared me when this happened.  I saw nothing else for about 10 minutes and I was glad to go home.

 I?ve been lucky enough to see some really strange things out here, and even seeing a ?normal? UFO seems like it would have been better that this.  I have absolutely no clue as to what it was that I was watching, especially considering that it changed colors and changed its rate of pulsations.  To think that it may have shot something up in the air just frightens me.

 While writing this report, and after having thought about it for a while, the color of this light was greener than the blue-green light I had filed in ?Sighting #9? for July 12, 2013.

I was fishing with a friend on tims ford lake about 8 oclock at night and it was clear and the stars were showing and there was about 10 or 15 other boats in the area and this blueish lit craft came out over the water and i told the person with me to look at that and as i pointed at it it lite up brighter than the sun and took off across the sky faster than a bullet.  

When i pointed at it i would say it was about a 100 feet from us and was so bright we had to look away from it and for a few seconds it lit the area about a 1/2 a mile around us so bright you could count the leaves on the trees and was 15 miles away on the horizon in less the 2 or 3 seconds.

The next rocket fire appeared 10 minutes later in the sky at the same position as the first one appeared.  There were a total of 4 rockets seen.

 Each rocket followed the same trajectory and at one point, two rockets could be seen, one overhead and one in the distance.  There may have been more than four rockets.  The witnesses only saw four.  The sightings were made from Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod.  All four witnesses were sober.

 The rockets themselves could not be seen.   What was visible to naked eye was a fire ball similar to ones seen from rockets launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in the 1970s and 1980s.

 The witnesses considered the possibility of the phenomena being airplanes.  They dismissed this possibility, as the fire was very bright and burned steady as the rockets ascended.  There were no standard flashing lights as seen on most private and commercial aircraft.

 We have scanned the news sights for other sightings.  None have been found at this point.

 The witnesses talked with other areas residents, most had seen nothing, Two said they spotted at least on rocket crossing the sky.

UFO Report Sighting date: 9/01/13 Time of Sighting: approximately 20:40 P.M. P.D.T.

Location of Sighting: 15 miles north of Santa Barbara, Ca.

LATITUDE: 34.46226N  LONGITUDE: 120.02726W El Capitan State Beach Tonight at approximately 20:40, I witnessed a large triangular shaped vehicle with approximately 7 bright but muted or blurred lights* traveling at a slow speed headed due East towards Santa Barbara California. Craft made no sounds.

The vehicle caught my eye initially because of the color of the lights.* The vehicles altitude is hard to judge because it was dark but if I had to guess I would say approximately 1500 to 2000 feet. If, that guess is correct that would make the size of the craft maybe three times the size of a Boeing 747.

The craft was witnessed by myself and I was accompanied by wife and there were approximately 15 guest of the park who witnessed the craft at the same time.

I brought the vehicle to the attention of the group and asked if they were in fact seeing what I was witnessing?  All answered in the affirmative.

The vehicle was moving so slowly we all got a good look at its speed, then it appeared to come to a complete stop, but only momentarily.  Then the vehicle began to move in a forward direction but also appeared to be headed in a vertical direction.  We continued to monitor the vehicle its movement was vertical and slowly east. It then began to appear to gain momentum but suddenly it disappeared.

Initially, I thought it may have been an aircraft of some sort because we are on the approach to the Santa Barbara Airport.

I also thought that it may have been an aircraft from Vandenburg Air Force Base, which is just to the north of the park approximately 30 miles.  Although it is my understanding that no flight wing exists at VFB, I have witnessed missile launches from that base, both daytime and night launches, none of those launches were anything even remotely like the vehicle we witnessed tonight.  No craft I have ever seen have the ability to accelerate so quickly that they disappear.

Having witnessed hundreds of commercial as well as private and military aircraft I knew this was not any of those aircraft at least of the type I had ever witnessed.

I must mention that during my career I spent 6 years working in the Mojave, California area, where my office was on the perimeter of the Mojave Air and Space Port as well as our neighbors to the southeast Edwards Air Force Base. I have witnessed thousands of aircraft flying in and out of both of these facilities as well as China Lake Naval Weapons Station which aircraft are in the air almost constantly.

The vehicle that was flying over the Park this evening was like nothing I or any of the other witnessed that I discussed the sighting with tonight had ever seen.

I then traveled to the other side of the park and spoke to another guest who was a retired firefighter and his wife, they too saw the vehicle and were unable to explain the vehicle in any other terms than, ""We saw a UFO this evening"".

The behavior of this vehicle is like nothing commercial, private or military I have ever witnessed. *Nor was the lighting, the color of the lights were something between yellow and orange and very bright.

At 1234 hrs I went outside to have a cigarette on my front porch. As it is a somewhat cloud filled day I was looking up in the SSW area of the sky.  Today it is a puffy white cloud, with a deep blue sky.  As I was viewing the sky, looking at the perfect clouds and looking in between them, I noticed a object.  This object was descending directly towards the ground. It was easy to determine this as most aircraft traversing the sky would appear to be moving from North to Nourth or East to west or reverse.  This object was clearly dropping and not traversing or ascending.

The gap between the clouds ?as I place my hand towards the sky- was from my thumb tip to my index finger tip with my arm completely extended outward and upward.  The object was straight (like a missile) and was white or bright in color.  It appeared to be somewhat ribbed or sectioned (possibly marked but clearly not one solid blank piece).  It traveled through this ?gap? in the clouds in about 5 seconds.  Due to there being large and extended clouds lower on the horizon from whence this object passed behind the second cloud (my thumb) I could not see it immerge on the other side.

I was sitting on my couch at 7:30pm pacific time looking out of the window when I saw an orange streak in the sky. I watched it move slowly from north to south. I called my 18 year old son in to look at it too. He said it could be a jet and my 15 year old son said he thought it was a missile.  It was a sparkling ball with an orange tail behind it.  It went across the sky until it disappeared behind the mountain range.  Within 5 minutes, I saw a jet following the same course in the same direction. I don't know if the jet was trying to follow the fireball or is it was unrelated.

This strange light in the sky was coming toward my house.  It got right over the top of a particular tree in my front yard.  The first photo taken was of the craft directly over the large tree, above my garden plot.  The sky was black and no craft could be seen, only the energy from it.  It was a circle of flaming fiery red that had a thin layer of emanating heat, bellowing around it that looked like delicate lace on the sides of the red fiery ball or flaming circle.  Another photo taken showed the fiery red circle with an almost white central section with 4 white lights.  It moved silently, looked to be about 4 feet in diameter and flat, then flew across the street, staying just above the trees.  You could feel the energy from it hitting your face and hands.  The after effects of this caused the hands to itch with the fingers turning reddish.  Then the craft appeared to detected our presence and started to fly off.  The craft accelerated quickly and left a trail of bright glowing blue.  Much like the color of the blue gas flame on your stove, but a little darker and almost florescent.  You could see the front of the blue image bending the air back, similar to photo's of projectiles like bullets going through the air.  Then it accelerated at a phenomenal speed, darting out of sight.  We've never seen anything move that fast before.

That night, the observer thought he had a dream that 3 guys had been in his room, at least one coming in through the wall of his bedroom.  The next morning he had a horrible headache.  His camera was on his table, but the camera's chip was gone.  There were no photo's at all in the camera.  His journal book was still there, but all the pages for Saturday night had all been torn out.  Even though it gave him a headache, he tried to remember what seemed like a dream that Saturday night.  He said the men were handsomely dressed in black.  He drew a picture of the object they put on his head.  It resembled the shape of the skull cap priest use to wear.  Four little arms stretched out similar in shape to the priest's skull cap with spherical lights at the ends.  On top was an attached rectangle box.  The spherical lights, light up and he said could feel his body get real warm.  Then as they left, the leader was last and just before he vanished, he turned his head back, smiled and said, you'll be fine!!!!!  

Sunday, he had no memory of anything about Saturday and the strange craft.

I just witnessed 4 red lights in the sky tonight 12/6/2013 between 10:15pm-10:25pmET.

 I left my phone in my house, but I was out walking my dog because I heard 2 strange popping sounds - I thought maybe a neighbor was outside; so I went to inspect.

 Initially 1 red light caught my eye but I noticed another and then another, in all I saw 4 red lights.  At first I thought they were planes, but they seemed to be in a formation that I did not believe a passenger airline would use and the red light was uncommon. Then I thought they were potentially missiles because they were moving so fast, but they all disappeared. I am not sure if they just vanished or they were traveling so fast that it just went out of my sight.

 The skies are dark but clear. I can see stars clearly and these were not stars or shooting stars.

This report may be long overdue but I can recall it as though it occurred last summer.   It was mid August 1975. I was watching over and taking care of chores at my stepfather and Mothers 22000 acre Beef cattle and Quarter horse ranch.  My stepdad had gone to our summer range at Greys lake Idaho to ride through the herd at that place.  The ranch where this event occurred is a remote Desert mountain ranch in northwestern Box Elder County, Utah.  There is not, nor ever has been any electricity at this"" Fort"" ranch.  It is isolated and even now quite primitive.  The 15th of August 1975 was very dry and very hot.  It was about 90 to 95 degrees F. at just before 12 midnite.       

My mother was home, 80 miles to the east of where I was, she at our Logan Utah guest ranch, located on the Logan river..  The crickets at the Promontory Fort Ranch were chirping very rapidly outside the Bedroom window.  One can calculate about how hot it is by the speed that crickets chirp. that and I had inside-outside thermometers.  

I was laying on the bed in the houses only bedroom reading a book.  The ranch cowdog  a Border collie was plopped down right next to me on the rug to the side of the bed.  I was reading by the propane powered lamp on the wall above my head.   

I was 22 years old at the time,and I had 20/10 vision in both eyes.  This ranch is located 20 miles south by southwest of Thiokol Chemical Corp, where several stages of Intercontinental missle boosters and their propellant was made for the United States air force in support of continental defense/strategic Nuclear weapon systems, and later on, the NASA space shuttle solid rocket boosters. (1950 to 2005)  Now known as ATK space  systems and related subsidararies    

The crickets stopped chirping.  The dog started fidgeting.  The dog started whimpering then whining this eerie mournful, pitiful cry, it got intense.  The poor animal began to exhibit terror at someone or something that was approaching. absolutely panic stricken.  Then, it started to paw and dig into the wallpaper and plaster of the rooms corner.  It tore clear through to the lath and was frantically pawing to get through even that.  I could not hear any sound, except for the freaked- out dog.  

Then the horses started to act up and they became terribly agitated.  The horses whinnied and snorted.  They squealed and stampeded around the round corral that they were in next to the barn.  The barn was south of the ranch house and slightly below the main house about 20 yards away from me.  

There were four saddle horses all of them geldings.  All of them gentle, with no previous signs of skittishness or jumpiness.  These working cow cutting horses were about as Bombproof, bullet proof dog-gentle-reliable as a mount could get.  At least before this incident.   They were desperately trying to get out of the corral and could not quite jump over the tall fence made of upright railroad ties.  I remember thinking that a rocky Mountain Cougar might be stalking my horses, so I retrieved all of t! he ranch weapons from their cache, loaded them and lay them squarely on the bed.  I short time earlier, maybe two months, a bobcat had been on the tin roof of the barn and had to be shot off, lest he sprang on the peafowl and chickens  

That was another thing, none of the ranch chickens or peafowl seemed to be anywhere around and I didn't see the black cat that was usually hanging around the porch.  

Then there was this light.  The light was a  bright red orange.  It was more than bright, it was intensely bright, it was shining in from through  the west window.  I went over to the window to look.  I was nervous and had a vague feeling of apprehension about the situation up to now, but then I saw it.  It was a saucer.  A FLYING SAUCER!  the damn thing was positioned a little over a block to the west of the house.  It shone bright red orange.  The light was just glowing right out of the steel skin or whatever metal it was.  This thing was hovering about four hundred feet in the air.  It floated silently. there were no rotors. There were no propellers.  There were no jet engines, no rocket thrusters or any visible means of how it moved.  I estimate that the craft was 300 feet in diameter.  It was fifty feet high and believe there was a dome or protrusion on top. I did not see any beings or creatures. there were no windows or portals visible. It looked exactly like the shape of two tin pie pans hooked together into classic science fiction  Flying Saucer shape.  The strong light that it emitted cast shadows from the cedar fence posts , the fence line, the sagebrush and the greasewood all around and under it.the entire desert alkalai floor was lit up bright as day under and around it .there was a large alfalfa haystack near where I first observed this ship .The haystack cast a large grotesque shadow by this things light.  Again, it made no sound, but its presence and possibly whatever emanated from it scared the hell out of the dog ,the horses and me! I was crying, sweating profusely , and ready to pee my pants all at once. what wa! s most terrifying to me was, as I looked upon it   I suddenly knew it was watching me and it was aware that   I was there. THE best description of what it was... and this is deeply ingrained upon me; a living machine. It didn't just strike me as being evil IT was evil. Malevolant not friendly or here to help mankind. also I just knew this thing was capable of killing with no qualms. I just knew this and other things about it, it communicated via telepathy , and I didn't like it. I didn't like it trespassing or being there at all and the living intelligent saucer read my mind enough to know that I would fight and resist  if I could. I may have been abducted . I do not think I was but I might have been. I don't know how long I stared at it maybe  a few minutes. suddenly it floated over the house and as it did, the tin roof on the barn and bunkhouse rattled and so did all the dishes in the pantry then it shot off to the southeast end of the ranch to the pasture we call the ros! ebushes .it is a boggy wetland of marshes cattails and deed we! t and dr y sand .     many wild rows of rosebushes grow there.it is on the shoreline of the great Salt Lake located on the north end of one arm of the lake. this Craft hovered above the rosebush pasture twelve mile southeast. It moved from overhead to the rosebushes in much less than half a seconds time. The next development was two U.S. Airforce Jets approached from the Northwest.  these two jets in formation flew over the house at 1210 a,m. so low that the jetwash stirred up dust in the yard after they went by.  Probably didn't help calm the horses down any as they passed either.  They were F-105 thunderchief Fighter bombers,  nuclear capable. before these heavy bombers got much past the house,  not even within 11 miles of the saucer, it shot right straight up and winked out. It didn't fade off into space, like you could see it fade away with distance, it reached  a speed around ten thousand feet above ground level and disappeared.  The fighters continued on around the west side of th! e lower promontory peninsula and drose up in altitude curving around the point toward Salt Lake City  or Ogdens Hill Air force base,and they too were gone.","Cowboy ,tea party lead, Author",0,0,"disk",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1975,1970,3,8,0,"Night","West",0,1,0,0,0

At dusk, on February 18, 2014, at 19:16, local time, while out for my evening walk, I spotted 3 orange orbs, approximately 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon, to the west, south west of my position, roughly 6 miles south of Picture Rocks, AZ.

These lighted orange orbs were near my winter home, west of Tucson, AZ, and this was not my first sighting.

The 3 orange orbs first appeared by blinking on; first just one, then two, and then three, total.  All 3 briefly became visible at the same time.  First one would blink on, then another, and so on, then one would blink off then back on in random sequence etc.  All three were totally silent, and left no visible smoke, plasma trail or contrail etc.

While visible, they appeared to have a very low ground speed, however, with no range or size information, I could not determine their exact speed, altitude or location.  They were arranged in an approximate north/south line from my vantage point, looking west southwest toward the fading sunset, and they did not dart or zoom back and forth.

They were only in view for a few seconds, and I pulled out my cell phone to photograph them, but it was too dark.  All three then blinked out within 30 seconds or so, and I noted the time as 19:16, on my cell phone.

Having occasionally seen these groups of reddish orange orbs at this location before, I attempted to take a photograph this time, because the sightings appear to be occurring more and more frequently, during the three years I have been wintering over here.

There is a lot of regular air traffic in this area, from SWA B-737's, AAL MD-80's, to CRJ 50 and 700 series commuter jets, plus a lot of G/A traffic going into TUS, and Ryan Airfield, located 10nm South and Marana Airport, about 11nm north.

I also spot numerous military aircraft over flying this area daily, including KC-135's, C-130's, F-16's, A-10's, Blackhawks and Cobra helicopters etc., mostly operating out of DM AFB or TUS.

Additionally, both my neighbor and I operate Hot Air balloons, (mine is a Balloon Works AX-8-B,  90,000 cubic feet) so I am quite familiar with the local traffic patterns, and most types of aircraft in this area.

I am also familiar with the difference in color spectrum between tungsten, XENON, HALOGEN, and LED landing lights, and or position/strobe lights, which these orange orbs were not.

Just prior to this sighting, there was a flight of two A-10 Warthogs, departing Davis Monthan AFB, on their routine evening patrol.   I see them often, and can recognize them by their two distinctive white flashing strobes.

The A-10's were climbing away from my position, westbound, in loose formation, about 250 to 300 knots, at approximately 10,000 feet.  As they disappeared to the west, the orbs appeared behind them, a few minutes later.

Shortly after the orbs briefly appeared, and then blinked out, I noticed a small single engine aircraft, southbound, approximately 5 to 10 miles west of my position, around 5 to 7 thousand feet.  I could hear its single engine, and see its steady red position light, as well as its red anti-collision light flashing.  Its ground speed appeared to be 80 to 110 kts but it was too dark to determine the specific type.

This aircraft may be the reason for the orbs blinking out, because it appeared to fly through the same area, shortly after the orbs disappeared.  I continued watching for them to reappear, as I walked about two miles back home (approximately 15 min's)  By then it was completely dark, and the objects did not reappear.

Over the past 3 years, I have seen these objects around half a dozen times, usually in groups of two to five objects, to the west of my home, mostly in the evening, or early morning hours, and generally low on the west southwest horizon, as opposed to overhead.

These internally lit, orange orbs were not parachute flares, balloons, helicopters, fixed wing jets or reciprocating G/A aircraft.

They were also not candle powered toy hot air balloons, which my neighbors launch in the evening, from time to time.

Having watched the Apollo-17 night launch in person, (DEC 1972), two shuttle launches, and one night shuttle reentry over the South Pacific, (Eileen Collins, Commander), plus a couple of Vandenburg, AFB night missile launches, I am certain these orbs were not chemical powered rockets, either lifting off or on reentry, or the space station.

Also they are not the Moon or Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Sirius etc. (wrong color, wrong location)  I can reasonably eliminate all the objects, planets, aircraft and vehicles that I have listed in this report, but I cannot identify what these orbs are.

After waiting a little over one hour, I called the hotline and made a verbal report to Peter Davenport around 20:42 local time.

I have not previously made a formal report, due to my position in professional aviation.

I have seen these orange orbs often enough to confirm they are not my imagination, and feel that my report should be made now, because the sightings appear to be happening more and more frequently.

If I were here full time, and had the time to spend looking, I feel that I could probably spot them fairly often in this area.  (just my speculation)  Because I am actively employed in a professional flying position, I must remain anonymous, however, I am more than willing to speak with an investigator.

Thanks for taking my report and I hope it is useful.

While watching our new puppy in my back yard (facing south) a distant flicker of light caught my eye.  It was bright red to orange in color, appeared to be spherical in shape or emitting an intense light for its altitude.  The object moved much quicker than any other aircraft at high altitude that I have personally seen, a supersonic pace. 

I tracked the object in a west/southwest to east/northeast movement losing the object behind cloud cover.  It appeared to have been above 25,000 ft, with an international airport/AFB 25 miles away I get to see a lot of air traffic at night.

I looked up at the sky as I left the Costco Warehouse and noticed lots of chemtrails crisscrossing the beautiful blue sky.  As I was gazing up, I noticed a silver bullet shaped object hovering stationary way up in the sky to the right of Costco between 2nd & 3rd Avenue, around 35th Street.  

I looked down and back up and saw that the object was still there not moving.  It did not have any wings or propellers.  It was not a blimp.  No sound coming from it.  It was silent and silverbullet shaped and stationary high up.  

I took out my camera to try and photograph it, but my zoom was not working properly.  As I looked up again, I noticed a airplane heading towards its direction.  As the airplane got closer towards the object...the object (UFO) simple disappeared!  Vanished right before my eyes!  

I looked all around the sky and nothing!  Where did it go?

I was smoking a cigarette in the back yard while letting my dogs go to the bathroom.  I noticed mt dogs had all stopped running around and were sniffing at the sky , as though they were trying to scent something.  I started looking at the sky through the trees in the direction they were looking and I saw an object moving about as fast as a jet.  It seemed to be a normal occurrence but the color was off, it didn't have the normal hue of lights a plane or helicopter would have, no red or blue flashing lights, and there wasn't a tail so it didn't appear to be a meteor or falling star.  

I ran inside my house to grab my phone, I figured the rate of speed it was moving I'd have plenty of time to get some footage.  I couldn't have been more than 5-10 seconds and I went out my front door for a better angle.  I know my timing was accurate, it had only crossed the back left corner of my back yard, it should have been in view but it seemingly disappeared.  No idea what it could've been, but I believe I definitely saw something unusual tonight.  

As a fire control technician in the navy's submarine force, I was trained in celestial navigation and had extensive training in identifying aircraft from a distance.  This was no normal aircraft.  Possibly a rocket or missile but again, there was no flame or tail.

We were at the drive in theater when I was 7 when my mother noticed something to her right coming from the east.  She gasped and got everyone's attention by saying something about it.  

It was large, big enough to cover the entire drive in.  It was oval to oblong shaped and had a glowing reddish-orange light.  It was silent and moved very slow and consistent.   As it passed over head my mom was telling us to duck down and don't look. 

Well, I was curious and tried to watch it as much as I could.  As soon as it was flying over people panicked and tried to leave the drive in.  So we did too but we wanted to try to follow it but had no luck.  As we had seen strange lights, usually white float on by nearby.  

One night we spent an hour or so driving around trying to keep an eye on one.  In 1976, there was a ball of light perched on top of a mountain you could see off in the distance.  My mother woke everyone to see.  

It sat there after I woke to watch for about a half an hour an! d then it zipped almost seamlessly to the next mountain top over.  Which I have seen to be about 5 miles apart.  

It stopped dead on the top of that mountain.  It sat there for about 45 min. to an hour before it shot off faster than a bullet.

It was June of 1965, and I was just out of High School and on my way on a bus to Sonoma California Security Base for high (above top secret) Naval Security training.  It was a clear day as the bus rolled through the rolling hills of Central California.  I glanced through the right side window where I sat to admire the golden California countryside.  I saw hovering over the mountains in the distance a huge object.  I assumed it was a dirigible the Navy used to use during the Second World War to observe the ocean front property where they kept an eye open for enemy subs and such.  Then I realized it had been keeping up with the bus for over an hour.  The mountains in the distance were high, but this cigar shaped thing dwarfed the mountains it hovered over.  I knew then and there it was a different kind of craft than a dirigible because I had studied the history of dirigibles and knew they could not move that fast.  I also realized that dirigibles were not as big as this thing was.  Keeping in mind that I was in Central California where things look closer than they really are, it had to be longer than fourteen football fields, it was huge, far longer than any conventional dirigibles being used at the time, or at any other time in military history.  

I was on my way to a secret Naval Security Base with a Top Secret Clearance, so there was no way I was going to report the incident or I would have been chipping paint on a submarine for the rest of my Naval career.  I was trained as a Communications Tech and knew how to spot unusual objects in the sky (because that was my job), and spent years on a ship (in plotting) during the Viet Nam era, where I used all available equipment to track and plot each aircraft over and off Viet Nam soil.  I had pics but we were never allowed to keep a private camera (because of what we saw daily).  The only pics I had were OKd by the training head of Naval Security in our sector, which I do not want to mention.  

Wish I had hidden a few, they were something to see.  

I attest to this fact, and to other sightings during various conflict actions during the years 1966 and 1968 in and around the Viet Nam conflict.  The cigar shaped one was only the first, many more followed.  I guess this happened because my job in the military always had to do with Top Secret Operations, and I?m sure they (whoever they are) kept an open eye on everything we did.

One time I swear someone (or something) saved our guys on four River Gun Boats (three man crews) when they did their best to hold five North Vietnam Junks full of guns and explosives until the sun came up so they could check them for illegal weapons and such and to take prisoners.  I was on duty on the Bridge with my Flak Jacket and Helmet when suddenly all hell broke loose.  The Junks all began to fire at the River Boats (at me too).  The River Boat crews held their own as best they could, but I saw several of the crew hit badly during the fight.  

All of the sudden four of the five Junks were blown out of the water by some unseen friend overhead. They just exploded into oblivion, no residual left.  I saw only one flash, what looked like a lightning strike, hit a Junk and it exploded.  I hit the deck when bullets started hitting all around my head.  The last Junk gave up quickly, and our ship took credit for the save.  I saw it, I know we did not do it, but since truth is stranger than fiction so I left it at that.  

Thank you friends whoever you were.  You saved our guys.

But all I have to offer is my word, no pics.  Please do not ever mention my name over the air because I am still bound by my Top Secret Clearance (for life) and could be in lots of do-do.

UFO Combat Contact  Date: October 15th 2009 @ 0300 in the morning.

 Location: Al-Iskandariyah, Iraq  Brief background of me at time of incident: I was a 11B (Infantry) RTO (Radio Transmitter Operator)  Description of event:  The night started out as a basic patrol from FOB (Forward Operating Base) Chosen. The base was located at the Al-Iskandariyah power station.  Everything went as normal when our convoy came under attack from insurgent forces.  As the RTO of the convoy, I was directing communication from the convoy to the base. The attack happened at the government housing that we called ?The projects.?  The housing was setup as multi-level apartment complexes surrounded on all sides by farmland with the road going up the eastern side of the complex.  Power was scarce in the area so there was no electricity at night.

	The encounter happened about 15 minutes into the firefight.  I was standing by the driver door of the HMMWV (Military Vehicle, similar to a civilian Hummer H1) coordinating the attack and directing support with the Lieutenant. Facing west, the UFO just appeared out of nowhere.  I was looking directly at the craft when it appeared.  The craft was dead silent, had a dark hull, non-reflective, appeared cigar shaped from my angle, and had a series of blue lights on the bottom and top.  The craft was about 100 meters away from us and about 150 meters off the ground.  The craft was dead still and had no sway or movement at all.

	About 30 seconds after it appeared, the (Singars) Radio?s in the HMMWV immediately started to emit a steady tone.  Our vehicle was equipped with 3 radio?s (One for platoon, one for battalion, and one for aviation.)  Two of the radios where on VHF Frequencies and one was on a UHF Frequency.  All three radio?s started to emit a stead tone on all three radios at the same time.  Our handheld radios (MBTTR Radio) also emitted the same tone.  As I switched to the different channels, every single Freq was jammed with the same tone.

	The fire fight immediately stopped and a single shot was not fired by either us or the insurgents.  At the same time our communications were jammed, the electronics on the ITAS TOW Missile system went off line rendering the missile launcher and optics useless.  The craft stayed there motionless for about what I guess was 2 minutes when we heard 3 loud booms coming from our base.  After the booms, the craft immediately disappeared and all communications were restored.

	At FOB Chosen, the TOC (Tactical Operation Center) was monitoring our contact when they too witnessed the craft appear (as the base was only about 700 meters away from the craft).  Later when we returned to base, they told us to that they heard the same tone, not only from the VHF and UHF radio?, but also the tactical satellite radios.  At the same times, all the computers in the TOC went off line and became unresponsive.

	At the same time, our base had three 105mm howitzer artillery cannons loaded and on standby for our contact in case we needed them.  When the craft appeared, they lost all communications with everyone and their targeting computers went off-line.  The Staff sergeant in charge of the firing line, unable to get orders from the TOC, immediately identified the craft as the cause of the blackout and considered it hostile.  Without the targeting computers and no time to do calculation manually for the trajectory, he ordered the cannons to direct lay (Essentially pointing the cannons straight at the target, instead of lobbing the rounds) toward the craft and ordered a 3 round volley to be fired.  After the cannons fired, the craft disappeared.

When we returned to base for the AAR (After Action Review), no one could explain what we all saw.  After the artillery fired and neither us in the field or the artillery line saw any explosions on the craft, we assumed that the rounds missed the target all together.  There was an immediate concern about the rounds because after figuring out the trajectory of the artillery rounds, we saw the point of impact was in the middle of the city of Al-Iskandariyah and the concern for civilian loss of life and collateral damage immediately became priority.  We had an AH-1 Cobra on station and gave the pilot the grid coordinates of where the rounds should have landed so he could identify the point of impact and give us an accurate grid and battle damage assessment.  The pilot flew in a straight line from the cannons in the direction that the rounds were fired.  The pilot came across the radio and reported that there were no impact craters within a 1000 meter radius of the calculated poi! nt of impact and no appearance of any disturbance.

	The next morning we were dispatched to the area we thought the rounds landed to ask around if anyone heard where the rounds landed and no one reported hearing anything at all and the local clinics reported no one being admitted with any shrapnel wounds or no new deaths.  We have no idea what that craft was and even more, we never figured out what happened to the 3 artillery rounds that were fired.  A direct lay shot to a static target 700 meters away should have been an easy direct hit, but there were no traces.","At Time: Soldier.

I took pics because that was part of my job to document the firing activity of our ship, but we were never allowed to keep a private camera (because of what we saw daily with the Russians).  The only pics I had were OKd by the raining head of Naval Security Headquarters at ComSecGruAct West Pacific Station, Yokosuka, Japan.  Wish I had hidden a few rolls, they were something to see.

I attest to this as fact, and to other sightings during various conflict actions during the years 1966 and 1968 in and around the Viet Nam conflict area when I served aboard a U.S. Naval vessel.  When on duty in Plotting I saw numerous blips on my screens that we all knew were not our aircraft and had no idea who?s they were.  I assume some of these blips were our unseen friends who saved our guys.  I know there are other military personnel who can also attest to such happenings during this same period because being Naval Security I heard the stories.  I hope they have the courage to come forward as I just have and risk being humiliation.

Coming home @11:26PM Sunday, May 25, 2014, driving NORTH into Monroe, WA.  Noticed a formation of what looked like red-orange rocket flames with two next to each other parallel to horizon with the third one above the right one of the two below.  

No sounds associated, appeared to be way off in distance.  

Noticed the top one was moving upward, the bottom right one was moving upward after the top one and the left bottom one was then following the second one such that though initially they formed a right angle triangle, they ended up in a straight line following each other. 

I watched as each one went into the clouds, as I could see them get ""fuzzy"" as they entered the clouds and as they approached a thinner portion of the clouds they got less fuzzy but continued to get dimmer due to distance.  

Where would any rockets be coming from that could be seen from my location and since when do rockets get launched in rapid succession?  

Actually, I could more likely believe they would be interceptor missiles or something similar.

At precisely 7:34 pm, I left my home, and began to walk to a nearby convenient store.  The second I turned, and began to walk down the street, (was walking east), I saw a large fire orange colored object, it basically looked like a giant fireball, or a miniature sun, but was slightly off from a perfect sphere.  

I knew immediately it wasn't a plane, a star, or a planet, because of its size and distinct orange hue.  It was about the size of a marble.  I couldn't tell exactly how far away it was, but it appeared to be inside the atmosphere at least, not in space.  It was moving very very slowly, straight down.  

I did manage to capture about a minute and a half of it, but on my cellphone the quality isn't great.  

I thought it might had been a missile of some sort at the time so I was kind of panicked, and since it was moving down, my camera is shaky for some of the footage because I am walking, so I don't lose sight of it.  

The sky wasn't even fully dark at the time so you can tell even in this bad footage that this object shouldn't be there, its just too bright, even on my cellphone camera.  

At the end of the footage you can see it begin to blink, it did this several times before shrinking into a much much smaller, yellow sphere.  

It still followed its path straight down, until it passed the tree and building line, and I lost sight of it. I wish I had better footage, or more information, but...  

That's all I've got.  Oh I also forgot to add the object was dead silent.

Here it is:  Just saw something shoot up in the sky with speeds not currently possible by commercial airliners.  Also it went straight up, like exactly straight up with a little angle, but no turns.  Saw an airplane take-off after it but the lights on the plane seemed so tiny as compared to the thing I saw.  

The thing seemed like a spherical object because a bright yellow light (at least 50x brighter than the airplane) was all that I could see shooting up. Couldn't be a fighter plane coz it's way smaller than a commercial airplane, light wouldn't  be that gigantic.  

Couldn't be a rocket as no material boundaries could be seen.  Couldn't be a missile as well, it's negligible in size as compared to a commercial airplane and its exhaust flame wouldn't be so gigantic as well.

Was on the phone outside when I saw two lights off in the distance in the sky, not blinking like a plane's lights do.  They were flying next to each other so immediately I thought they were military aircraft in a training exercise.  They seemed to be coming toward me, but after second thought I think they were going up.  They started moving away from each other, and then one disappeared, followed by the other disappearing about twenty seconds later.

Then, from the horizon, a similar light went up and disappeared, this time by itself.

Next, two more lights came from the horizon, just like in the first description, and disappeared after parting ways.

The sky was a bit cloudy but not enough to block out stars, etc.  I'm sure it wasn't a commercial aircraft because I saw commercial aircraft flying when I saw the lights.  Very interesting sighting; never seen anything like it before.  I was thinking maybe it was a missile but I've seen those too and they were moving too slowly to be missiles.

I witnessed one craft of a steady red appearance not flashing or pulsating.  Not a dark maroon red or a pale red just a regular inbetween red colour.  I was with my dad and a friend named Duncan when the sighting occured.  I witnessed the craft positioned above a factory named pang at the time of the sighting it was circular in appearance just a solid red glow.  It was disc shaped but slightly rounder than the typical disc you would see on one of those cliche tv programs that's so streamlined.   All I can say from the sighting is that the duration was approximately 15-20 seconds and what I witnessed I wouldn't describe as extra-terrestrial or a man made craft because at the end of the day who knows. all I know is what my eyes witnessed.  What I saw what the craft/disc shaped light I saw hover from a stationery position for about 5-10 seconds above the factory and then accelerate from a standstill to what I can only estimate as to be into the 1000's of mph's instantaneously without a whisper and then the craft disappeared behind cloud cover.  Like a bullet fired from a rifle, the velocity of the craft was astounding.  

My dad still mentions it to people to this day 10-11 years later as if it's a joke and kind of makes me feel uneasy and embaressed by what I'd seen.  If I could only guess at the speed of which I'm no expert I would assume to be 8-10000+ mph silently, instantly.  I live near Lakenheath & Mildenhall airbases's and see the harrier's on a regular basis and know they make a lot of noise when they accelerate.  I would be willing to take a polygraph or any test to prove what I saw be it extra-terrestrial or an experimental government craft, thanks for reading would love to prove what I had truly seen.

Quick background, wife is an X-ray tech, I'm former Air Force that had TS clearance now Project Implementation manager.

Last night my Wife, 14 year old son and I were in the driveway launching fireworks.  We noticed 3 lights in a triangle shape in the distance (few miles away) above the tree line.  At first we thought they were other fireworks that didn't explode because they had an orange color (even though fireworks don't really travel high enough to be seen that far away) But these did not go any higher and stayed in a perfect triangle formation.  We kept waiting for them to disappear or to flash like aircraft but they stayed in the air in the same place.  I believe there were 3 objects because the distance would have made the object massive if it was a single object.  My son tried to photograph and could not. He retrieved my phone and it would not capture the light either because of the distance.  I switched to movie mode and I thought I did not capture anything but once reviewed I was able to capture the triangle formation for a second and have the picture as proof.

After a few minutes the left most light disappeared and the other two went higher in the air and disappeared too.  My years in the Air Force AND life experience up until now have left me without an explanation.  They did not act like 3 aircraft such as helicopters, the only manned vehicle I can think of capable of staying perfect shape without moving for the amount of time.  The were not hot air balloons or flares or anything like that.  I was actually worried it was a missile launch for a minute and couldn't tell they were moving because of perspective. But as time went on they continued to not move.","Project implementation manager",3,3,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2014,2010,3,7,21,"Evening","South",0,1,0,0,0

There is no air base in the region that supports these aircraft certainly not in a east to west manner that they are flying.  There is the westover air force reserve base however it is north of my location and the distance is too soon for the planes to be on a landing approach, these c-130's have been flying lower then normal air traffic approaching the much closer bradley international airport and are on an intersect course with normal air traffic, which i also find to be very odd, as the FFA tends to be anal when military planes due such a thing.","Store Clerk",1,3,"other",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2014,2010,3,7,14,"Afternoon","Northeast",0,1,0,0,0

I got up early one morning it was around 5:56am. Alarm was set for 7am but thought I?d get up and check the weather outside.  It was still dark and the sky was extremely clear, no clouds, and the stars were quite visible.  I decided to go get my camera and take some pictures of the stars since there were so many and visibility was excellent.  I looked up at a group of stars and noticed one of them was moving.  It was a ball of light, silent, and travelling fairly quickly. I thought to myself this is no star or meteorite because of the speed of the object.  I?ve seen meteorites and they fade out pretty fast and travel like a bullet and are gone.  I grabbed my camera and tried to film it with no success. It was pretty high up, maybe 3-5000 feet up.  I watched it for about 90 seconds until it was no longer in sight. Then lo and behold another appeared travelling high up and went by one of those stars that twinkle and appear to change color.  It was also high up (ball of light) and I couldn?t focus for a good picture.  At the same moment in a different area in the sky there was an airplane flying with the typical blinking navigational lights and jet engine sound.  The two were completely different.

Then my attention was drawn to this apparent star that was very bright and changing color. Even to the naked eye I could see it change color. I had my camera on a tripod and started to shoot video and a few pictures. This object whatever it was bluish in color and went from a ball of light to a hexagon with a slight dark spot in the middle. Do stars change colors and shapes?? I don?t know. I thought maybe it was the Earth?s atmosphere and it?s distance from Earth that caused these variations in shape and color. Whatever it was it was fascinating to watch and I videotaped it for about 16 minutes. Unfortunately the balls of light just wouldn?t cooperate with my camera. Here?s an interesting tidbit. I was going through the reports on your site and noticed someone in Surfside Beach, SC reported a red ball of light in the sky on 9/19/14. They said when they zoomed in, it looked like a human brain with shades of gray. Although I couldn?t capture this with my camera, when I used my! binoculars to look at this apparent star, it too looked like a brain in the sky. It was really cool looking and when I went out of focus with the binoculars is when it looked like a wired brain in the sky. I thought maybe I was seeing things. Now I know someone else saw a ball of light when zooming in taking on the appearance of a brain. I think I will coin the term UFB,meaning ""unidentified flying brain?. Of course I?m poking a little fun at this but this story is absolutely true. I think many people see odd things in our skies but never take the time to ponder something really different just happened. If I can I will post the picture of this pulsating star and video on your site.","Help Desk Agent",1,2,"light",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2014,2010,3,9,6,"Morning","South",0,1,0,0,0

At approximately 8pm on the night of Wednesday, October 15, 2014, my wife and I noticed the fastest flying object either of us have ever seen in the sky above Salinas, Ca.  We were on N. Main Street in our car facing South in moderate traffic when we noticed a bright constant white light in the sky above the valley traveling right to left, or West to South East, at an extremely fast speed that instantly grabbed our attention.  It had no blinking lights as would normally be present on an aircraft and it was traveling so far that we immediately concluded that it wasn't a plane or jet.  It maintained a horizontal trajectory, never falling the way a shooting star would.  We watched it for approximately 20 seconds before we lost view of it in the distance, still glowing bright white as it traveled down the valley towards Soledad.

 There were clouds in the sky, and while we saw common airplanes in the sky immediately after, moving slowly in comparison and receding occasionally behind a cloud, we both noted that the UFO never receded behind any clouds during our brief observation.  This indicates that it flew below the cloud line low enough in the Salinas Valley to rule out a satellite or missile.

 We have an annual air show here and we both grew up watching jets race over the valley one weekend out of every year.  We both agree what we saw was by far much much faster than any jet we've ever witnessed.

I've been having dreams again and this is the most intense experience ever.  This may be a memory of an abduction (time and date unknown).  At first, they were a little disturbing, but now I believe that this may be a memory of event.

I awoke, naked in a copper colored translucence room with rounded corners and indirect lighting.  A feminine (machine) voice spoke to me, answering my questions.  There was a rhythmic machine noise (or hum) in the distance and vibrations could be felt in the floor and walls of the craft.

I believe the craft was quite large and that a form of artificial gravity was being used.  When I dropped objects they seemed to fall into their own footprint, not off center as would happen with centrifugal force generated gravity.

The craft was large (I could only gauge its size from the rooms that I was allowed to traverse; hallways, hangars, corridors).  Perhaps as large as an American aircraft carrier. It appears to have been built for a humanoid form and the Air and climate was earth normal.

All my communication was with the ""voice"" whom I knick-named ""Mother.""  It wasn't unpleasant.

Recently the dreams have become more frequent and detailed.  I am retired Military and spent time at White Sands Missile Range where I witnessed a lot of UFO activity in the 1980's.

Event one:  	At 19:55 I witnessed a orange light appear from behind the San Gabriel  Mountains.  The mountain range is from west to east. I am about 10 miles from the peaks.

At approx 7:50pm on 12/20/2014, I walked outside and noticed something that looked like a sort of amythest-colored, purple-pinkish light in the sky.  It was completely odd and caught my attention right away.  It actually looked like 2 lights side-by-side, horizontal to the ground,  very close together or possibly even attached.  Brighter than a star.. well, brighter than Sirius (which appears in the Eastern sky this time of year)  I started watching it, completely perplexed by the color.  My first thought was that it might be someone playing with a drone, but it wasn't like any drone I've ever seen (I've seen a few in my life.. my neighbor even has a large one).  The light was steady and brilliant, not flashing.  It didn't have the typical red/green, flashing lights that you would expect from an R/C toy or airplane.  It wasn't a satellite either.  I'm former military (Navy Electronic Warfare) and I can assure you that I've never seen anything in the sky with the same color light.  In fact, the sky was totally overcast that night, but below the clouds it was very clear and there was good visibility.  No stars were visible, nor could I see any of the usual air traffic heading into the Bay Area because of the cloud layer.

 When I spotted the object, it looked like it was maybe 200-300 yards to the East at less than 500 ft in altitude... essentially over my neighborhood.  At first it looked stationary, like it was hovering.  Then it started to slowly move East (away from me).  I noticed that I couldn't hear any 'drone' sounds.. nor any other sounds from planes, etc.  As I watched, it seemed to speed up a little, the all of the sudden took a 90-degree left turn (at speed) and moved a short distance before abruptly stopping.  I would estimate it moved maybe 200 yds in less than one second.  I literally said  ?#@!*%$&!*? out loud to myself!!   That's when I realized I had my phone in my left hand... duh!!  I immediately launched the camera and started to record some video.  It's not great video...  the object looks really tiny, almost invisible on my Samsung s5, but you can certainly see it when playing back on a laptop, or something with a bigger screen.  It looks like a white star moving away fr! om me and unfortunately, you can't see the purple-ish color, it just looks like a white dot.  By the time I got the video going it had started to move Eastward again, slowly almost wavering a bit before moving behind the trees across the street from my house and out of my view.

 Several minutes later I was still outside trying to play back the video and one of the typical airliners that I usually see flew overhead.. I couldn't actually see it because of the cloud cover, but I could definitely hear it.  So, whatever I saw and recorded that night was flying below the clouds and not making any noise.  It wasn't a plane or any other celestial object, not a drone, missile, meteor, etc.... I'm somewhat of a trained observer...  I have a military background and also have a couple pilots in my immediate family.

 Unfortunately, the video is only a few seconds long.  At one point I tried to zoom, but it went out of view, then I un-zoomed and found it again.    I'd be happy to share a link to my Google drive if your interested in seeing it.  Otherwise, I don't really want to post it online anywhere.

Hi. my name is ((name deleted)).  I was on my way to cash my check at the regular check cashing spot I usually go to.  On my way there I stop at the crossing light and saw to my left across the street what I thought at first was a jet taking off, as I'm near several airports and a few military bases.

I kept an eye on this object that resembled a jet or missile going into the sky at a 90? angle.  As it kept going up, it disappeared and then after 5 seconds or so it reappeared, but the funny thing is that it slowed down to a total stop and was now much bigger.  It resembled a pill or a cylinder shape.  It stayed there for about 6 to 8 minutes.  At this time I was getting ready to cross the street and looked away for one second and when I looked back up it was gone.  Except I saw the tail of smoke it left.

Now two minutes later a helicopter appeared going in the direction in which the object was just at. I watched this helicopter circle around for at least five or ten minutes and then it left.  I couldn't believe this was happening. I wish my camera/video recorder was working but it wasn't.

The other funny thing is that I seem to be the only person interested in looking at this object.  This hasn't been the first time I've seen something strange and it won't be the last. T

This is the second of two consecutive reports about my sightings of December 11, 2013 and June 13, 2014, at age 73 and 74, respectively.  I observed my first and only two UFOs ever.  

Both of these sightings occurred within a 6-month period from the same general location.  Since these objects appeared to be about the same size and shape, I have the impression that both sightings might have been of the same craft; however, I have no other proof of this assumption.  These are given in chronological order, and the first sighting in 2013 was vague, distant and impersonal ? I did not file a report on it then, nor even mention it to anyone, including my wife.  By contrast, the second encounter in 2014 was a life-changing event ? it was shocking to be shown that we humans are not the only intelligent beings here.

My second, very much unexpected and extremely more vivid sighting occurred six months later at 11:00 pm on Friday night, June 13, 2014, near Hexter Elementary School.  I had walked to Gold?s Gym at Northcliff & Buckner at 9:30 pm and had left at 10:50 pm.  It was a beautiful night, comfortably warm, the sky was clear with a full moon and no wind, and there was not the usual city noise.  Nobody else was seen outside and there was no automobile traffic in the neighborhood.  I was walking alone in the middle of the street in the full moonlight.

As I was traveling roundabout back to my house, a lighted craft suddenly appeared high over me at Northlake near Peavy.  I was rounding a curve heading generally northward and the lights cleared above the 30-foot trees to my right, or east side.  This occurred within the usual flight path of airplanes originating from south Texas and landing at Love Field; however, at this time most scheduled Southwest Airline flights had finished for the night ? which seemed to be a very important factor in the presence of this thing.  

Before 10:00 pm, mostly 737s and some corporate jets fly over here at about 8,000-feet or 1.5-mile altitude, heading north to cross I-635 where they will make a left, west to south U-turn and land at Love Field.  Now, there were not any planes in the sky anywhere.  Subconsciously, I assumed the lights were an airplane, but the object actually stopped directly above me as I was walking alone in the middle of the street.  

I instantly looked up and felt that it had be! en watching me on the roadway in the full moonlight ? I was the only rabbit alone on the road.  The craft appeared to be positioned almost 1-mile straight up ? maybe 1 or 2-degrees eastward ? with the apparent size of a large corporate jet; it seemed to be slightly smaller than a 737.  Although it is difficult to estimate size and height at night, I am reasonably sure that it was not over 1-mile, nor under 1/2-mile. (I have since studied airplanes flying directly overhead to confirm this perceived altitude and size.) -See illustration of UFO provided - It had extremely bright lights of pure colors, the brightest I have ever seen and the most beautiful red and green. There was no softness to the lights, only a sharp piercing glare.  

The object had a strange jerky aspect unlike any aircraft.  No Federal Aviation Administration navigation lights were apparent ? specifically, green on the starboard, red on the port, flashing strobes on the wingtips, with fore and aft white lights as required below 10,000 feet altitude.  Its lights were arranged in a nonsensical pattern as in my diagram above, with the red lights blinking on and off every 2-seconds ? this appeared to be the front, as the craft moved.  All of the red lights pulsed together; there was no 1-2-3 sequence.  The green lights shined steady, did not blink and appeared to be the sides.  

Each red and green row was composed of about 10 individual pinpoint lights, all like bulbs with equal intensity. No other lights, colors or emanations could be seen.  My sketch diagrams the bel! ly of the craft as seen from below.  The body was not visible as a silhouette against the sky because of the bright lights; however, I am certain that there was a rigid structure because the lights maintained their relative position at all times.  If I were to guess, I would say the object was rather triangular because of the arrangement of the lights, but I cannot be sure of this.  It had a clear-cut, garish carnival midway appearance ? there was no vagueness at all.  My initial and vivid impression was as if a Texas State Fairground contraption, such as a Ferris wheel, with its colorful, blinking lights, had been placed 1-mile overhead in the night sky to float around ?  it was totally out of place and illogical.  I instantly realized that this was not an airplane, so I quickly stepped under a front yard tree to my right or east side on Northlake, to hide from its view.  My actions were largely reflexive and fear-responsive, so I probably was only visible to the craft for a few! seconds.

Immediately after I hid, the object seemed to have lost me, because it began to go back and forth, do figure-8s, hover and rock as I watched from between the leaves. Imagine that you are standing on the bottom of a lake watching the bottom of a big motorboat circling above you on the surface; similarly, seen by me from below, the circling craft acted as though it was floating on a flat horizontal surface.  The effect was like looking up at the bottom of a large launch that was being driven around on a choppy lake surface; perhaps the medium or force upon which the craft rode ? or it created ? was wavy.  The craft stayed contained within an imaginary circle of about 1/4-mile diameter eastward of me as it apparently searched; it never strayed to the west side of me.  Of course, its actions were faster than a motorboat as it maneuvered around searching the bottom below.  When it stopped, it seemed to rock like a boat, as though floating on waves.  The craft appeared to be driven or controlled by a coxswain who was methodically searching the bottom below, making its movements selective, erratic and chaotic as it went back and forth, repeatedly, stopping and going.

The object emitted a very faint but perceptible whirring sound from high up, similar to an electric motor brush.  This sound had that same distant overhead audio quality as some hot air balloons, ultra-lights and blimps that I have heard from the ground while they were high above me; I have heard voices, burners and motors from these.  With this UFO, I had both eyed and eared confirmation of an actual materially structured mechanical craft and of its apparent vertical distance above.  Furthermore, the tone or pitch of the electrical motor sound seemed to change throughout its movements overhead, as though accommodating various mechanical requirements.

Throughout all of this, I was busily playing devil?s advocate ? ?Could this be an electrically powered human-fabricated aircraft??  Suddenly, I realized that if whatever was controlling this thing had infrared vision that I had better get behind the wooden tree limbs, which I promptly did.  For whatever reason, the object appeared to be searching for ground-based subject matter, so I remained cowing against the tree trunk and became a certified tree-hugger.  To add to my problems, the front yard?s motion detector light turned on.

This weirdness went on for the longest three minutes, my anxiety level was rising and I began to wonder how it would all play out.  Suddenly, without any warning, the object instantly streaked nose-first at a downward angle, around 45-degrees, east-northeast toward the Lochwood Park area. It went from hovering almost directly overhead, down to the horizon, traveling over a 1-mile distance, at one constant and terrific speed. There was no observable acceleration against inertia or deceleration against momentum. I have watched high-performance jets stall out several miles above and then rev up to flight speed ? this takes several seconds. My UFO did this instantly! When its lights disappeared through the trees and just above the horizon, it was still travelling at the same speed without slowing down. Its observed lack of inertia and momentum implied that the object had no mass, as though it were only a mirage or light image, and it actually looked somewhat that way during the d! ive.

Although I could only see the lights, the craft appeared to be intermittent between a real object such as a bus or airplane, and an artificial movie-projected image of such. That is, at times, it would have passed for a solid material night-flying helicopter; while at other times, the lights seemed transparent and unreal, like projections on a movie screen. The greatest division in this dichotomy appeared between the very separate hovering and diving phases. During the overhead circling, I felt as though I could rap my knuckles on the craft; conversely, during the dive, I felt as though my arm might go through it. This division was reinforced by the whirring mechanical sound of the craft as it hovered, contrasted by the total silence when it dived at supersonic speed. Lending to this impression, a solid form would have created friction, pushed the air aside and made a horrific noise; this thing made no sound whatsoever. There was no noise at all during the dive ? any air-dis! placement whoosh, sonic boom, crash or explosion ? anything! Artillery shells make a distinctive sound as they pass through the air, and this speeding UFO should have done likewise. Incredibly, there appeared to be no resistance from the air. I felt that if I had shot this thing with a rifle, the bullet would have gone through it. Because of the lack of both inertia and air resistance, I must assume that there was no solid object ? AS WE KNOW IT ? during the dive phase. This raises my question of whether the UFO was somehow outside of our physical reality, a consideration that might apply to the origin of these things. I assume that a craft from another solar planet or star system would obey the same Newtonian physical laws that we do ? but this thing did not do this.

- See diagram of flight path provided - Visualize a right triangle with me on the ground at the 90-degree angle, and the craft 1-mile above me, searching within a 1/4-mile diameter circle to the east.  The full Moon is southeast, at about 50-degrees elevation at 11:00-pm CDT, at its lowest zenith in June ? exactly opposite the Sun. The UFO dove toward the east-northeast at about a 45-degree angle. I have fine-tuned the compass direction with several visits; however, because it dived away from me, the exact descent angle cannot be exact.  Therefore, I have bracketed or averaged it as 45-degrees, and the ?landing point? would be approximately 1-mile away horizontally at the other 45-degree angle.  On the map, that would be around the Lochwood Park area.  Draw a line from Northlake-Peavy east-northeast across Lochwood Park and somewhere along this track is where the UFO ?landed.?  By geometry, the flight path or hypotenuse would be about 1 1/4-mile long ? or a little over 1-mile when discounting the 10-degree roofline.  The object?s closest proximity to me would be about 7/10-mile as it slid down the hypotenuse.  I watched its lights through the trees until the craft was about to slam into the ground about 1/10-mile above the actual horizon.  Seeing the UFO dive to the horizon greatly helped me to scale and confirm my original vertical estimate as about 1-mile altitude, and no lower than 1/2-mile.

I have used three methods to determine and confirm the exit speed as about Mach-1.  First, my daughter and I have attended the Fort Worth Alliance air show annually for over twenty years ? a father-daughter thing.  There are always jet interceptor fly-bys, usually by an F-18 Super Hornet, at Mach-1, whereby the sound shock wave is visible forming off the fuselage.  The June 13 UFO simply appeared to be diving that fast and that is what I settled on. Second, it took no more than 5-seconds for the craft to go from 1-mile overhead, then 45-degrees downward to the horizon, a dive distance of over 1-mile.  Here, I estimated the dive time, based upon my gut feel of 5-seconds.  Third, at home I pointed my finger at an imaginary UFO and had my daughter time my downward sweep with a watch, always getting about 5-seconds.  In summary, 1-mile multiplied times 5-seconds works out to 720-mph, or about Mach-1.

At the short end of the spectrum, time is easy to estimate. Two, five and ten-seconds can be accurately guessed.  As time gets longer, estimating becomes more inaccurate ? one minute is more difficult and an hour is even more so.  Five-seconds were easy to guess and to confirm by dragging my hand downward and having someone else clocks me.  My object had lights that pulsed every two seconds and it dove within about five seconds ? these times were simple to bracket and measure.  I estimated that the craft hovered above me for 3-minutes because it seemed like 3-minutes, even when considering the lengthened anxiety factor.  In addition, I bracketed the hovering phase ? it was certainly longer than 1-minute and probably shorter than 5-minutes ? thus, 3-minutes.  My calculations of distance, time and speed all conform to one another mathematically ? its red lights blinked every two seconds, the object hovered about 1-mile above for 3-minutes and exited at a 45-degree downward angle, di! ving within about 5-seconds at a speed of around 720-mph.

As the craft streaked downward toward the horizon, its lights were visible through the nearby trees, but of course, the lights were blocked when they went behind the roofline.  The angle of total disappearance was about 5 or 10-degrees above the actual horizon, which would have been about 1/10-mile above the ground at the ?point of impact.?  Seeing the object go through the far tree line greatly reinforced my vertical estimate as 1-mile distance.  The UFO?s path of descent formed an imaginary ?hypotenuse of a right triangle,? which is depicted in the third diagram.  At the horizontal, its size and distance could be compared to foreground features ? much as a rising full moon can be compared to nearby hills, trees, houses and so forth ? this confirmed my estimation of the overall scale of the UFO flight path.

The contrast between the 3-minute hovering and the 5-second dive was astounding, and suggested that there were two methods of control during these two phases ? manual and autopilot.  This dichotomy erased all doubt as to whether or not this was a human construction.  The circling and wobbling object appeared to be silly, jerky, and almost Warner Brothers cartoonish with the super bright garish lights ? the reds pulsing on and off, and the greens glowing steadily.  The searching was asymmetrical, irregular and chaotic ? as though a coxswain was steering the boat randomly and impulsively as he searched the ground far below.  If I had witnessed only the hovering phase, I would not be convinced that it was not some type of human-made aircraft.

By contrast, had I seen only the 5-second dive, I would not be convinced that it was not some reentering satellite debris.  This exit plunge was straight, steady, mechanical, meteor-like and almost blurred.  Unlike in its erratic circling phase, the fast diving craft did not appear to be arbitrarily piloted, but went down uniformly at a constant speed in a straight line from A to B as though programmed and automatic.  It appeared as if a switch was flipped, which said, ?Take me from here to there.?  Certainly, no human pilot would have had nerve reflexes fast enough to control this suicide dash downward and I assume the same for any biological organism.  As it dove, the form or basic structure of the object was perfectly retained ? the blinking red bar of lights in front and the two steady green rows of lights on the sides. However, more so than when it was circling, the craft looked strangely like an artificial light image as it dashed downward, with the pulsing red lights at th! e front. Possibly, the angle of the lights were turned away from me somewhat, making them appear dimmer, thus contributing to the dichotomy of appearance. The object went down angled into the dive and all of its light structure was retained intact, as though it being a rigid object. However, both of these phases, when put together said that this was not grandma?s biscuits. I looked straight at this thing for 3-minutes as it hovered, and for 5-seconds as it dove ? it definitely was NOT a human-made aircraft! A saying goes that we should always look for ponies before we look for unicorns. In the best tradition of looking for ponies, immediately following the sighting I attempted to eliminate all plausible possibilities. I considered a DRONE as an explanation, and several other folks, including my wife, have since offered the drone scenario (which seems to be the contemporary Debunker explanation for all UFOs today). This would certainly fit the hovering and whirring electric motor sound, since several drone models are electric powered hovering devices. Immediately after this event, I asked myself, ?Did someone launch and retrieve a drone from the Lochwood Mall parking lot?? However, I quickly dismissed my devil?s advocacy here because this explanation would have been more unrealistic than a ?flying saucer.? The large size, mile altitude, glaring lights and exit speed ruled against a drone. Hobbyist?s electric RC craft are small, weak and slow, and they fly at very low altitudes. ! Military drones are larger and more powerful, but still rather slow. These are secretive, conserve power to remain on patrol for long periods, and they do not waste batteries on bright lighting; the CIA is not going to advertise its presence with glaring, blinking lights. All of this goes against the large corporate jet-size of my UFO, which was hovering 1-mile up with lights blazing while milling back and forth.

Consider the Mach-1 exit speed. No drone, civilian or military, is streamlined or powerful; indeed, such a design would be antithetical to the hovering purpose of a drone. All drones have propellers or rotors. No propeller driven airplane has ever achieved Mach speed and survived ? ever!  This formidable velocity requires an aerodynamic, reinforced coke bottle-shaped fuselage, sweptback razor thin wings, and a turbojet engine with a powerful afterburner.  Even the fabled F-86 Saber Jet and MiG 15 of Korean War vintage could not reach the speed of sound.  Moreover, no human-constructed aircraft ? prop or jet ? would have pulled out of such a steep dive at that speed.

Finally, yet importantly, all aircraft, civilian and military, CIA or FBI, drone or whatever, flying high in United States commercial airspace are required by law to conform to FAA lighting standards.  This is to prevent mid-air collisions with other planes.  As ruled by the National Transportation Safety Board, an ?aircraft? is any device used for flight in the air ? there are no exceptions!  My observed object was violating a main landing flight path over northeast Dallas, which would have been filled with vulnerable commercial Love Field traffic an hour earlier.  It was shining and blinking bright garish lights that were arranged in the bizarre pattern illustrated above, that made no sense and which conformed to no codes or regulations.  If it were any human-made object, it would have been flying illegally and in violation of United States law.

My UFO had a definite symmetrical structure, differential lighting, a variable mechanical sound, a 3-minute time of operation and a complex behavior, so it was not a natural phenomenon such as a mirage, ball lightning, plasma, Venus, meteor, swamp gas and so forth. It moved back and forth against the wind, so it was not a passive lighter-than-air object such as a balloon, kite or Chinese lantern. During its high-speed dive, the UFO exhibited no inertia or momentum, and it made no sound; therefore, it was not a human-made aircraft ? no human construct can do this. All of this taken together leaves only a NOT human solution.

Of interest, the June 13 object appeared to be predatory by its raptor-like tactics. First, there was the sneaking up and hovering above me. Second, after I hid under a tree whereby it lost me, the craft started to circle as though scanning the ground for a replacement. Third, it seemed to have spotted another ground-based subject, toward which it made a dive. (Of course, we want to believe this target was an abductee ? whether true or not.) The entire affair was reminiscent of a hawk circling in the sky and stooping at a mouse in a field. I suspect, but will never know, that my quick reflexive hiding may have saved me from being confronted by whatever was operating this thing. It was never closer than 7/10-mile during the 5-second diving. Other than the expected natural anxiety and elevated adrenaline, I have never experienced any unusual symptoms then or afterwards. I actually arrived home earlier than planned because I did not proceed with my exercise walkabout, thus had ! no ?missing time.? Several months later, I have not experienced any side effects, so I guess that I am in the clear? The weirdly blinking red and the stationary green lights made no sense; were they designed for them or for us? I have reviewed many other UFO reports and have never seen any pattern described like mine; therefore, I assume it was either a custom job or the object could configure its own lighting scheme.  All that I can surmise is that the garish, colorful lights might have been an enticement or gimmick to instill interest and attract a sucker to stand still and gawk. I know that I certainly was enticed to observe this thing; only my fear of the unknown overrode my curiosity and kept me from standing in the open street and observing it.  This entire affair became a delicate balance between me hiding from the craft and me peeking at it.

Of note, the UFO did not execute whatever action it desired, against whatever ground-based target it apparently had ? from high up during its hovering position.  There were no visible projectiles, rays or whatever extending downward from the object toward any ground subject; conversely, there was nothing from the ground, which came upward to the craft.  Apparently, the object had to dive physically from its mile-high perch down to whatever it had targeted at ground level.  It appeared to have needed to get near whatever its interest was to accomplish whatever it wanted to do.  This would be like a hawk needing to get down grasping a mouse with its talons.  I estimate that the UFO ?landed? somewhere along a straight path, east-northeast from Northlake-Peavy, with Lochwood Park as the central impact.  It was traveling at a constant Mach-1 velocity as it approached about 1/10-mile above the ground.  I did not see it again as I walked home after that, so the object either stopped instantly or else it drilled into the ground.  Afterwards, there was no explosion, no news report and no evidence of damage.

Two days after my June 13 observation, I wrote a short letter to the Dallas Morning News in hopes that other witnesses, perhaps near Lochwood Park, had seen where the object went and what it did after plunging below the tree line.  My letter was not published, which suggests that when these things are reported to the mainstream news media, they are laughed off.   Circuitously, since no one hears about them, there is nothing to them!  During my lifetime of 74-years, I have never seen anything that I could not explain; I can even explain my two Unidentified Flying Objects and thus make them Identified Flying Objects ? they simply are highly advanced machines, designed, built and operated in our atmosphere by intelligent creatures that are NOT human.  What these beings are or where they are from, I can only speculate; however, their existence and activity in our environment is a 100-percent fact, from my direct observations.  This reality should help support those claims by other witnesses of fantastic and bizarre UFO occupant activity, as being a very real physical possibility.

All of the testimony given here is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

	I was driving southbound on Highway 101 in Carlsbad, CA. at approximately 9:25 pm, the air was clear and I can see the lights off int the distance of Point Loma near San Diego clearly.  A red glowing object flew directly over my car.  I thought that it was a meteorite because of the brightness and the way that it seemed to blur as it moved across the sky flying directly southbound along highway 101.  I was driving at a speed of 50 miles per hour and I assumed that it would burn out seconds after I saw it, but it did not, it continued on, in a straight trajectory, not losing any altitude.

	The next thought that I had was that it was going as fast as a missile and, living in Oceanside, Ca near Camp Pendleton, it may have come from there.  My confusion turned to concern, knowing that it had no other flashing lights like the jets that land at Carlsbad Airport or the commercial jets that fly southbound along the coast over the ocean.  The only other aircrafts that fly along the coast above the land are the police helicopters that fly over head at times, but mostly over the water.

	I continued following it down the coast, rarely taking my eyes off of it so as to keep my car on the road.  The light was very bright at first, like a meteorite, bigger that Venus when you can see it on a clear night and it?s closest to the earth.  

I had kept my eyes on it for about 2 minutes when I saw that it had seemed to be flying over the Sea World tower, approximately 30 miles away.  I had reached Leucadia, Ca, and couldn?t see past the cliffs at this point, but at my last view it had traveled far enough so the light was just a speck in the distance.

	In my approximations, the light was about 1000 feet from the ground and traveling at a speed faster than the F15s from Miramar Air Force Base. 30 miles in 2 minutes would equal about 900 miles per hour.","Surf Retail/Repair employee",1,1,"fireball",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2015,2010,1,1,17,"Afternoon","West",0,1,0,0,0

About 15:33 local time, saw an object far in the distance, ascending from the horizon at what appeared to be a very steep angle and leaving a smoke/vapor trail (reminded me of a rocket or missile launch).  Thought it looked a little unusual, until I observed it make a very sharp, practically right angle turn.  Looked to be travelling at a high rate of speed and not manoeuvering like a commercial aircraft.

Object continued moving somewhat level until appearing to enter  another, more gentle turn while still climbing steeply (trail was more of an arc than another right angle).  Object was actually turning closer to me.  As it started to get closer, it became even more apparent that it was travelling extremely fast.

The really curious part came as the aircraft travelled directly overhead.  It looked to be very high up, flying above the wispy cloud cover, and as it flew over, coincidentally, there was a commercial airliner passing underneath it.  Based on those observations, it looked to be too big to be a fighter.  As well, its shape (and coloring) did not really match any aircraft I am familiar with.  More flying wedge than plane with wings.  It looked more SpaceX than F-22 or F-35 (or any other active/inactive US military aircraft).  Most assuredly man made, but very unusual all the same.




((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS))

Hi,

Here are a few images I took of the event in question.  I Wish now I had taken a video, but this is not the sort of thing I see every day and was wanting to watch it with my own eyes as much as possible. The blue area on the map picture shows the general line of sight where I was looking when first observing the craft (S/SE).  My vantage point is the dot at the apex of the traingular area.

Again, I really wish I had recored a video, but would probably not have gotten anything usable as it passed overhead anyways due to the awkward angle of trying to blindly aim a camera almost straight up and out my window as it flew over.  I'm sure overall, this is a pretty pedestrain report (and not really alien), but some of he crafts movements didn't seem quite 'right', and it's shape was certainly unique.

((END ADDENDUM))

((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS))

Hey again,

One thing I forgot to mention anywhere that is worth noting is the sound the craft made, which was none.  From the time I started watching it climb, until it came directly overhead, I didn't hear any sort of noise.  Also, I forgot to check the 'contact me' checkbox on the report.  If you need to contact me further with any other questions, feel free.

Saturday, July 25th, 1964, at 12:00 Noon, How can I ever forget this day.  It was a beautiful calm day.  Being I just shortly got my Driving permit at age 15, My Father told me to use the Family Car a 1956 Pontiac to drive home a employee of his.  He lived Below the Hill in Roscoe, Minnesota, 56371.  Just minutes away from his Business.  I drove, with passenger Dads car, North from Roscoe about a mile for a joy ride first.  This town is build on a wash out with a hill on both sides about a mile apart.  This will brings you at a creek that runs under the road.  The conversation was we were talking About being on our High School Base ball Team when School Starts in September,  That's when I saw the silver disk.  It was so visible and close against the blue sky.  

I started yelling at the passenger. Look at that Silver Saucer!!  I then braked hard and pulled the car to the side of the road near the creek and parked.  I kept the engine running and shifted in neutral.  We both observed a Disk/ Saucer to the North of where we were parked about a half mile away.  We observed the Silver Saucer/Disk at first hovering about 250 Feet Above a farm to the N.W.  It made no sound, No lights or windows could be seen.  It then moved to the next farm a half mile away to the east and Hovering over it for about a minute.  It then crossed the road to the East, really got a good look at it being so close.  It hovered over a pasture.  Each time it stopped it Wobbling like it was having a hard time controlling it self.  It then moved over the pasture area slowly, stopped and Hovered and then started an upward diagonal assent.  The acceleration then speeded up to and incredible 3 second to the cloud level and Vanished.   We were terrified at the speed not knowing what this was, where it went and if it was coming back to flank us.  I turned the car around south and headed back to Roscoe as fast as dads 389 Pontiac car would go.  I drove back to his Business both of us running in telling what we just experienced.  Dad and several customers then armed themselves, went out side and saw nothing.  Several other sighting were reported that month in that county and area.  Later that fall 1964, a U.S Air force Radar team was dispatched to Regal, Minnesota Just 18 Miles Away.  The Radar team was set up with 4 railroad Cars with Radar Equipment and living Quarters.  Some of these Air force personal during their off duty time would patronize my dad's night club business on Saturday night with their Air Force uniforms on.  I had to work those nights.  Seeing the uniform, I ask what their were up to in Regal, Minnesota.  They responded it was Top Secret.  After 6 months or so I got to Know one of the Air force personal Quite well as their deployment was coming to an end.  He told me that the reason they were dispatched was because of all the UFO sighting seen on radar in our area.  He said, the mission was that an Early warning detection system was deployed if the soviet Union launched a missile, that's what they told the Paynesville press but we were looking for UFO's mostly because this is a hot spot he stated.  I told him what I saw on July 25, 1964, and he said, that why were are here, so many sightings were reported.","Retired",2,1,"disk",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1964,1960,3,7,13,"Afternoon","Midwest",0,1,0,0,0

This event happened in the mid 1960s when I was watching early evening television with my parents and sisters.  It would have been around 7 P.M., or so, when a news bulletin came on.  Those were the days when they would cut into the scheduled programming live on air and verbally announce the bulletin while flashing the news bulletin screen.  

I still remember the words almost verbatim; ?The Hancock Field Control Tower reports a large UFO traveling east over Central New York.?  

My father immediately went outside to look, but was not able to see anything.

Hancock Field is the international airport located in Syracuse, New York.  My home at the time of the event was approximately sixteen miles east of the airport.  By happenchance some years later I acquired a paperback edition of Project Blue Book which contained black & white UFO photographs.  One of those photos was listed as ?Syracuse, NY, 1966.?  

I?m pretty confident this photo depicted the UFO that was the subject of the news bulletin.

((ADDENDUM FROM MR. TED MOLCZAN, OF SEESAT-L))

Hello Peter,

The fuel dump from the Centaur stage of last night's Atlas V launch, was widely visible to the unaided eye from N. America. It began on Mar 13 at about 04:15 UTC, and was visible for about an hour.

Ed Cannon, a long-time member of SeeSat-L, described his sighting as follows:

http://satobs.org/seesat/Mar-2015/0143.html

The Centaur was on a high-elevation pass, that moved west to east across the southern sky. It climbed in altitude from about 2,500 km to more than 20,000 km, on its way to its apogee of about 70,000 km.

Best regards,
Ted Molczan

On 04 April, 2015, at approximately 2100 hours, (9:00 PM), in Essex Maryland over looking the Chesapeake Bay, near Heart and Millers Island and viewing the night sky, the following was observed.  A very bright white circular light was observed traveling from the south to the north.  The object was at a great altitude, unknown as to the altitude level.  The object would resemble the likeness of the planet Venus, showing very brightly in the sky as an example to the size and shape, but much brighter.  I would estimate this object to have been traveling approximately 10,000 mph at least.  It covered the entire length of the sky in about 15 to 20 seconds.  This was not a meteor, as there was no tail etc.  This object covered the sky at an enormous rate of speed.

My understanding is that this government test blimp, records and monitors any and all aircraft, missiles etc, and anything in the air over the entire east coast.

On Friday April 17, 2015-today in fact, at first I saw an object that looked like a bird flying up in the air not too far from a jet, which I assume was on a flight path for a landing at either JFK or LaGuardia airport nearby.

It was 5:55 pm, sunny, and most people in suburbia here on Long Island were on their way home from work.

What caught my attention first was the fact that the object was up so high.

And the next fact was that although it appeared bird like, it was traveling at a high rate of speed. It looked white at first then silver.

In fact, it was going faster than the jet!  It had descended and as I watched (with my prescription sunglasses on), from my car in a parking field, the object went from a northeasterly direction on my right towards the west on my left.

I grabbed for my phone to take a photo but decided to keep watching instead-the object became an orb joining another orb that spun around it.  The two continued on then met up with another 3 or 4 orbs encircling them before ascending and disappearing! This was near Roosevelt Field, Long Island, NY.  A Marines base is nearby.

Is this military? Does the FAA know about this, I'm a former newspaper reporter and editor.","Former editor",1,6,"changing",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2015,2010,2,4,17,"Afternoon","Northeast",0,1,0,0,0

The boat was doing work ups getting ready for deployment, we had a full deployment crew.

Me and a couple of other ET's heard some of the watch standers on the island talking about seeing something crazy, they said something about trying lock on to it with the Nato Sea Sparrow Director's onto the object.  Me and a handful of guys on the night shift ran up to the O-10 where the watch standers were watching it.  They had the mounted Binoculars trained on the object.  I thought they were mistaking two stars one of which looked like a pulsar (due to my pretty extensive knowledge of astronomy).  The object then appeared between the two stars again, the other guys saw the object as well.  We all thought we might be imagining it, asked each other a couple of times if they saw it too.  We all agreed that it was there.

When I first noticed it, I thought I was imagining it.  How could a star disappear then reappear right in front of me?  I watched it through the mounted binoculars changing colors between blue, white, purple, and pink at high speed, it kept pulsing.

It seemed to stay motionless, the problem was that the altitude was just high for any of us to make out exactly what it looked like, from our vantage point we could see that it may have been hovering and possibly moving but just can't say for sure.  

After about 5 minutes of viewing the object as we were all trying to get a look at it, a bright flash filled the sky in the location of the object, it looked like it shot with an incredible speed and was gone.  We were traveling North, the object was northeast of our Northerly heading.  Our speed was approximately 15 to 20 knots.

The three watch standers at there post reported that two similar objects had come out of the main relatively stationary object and then rejoined the main object.

During my time watching the object CIC (Combat Information Center) was trying to get a radar lock on the object with the Nato Sea Sparrow Missile Directors.  The directors (which are radar directors, fire control radar) kept trying to lock onto the object then it would drop back down to the horizon, the OS's (Operation Specialists) trying to drive the director back there again.  Every time they would drive to get a lock the lock would fail and the director would be driven back down again.  It seemed to me that the object was overriding the directors drive control or that the radar receiver was being over powered and being forced by internal programming to protect its receiver, (to get away from the source of the electromagnetic radiation) it could have been over-driven by the object being to close but more than likely the object was jamming the radar.  I can't say weather it was jamming the object passively or actively, just that the radar was being jammed.

After the sighting I checked the SPN-43 and SPS-49 radar in CATCC, neither of them had a radar return, although at that altitude the chances of a radar return are very slim.

I tried to report it to my chain of command, they laughed at me and said that we didn't see anything.  We probably just excited, I didn't expect that reaction especially when CIC reacted the way they did.","Active Navy",10,3,"circle",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2014,2010,3,8,2,"Night","South",0,1,0,0,0

One object was ahead of the other one and slowly making distance, when out of no where the one trailing behind sped up quicker than a bullet and caught up to the one ahead.  Then they started traveling at the same speed til out of distance.  They were close enough to ground where there would of been sound if they were aircraft, yet there was absolutely no sound. Complete silence.

I know for a fact that my phone had full battery, but as soon as I pulled out my phone to record the objects my phone died and I couldn't.  Objects seemed to cause a small type of electrical interference as my phone stopped working but my car turned on.

Also, when they were passing by, for the whole 5 minutes they were in sight swarms of birds were flying and making much noise and multiple dogs were barking.  Difficult to believe but it was like a scene straight out of a movie.

It was so out of the ordinary that me and him expected to see light from an explosion and ducked down, ready to run the opposite way.  Instead, it got quieter, but the noise still continued.

Yellow light was on both ends of the wings and in the center middle, like a circle.  The craft was dark gray or black.  We were only able to catch a glimpse and it was gone soon after.

It's not common to hear aircrafts flying by so low and so quiet, and to fly directly over his house.  We have never seen anything like it again.  We know there is an air force base in San Antonio, but it was unlike any other plane we have seen so far.  All other planes that we have spotted in the sky at that time of night are very high up, loud, and have only red and blue lights.  This craft was much closer.

I sent him running for the camera and caught a few pictures of the second one.  Not long after that, a jet (with a contrail) could be seen chasing after them.

The objects were moving East NorthEast, right at sunset set so there may have been some distortion with the sun's reflection.  However, upon zooming in with my 16 megapixel camera, there was no glare.  The sun was just below the horizon behind me when I took the pictures.  There were no clouds in the sky where these object passed by.  The duration was only about 5 minutes.

The object must have been a long ways up as the image pixels start to distort the object some when really zoomed in.  Before the image gets too distorted, the object's body can be described as horizontally cylindrical and gray metallic color.  There are no strobe lights as most aircraft have.  The tail section has a bulge on the upper side and the tail wings are attached to the side and top of the cylinder body, like a missile.

There is a strange black object on the underside.  In one picture, the black object is under the nose, while in another, the black object is under the mid section.  It is very hard to say that the object has wings, but there is a different coloration at the mid section of the object.  While the rear of the object is in generally good focus so you might say it has tail wings,  It is strange that the objects wings at the mid point of the craft are not clear.

My dad related this story many times over the years. I will relay it as accurately as possible. In 1970 

Dad was a city police officer in the small town in southeastern, Ky.  He was on duty one night when he received a radio call from the only other officer on duty to meet.  The other officer was patrolling the other side of town.

They subsequently met and the other officer told my father that he was very tired, and didn?t think he could stay awake any longer.  Dad told him to go get a nap and he would cover his patrol.  He told him to go to what at the time was an open field just outside town. He told the other officer to head that way and he would follow him to make sure he found the place and made it ok.

While following him in his own patrol car, they both noticed a bright light appear in the sky ahead of them.  It grew steadily brighter and it became clear that it was heading toward them.  Dad yelled over the radio, ?It?s going to hit you!?  He said he was sure it was going to take the lights off his partner?s car, however it just missed.  The object flew over behind a line of trees and landed.  All this time, they were talking back and forth over the radio.

They stopped, got out and begin to approach the object.  My father told many times how frightening this was, and how when his partner drew his weapon he was shaking so bad he could hear the bullets rattle in the cylinder.  Dad told him to put it away before he let it off and hurt one of them, and that it would most likely be of no use.

They approached within 35-40 yards of the object.  It was sitting flush on the ground.  There was no apparent landing gear.  It was discus (Olympic) shaped, about 25-30 feet wide, and 15 feet or so thick at the center.  It made no sound.  It omitted mostly white light from the entire object very much like a fluorescent light bulb, however there were different colors swirling within.  They were about to try to get closer when it lifted up completely silently above the tree tops, paused for moment and then took off in a flash straight up and out of sight.

They decided not to make a formal report out of fear they would not be believed and be ridiculed.

He said the ?strangest? part of the entire incident was while they were talking car to car when they first sighted the object, dispatch never heard any of it, and in fact wanted to know why neither of them had been responding.

100% Real Sighting and first interest or care of UFO's existence.  Coming home from dinner on September 25th, 2015, at approximately 9:30 pm, we don?t drink or do drugs.   My girlfriend and I were driving up the hill to our house when she said to me, what are those 3 lights?  I replied, probably helicopters as I had no interest.  As we continued up the hill she said again, look, what are those lights?  

At this point I looked up to see 3 bright orangish lights in a vertical pattern a considerable distance apart from each other.  I then said, lets stop and watch and see if they are moving, as they just appeared to be hovering.  As we stopped and watched I immediately could notice they were slightly moving but very slow.  

Immediately after I noticed they were moving slowly in our general direction, they stopped and appeared to be hovering again.  I still wasn?t too interested until, within a few seconds,I literally blinked and the bottom of the 3 lights had vanis! hed.  Now my eyes were glued to the 2 remaining lights as the bottom light disappeared faster than anything I have ever witnessed or known to exist on earth.  The next two lights and what they did are why I am writing this and now know UFO's 100% do exist.

3  The top light in the pattern of 3 lights, which is now 2 lights remaining, I watched disappear approximately 10-20 seconds after in a directly upward and out direction at a speed not from this earth.  The large bright light I could see fade in a direction, speed and distance that is impossible to be from our planet.  Rockets and Missiles are like a turtle to this speed. It was very close to light speed, just a bit slower and enough to notice direction.  As this happened I expressed my disbelief to my girlfriend and I am not sure if she saw it disappear as it vanished completely within a second or two.  However, now both our eyes are glued to the middle of the 3 lights and last one remaining.  Within 10-20 seconds the middle and last remaining light, which was a good distance lower than the top light, began to move in that same direction at a similar speed.  As we both watched the light vanish into outer space within a few seconds, exactly like the top light, we knew what we j! ust saw together was impossible to be anything known to exist from this planet.

In an effort to consolidate the information into convenient delivery, I will use this single report to relate several sightings I have recently witnessed, between the dates of August 31st, 2015 to September 16th, 2015.  I have decided to share these experiences given (a) the extraordinary nature of the various sightings; (b) my fear of forgetting details, with no written record; and (c) the non-response from MUFON of Ohio in taking down these details, following an e-mail submitted weeks ago..

I will present these sightings in bullet fashion, with emphasis on brevity and unique, distinguishing details.

August 31st, , @ 21:15: I stepped outside to our covered back patio, and ?heard? a thought that said:  Go to the yard and look up at the sky.  With no hesitation, I acted on this thought and with clear view of the sky, I looked up and proceeded to witness something remarkable.  One star, in stasis with other stars, went from a notably idle state to, suddenly, scanning across the sky, east to west.  It proceeded to slow down, and then took a 90-degree turn to the right, heading north.  As it went north, its body?s light exponentially increased in velocity, until it appeared approximately 10x brighter than its initial glow.  Then, it disappeared. Sighting duration: 10-12 seconds.

((Note: I remember seeing two other interesting things that same night, but given the nature of, and my focus on, subsequent sightings, I cannot recall their defining characteristics.)  September 1st, 2015, @ approx. 21:00:  From same location, I (and a few family members) observed a glowing orb of light, low in the western sky, which interchanged between colors of orange, red, yellow, and white. Lights pulsed.  The object barely moved, but did venture downward re: our line of sight.  Sighting duration:  15 minutes.

September 3rd, 2015, @ 21:30 ? 23:30:  Given the nature of recent sightings, I developed new interest to taking a look at the night sky.  On this night, I saw three quick flashes of light ?imagine lights flashing once from three points of a triangle?around Sirius.  On this same evening, I saw something fly much lower, and it pulsed multiple (15+) lights at once, with lights varying in color with each pulse. Colors were of warmer nature.  Sighting duration(s): 3 Flashes: 2 seconds; ?Pulsing? craft: 1 minute.

 Please note:  Over the course of these evenings, I do indeed see multiple planes, helicopters, and accumulatively, about 10 shooting stars.

September 8th, 2015 @ 18:30:  As sun set in the West, I watched as a plane descended, heading east from west, and I took it upon myself to observe its lighting patterns, in an effort to further inform myself on possible plane ID factors for nighttime observations.  It was low in altitude, and its descent east was done to prepare for a loop-around to land at the airport, south of my location.  As I watched the plane go to the east of me, I saw ? quite clearly, unambiguously, and with complete surprise ? a white ?cigar? craft, ?hovering? at about the same altitude as the plane.  It had no wings, no windows, and it resembled a white stick, traveling from north to south at leisurely speed.  *I could see both the plane and the cigar in the same ?frame? of sight.*  It went behind some trees, and I did not think to keep track of it, as I was in a state of surprise and amazement.  Sighting duration: 15 seconds.

 Note: While the video is not the best, the cigar I witnessed looked and moved exactly like the one featured in this video I found after a search online, about one week after the sighting.  In my viewing, it was closer to me than it was in this seemingly-sound videoed sighting.  Link: 

http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=1eb_1434824886  

September 8th, 2015 @ 22:00: I observed a ?star? ? similar to my first sighting ? scan across the sky, going from north to south, to the east of me. It traveled quickly, but not at any immense rapidity, and I managed to make a call to have another person come outside and see it. Just as they stepped out, I lost sight of the ?star? behind a backyard tree, and could not locate it when I rushed to other side. After this person returned inside, an identical light quickly crossed from south to north, in the western sky, before disappearing. Sighting(s) duration: 1st star: 40 seconds; 2nd star: 10 seconds.

 September 16th @ 22:00 - September 17th, 2015 @ 6:00: With another witness, we watched as three lights slowly rose (two to the north of us, and one to the east). The eastern light pulsed with very strong flashes of color, and at one point, a ?bloated-seeming? airliner passed underneath it at what appeared to be very close proximity. Of the two northern lights, one seemed rather stationary, while the other moved closer to it, but farther in the northern direction (as in compass, not upward height) than when we first saw it.

 Later this evening, or rather in the morning, at approx. 5:00, I saw two lights (larger than the ?stars? but not by much) which appeared to travel north to south, east of me, and then ?phase? out, in a way I can only describe as if they moved beyond an invisibility cloak ? in other words: when their body passed respective fixed points, they disappeared, but not all at once, and quite unlike the shooting stars I had also seen that night (which would streak very quickly, and disappear quickly). Sighting(s) duration: approx. 7 seconds, and 3 seconds.

 Then, at approx. 5:40, a light to the east rose slowly (but quickly compared to the rest of the sky?s scan). I have heard mention of Venus appearing very brightly this past month, and with respect to this single sighting, I do make room that I may have been looking at Venus. However, a few things to point out: (a) This light was easily the brightest light I have ever seen in the sky, excluding the sun during the day; brighter than the moon. (b) There was no definite shape to the light; its glow was a very bright, very concentrated golden light, and it hurt to look at it (similar to the sun). (c) My cell phone can barely record the moon when it is full, and it cannot catch the stars at night, nor any of my other night sightings, but it was able to register this object, with ONE major exception: the light, as I saw it, was an amorphous sunshine-like light; my phone?s camera?s capture has it as a rounded orb, which flashes every single imaginable color. *I am very curious as to! why this may be, and if this is the case with Venus or other planetary cell phone video captures.* A few other locals whom I have spoken to have made mention of seeing this very bright light once or twice this month. Sighting duration: 30 minutes.

 A note on the observer: Until August 31st, I *never* claimed to have seen any Unidentified Flying Object. I am in my mid-twenties, and with my field of work and studies, I am prone to engaging my imagination's muscle. However, I would say say that this does not mean I cannot control my imagination's affect, but rather that my awareness of my imagination has given me a good grasp on what I may make up, as an artist, against what I have now seen with my own eyes, for the very first time. I do hope that these are not the last of my sightings. This month's activity and sightings can be summed up, for me, as quite extraordinary, and, already, privately treasured.","Student/Interlocutor",1,1,"cigar",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2015,2010,3,9,18,"Evening","Midwest",0,1,0,1,0

Just a couple minutes before 8pm on the evening of Sept 24/15 i went outside to my backyard with my dog to have a cigarette.  I walked up to the hill (4 steps off the deck) and i looked up to the sky (the sky was that blue night sky not dark black) i see this huge what appeared like a star but was massive and so close.  I knew 100% this isnt right and just then all these pink tesla ball tentacles started coming off of this "" star "" looking thing and within a second - it seemed as if this "" star "" turned inside out of itself and i could see orange and blue lights merged together and WHAM!  I see this dark shape with lights (not blinking) coming towards my house.  I never once took my eyes off of it and as it went over my house i could see the bottom and full shape of the object.  It was in the shape of a row boat /bullet. It 100% had no wings or tail.  The lower bottom had two lights that were peach orange and in the shape of those cement park barriers that lay on the ground in a parking space - they were vertigo - one on far left and other on far right.  Above these two lights was a large circular ball light of blue.  None of these lights blinked at all and stayed on.  The craft gave off a sound that i unfortunately can not describe because i have never heard a sound like that to compare.  I thought there was something wrong with it mechanically because of sound but perhaps that is the way it sounds normally..  i really don't know.

It was the size of a large building and moved slow but steady over the house.

When the object went over me i could feel a numb sorta tingly feeling within both arms, neck and my head.  What i found strange is that i knew it was a UFO but i just all calm like walked back into my house looking at my arms and thinking "" they are real "" I felt this sensation for 1hr and 9mins.

Also, when i came in the house i looked at the time and no more then 2 mins had passed. I drew the craft and wrote some details within a minute of being in the house.

This was seen last Saturday at 10:06 pm.  At first I thought these were missiles or some type of military aircraft.  Many people all over the world  have witnessed these strange lights.  I've never seen this in my life.  

These lights looked like circular fire balls and  don't resemble anything military grade as they made no noise and seemed to fly fairly low but not close enough to visibly see what the object was.  Nor do I believe they are Chinese lanterns or any type of home crafted object.  I know the video is a little hard to see but you can definitely see the strange pattern of these orange lights, it's almost as if they were following each other.

I grew up in Drove, Germany (originally born in Long Beach,CA).  Very close to Drove was the so called ""Drover Heide,"" which is a large open area with a lot of heather and little birch tree groups.

It used to be a military training ground for about 200 years and it was strictly forbidden to enter it ( it was also very dangerous because of old ammunition that was everywhere).

At the other end of the Drover Heide was an American military base with the type ""Nike"" defense missiles.

As kids we used to play on the drover heide and in the woods around it and when the military activity got less in the early '90's, I started to go searching on the drover heide first just for old musket lead balls, but later, I also started taking artillery and mortar grenades home (I used a cheap metal detector).  I then disarmed them and later blew the explosives up at night in the forest with some friends (just for fun and bragging rights).

I know now that this was extremely dangerous and also illegal, but when I was 16, it was my hobby and important to me.

One day I was searching at a dangerous spot again and heard a strange noise.  I could not tell exactly what it was and where it came from.  When I looked around I couldn't see anything.

I thought it was possibly a vehicle from the military police so I got a little nervous.  It didn't really sound like a car however so I kept on searching.

About 5 minutes later, two young men (maybe 20-25 years old) where standing about 10 meters away from me.  They where identical twins with short brown hair and also identical clothing (dark grey-black color).  Their clothing looked more like some type of uniform/ jogging suit.  They where about as tall as I was back then (6 feet).

They both smiled at me and one asked me what I was doing.  I didn't want to tell them the truth so I told them that I was just looking for old musket bullets.  Then they smiled and walked away.

Maybe I am just overreacting or paranoid, but I don't think that these 2 young men where normal humans.  I have never seen them afterwards again.

Meeting anybody back then on the Drover Heide was very very rare because everybody was afraid of the military police.

I was a recent college graduate, on my way to a teaching interview.  On about Monday, July 26, 1976, I was traveling southbound on US 287 between Kit Carson and Hugo in Colorado.  I don't know if I was in Elbert or Lincoln County, at that point on the highway. The road is very lightly traveled, so no other traffic was observed.  The time of day was approximately 12-1 PM. The weather was calm, clear and sunny.  The area was ranch land. I don?t think there were any buildings in sight.  As I drove along, at about a speed of 60 miles per hour, I saw a black cylindrical object in the distance, in the air, on my left, no more than 30 yards off the highway, with its length parallel to it.  It seemed to float at about the height of a telephone pole above the ground.  The landscape on that side (East) of the road is fairly flat prairie, with dry prairie grass.

As I slowed down and approached, the object appeared to be stationary above the ground with no visible support.  When I reached a point perhaps 30 yards before reaching the point perpendicular to the leading end of the object, I pulled over to the right shoulder, got out and leaned against the front fender of my car and ate a sandwich.  Now I could detect that the object was indeed moving, almost imperceptibly, from my right to my left, staying parallel to the highway.  It did not seem at all effected by gravity, which I thought very odd, given that I knew of no ?antigravity? technology which could prevent an object moving so very slowly from falling to the ground. Its altitude appeared constant as it moved.  The motion and course appeared to be steady. If anyone was inside of it, I could not tell if they noticed me by any change in the movement of the object.

The object, which I could see very clearly, I estimated to myself to be approximately 8-12 feet in diameter, about the length of a residential housing lot width, ~60 feet long and uniformly cylindrical.  The color was flat black, with about 8 feet of non-reflective silver covering each end.  The surface of the object was not perfectly smooth, but I could not recognize anything that resembled construction, such as riveting that one might see on a man-made craft; having no doors or windows on the side exposed to my view.  There was absolutely no humanly detectable sound coming from it.  It seemed spooky, but I felt no unusual fear, other than of the unknown.  Its progress seemed like a train slowly passing on a track.

I watched it for about 5 minutes, until it was quartering off the rear fender of my car.  I had moved approximately twice its length in five minutes.  I suspect I could have watched it indefinitely, but I couldn?t risk being late for my interview.  Of course, I had no camera with me. :(  After taking the job, in extreme SE Colorado, I told my neighbor, a rancher, about my observations. He said he?d heard that area was a secret testing area for the US military.  I asked if he just heard that as a rumor among other area ranchers or if his AF service had given him reason to think that.  He hedged. I don?t know.  This was before cruise missiles and stealth aircraft became public knowledge.  But the craft style and behavior is very odd outside of other UFO sightings, even today (2015).  I suspect that the object was a prototype testing craft for highly classified technologies, but if so, then why so close to a highway and possible public observation?  The similarity to other sightings people have reported intrigues me.

Walking westward down a quiet residential street just after dark, I watched several low and high flying planes coming and going from both Miami International and Opa Locka Executive airports.  Looking just over my left shoulder as I scanned the mostly clear sky, I suddenly witnessed a very unusual object streak by just over the treetops (an altitude of only about 50 - 60 ft.)  It was traveling in straight level line at about the speed of a fast moving bird (40 mph?) while throwing off a trail of sparks.  It was in my view for only about 2 or 3 seconds and disappeared over the houses and trees.  The object itself was not visible, only electric sparks emanating from a thin line probably about a foot or so long. There was no smoke, odor or sound.

It looked very much like a 4th of July sparkler shooting through the air like a missile or an arrow, very similar in size, shape and intensity.  Another comparison would be to the tracers they shoot off with fireworks.  The difference was in the trajectory.  This thing moved like it was under its own power and headed somewhere with a purpose.  It wasn?t ascending, descending, or decelerating as one would expect if it was a bottle rocket or some other kind of model rocket or firework and it didn?t explode with a bang.  Also, if it was something like that, I can?t understand how someone could be in a position to direct it along such a horizontal line of flight.

Another explanation would be some highly unusual atmospheric effect, but even with sparks flying, it wasn?t high voltage lighting.  It was a calm breezy evening with clear skies except for a few puffy clouds here and there, no charged feeling like we get when thunderstorms roll through.  There were no power lines or street light wires anywhere nearby.

((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD))","Strange light and trajectory of spherical object seen offshore west of San Diego,1805 PT, 7 Nov 2015.





I just turned on to the street on which our house is located.  Maplewood St  Poway CA is a street that basically runs in a northeast to southwest direction  and intersects with twin peaks.  I was driving east on twin Peaks and turned right heading southwest on Maplewood.  I noted a object streaking in a south to north direction through the sky maybe 30 Deg above the horizon leaving a trail that appeared to be 6-12 inches long, as compared to 2-3 fist lengths at arms length.  The leading sphere was orange in color.  My initial thoughts were a meteor as the object was not really changing elevation.  As I was pulling into my driveway a time span from my first sighting, maybe 30 seconds the tail began to dissipate in length to no visible tail.  At this point I had gotten out of my vehicle and was walking up to the front door.  As I approached the door I yelled for my wife to come check it out as it was changing color from a burnt orange to white and had stopped ! tracking south to north and became stationary.  The sphere became extremely bright white and hovered at a constant location with minor oscillations.  This transition from moving object to stopped object changing color from orange to bright white was maybe 45 seconds.  At this point my wife came outside and I showed her the object.  The object then appeared to move in a westerly direction from stationary on a slightly upward trajectory but maybe only a 5 deg increase.  It appeared to be moving away and the sphere began to decrease in diameter.  There was a bright blue halo trailing the object which became oblong.  Over a period of another 45-90 seconds the object continued to receded from our position.  However the bluish contrail remained for a additional 5-30 seconds .

For some background I am a mechanical engineer.  I worked at CCAFS in FL for a period of one year working for General Dynamics on the Atlas program.  I have witnessed more that 6 night launches of vehicle ranging from Delta, Titan, Atlas II & Atlas V and STS.  I have seen launches in dead night and near sunset and sunrise.

The brilliant white light which trailed away from our view location was unlike any propulsion system glow I have ever witnessed.  The color and shape of the plume was unlike any chemical rocket plume. Additionally the brilliant white color was brighter and very consistent in color density.  Again unlike any view I have ever witnessed in the launch industry.

What was out of place? 1. Transitioning from south to north travel at a constant horizon height to stopped.  Tail to no tail and change of color.

2. Color of sphere or propulsion.

3. Unlike any medium to large chemical rocket launch I have ever witnessed.

No small missile launched off a military vessel displays this brilliant white propulsion system.  I have witnessed launches from VAFB of Atlas, Peacekeeper and Delta from this same location on Maplewood over the years.  What can I say I worked in the rocket industry so it was a pleasure to watch night launches especially if they occurred shortly after sunset as you would get good reflection of the vehicle and exhaust.

There is no way this was a military launch.","Engineer",2,1,"sphere",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD",NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2015,2010,4,11,18,"Evening","West",0,1,0,0,0

I've seen many such launches and this was very different.  And this was silent.  No noise.  Just a bright sharp beam of light that sliced the sky and made a large area of the sky glow green, even after the beam left.  Two of us saw it.

It was a light that seemed to come in towards us slowly, then it backed out as fast as it had appeared-finally fading to black (full night sky).  The entire experience lasted about 15 minutes, as the glow remnant took this long to dissipate fully.

At first we thought that we were witnessing an aircraft/drone (silent) headed directly towards us at about 25mph due to a bright whitish-green ?spotlight? approaching us.

At 6:01 in the evening as we were starting our nightly walk with the dogs we noticed a very bright light, shaped like a funnel so that it  had the appearance of a searchlight.  So much so in fact, that we thought it was a helicopter.  We quickly realized that it was something much different.  The light was a bright white flame and there was smoke swirling around this flaming cone  of light.  No sound, spooky.  I started to focus my phone camera and saw that at the front, leading the white flame was a dark cone shape.  The shape was visible for seconds while we were at an angle to see what looked like the flaming bottom of a large cone shape.  As it continue noiselessly across the night sky the flame disappeared from view and except for a few wisps of smoke the sky seemed to revert to its normal inky beauty.  The streetlights made it hard to follow but we did pick up a faint outline of a cone moving up and away from us at what seemed to be a 90? angle to the horizon.  The general consensus among our group was that we saw a rocket fly overhead.  Still not sure what it was.

November 7, 2015 At approximately 6:00 pm as I was getting out of my car I noticed a very bright light in the W/SW sky at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon.   As the light moved across the sky left to right, all of a sudden, and very quickly, a large white bright tail in the shape of a fan formed.  The fan shape was in a horizontal position and not vertical as one might see from a rocket.  The fan dissipated rather quickly as the object continued across the sky in a northerly direction. As the fan dissipated, there was a distinct blue/green color that remained in the sky for quite a while as the object continued in the apparent northerly direction.  Then as the object was almost directly west from my location it appeared to lose intensity as if it was going away from me.  I rushed into the house and grabbed my binoculars to see if I could get a better view as it was growing dimmer.  As I focused on the object, it appeared to be a circular shape with no real defining marks, and steel g! ray in color.  The color may have been affected by the haze around the object and that it was starting to get dimmer.  However, it did appear to be alternating in brightness intensity that was discernable through the binoculars.  The light continued to dim, again as if it was moving away from my location, and within 20/30 seconds the circular shape was no longer visible.  The barely visible light then had ?light tails? above and below the object, not behind, until it was no longer visible.  The entire ?show? lasted until about 6:20, and there was only one object as far as I could determine.   However, the blue/green color in the sky noted above lasted for another 10 minutes or so, and didn?t seem to move from the location where I first noticed it.  Our house is in the flight path of planes landing at the Orange County Airport, and there were also several helicopters in the sky at the time.  I?m sure some of them had to see this as well.  The night sky was completely clear w! ithout any clouds.

I am a retired civil engineer without any background in UFOs.  I do watch the sky for satellites, but only occasionally as there is so much residual light in So. Cal.

Saturday 11/7/2015 Escondido, CA  Around 6pm my wife pointed to the sky and exclaimed, ""What's that?!""  I looked up to the west and saw something flying across the sky with a very long fiery tail behind it, on the order or hundreds if not thousands of feet long. It looked like what I imagine a rocket would at night.

The tail fizzled out within 10 or 15 seconds, but the object kept flying. Then a giant spherical smoke cloud eminated, which quickly kept expanding towards us. The cloud also had an iridescence to it, sort of greenish blue, which kept glowing for a few minutes. It was very ominous. My wife asked if we should leave the area, but I was overwhelmed with curiousity and elected to stick it out.

 After the cloud appeared, the made a slow turn away from us, maybe 90 degrees, and kept flying. It remained visible for a few minutes, before being washed out by local light pollution.

I'm VERY curious to know what this was, or if anyone else saw it (other airplane in the area flew near the cloud, so check FAA reports too).

It?s 6pm Saturday November 7, 2015 in rural Templeton, CA.  I arrived home and stopped at the bottom of my driveway to manually put my truck in 4 wheel drive so I can drive up to the house without spinning my tires on the dirt driveway.

 Just as I locked the hubs on my front wheels I noticed a very bright light above the home across the road from me. It looked like a huge comet with a large blueish tail and a huge funnel shape fan head with a bright light at the apex.  It was traveling from the southeast toward the west.  The widest side of the funnel took up about 20 degrees of sky which was as wide as my hand held at arm?s length with fingers up.  It was traveling parallel to the horizon.

 By the time I reached the top of the driveway and called my wife to come and look, the lights had faded and the bright point of light in front had vanished, however the tail was still glowing blueish white but seemed out of focus and was fading away.  The entire incident took about 10 minutes and the tail remained for about another 5 or so. I?ve never seen anything like it.

From our perspective it then transformed into a triangular shape shape of light, increasing rapidly in size still with a bright point at the front leaving an extremely large triangle of light behind it and eventually lighting the entire sky.

I figured it was a helicopter and asked my wife to look at it. her response was surprising.  She had a better view of the object and became very startled at what she was seeing. the object began to take a crescent pattern and then went dark.

Driving on I-5 South, south west of Chico CA two of us observed what at first looked like a helicopter facing east shining a spot beam across the sky (not pointing down). There was a very distinct blue cylinder of light emanating from a bright white light which had crisp lines as if it was perfectly uniform in width, it extended a few degrees of azimuth across the sky. Additionally there was a smaller but much wider cone of whitish light emanating in the same direction. However this object was way too high to be a helicopter. The helicopter comparison would seem logical if the object was 100 or 1000 times closer.

 We stared at this object for what felt like a few minutes discussing what it could be. During this time it became obvious that is not a helicopter and not static as it seemed. Then we noticed the object was moving west and the white light in the shape of a cone moved with it, the blue light column was still there pointing east (not at the ground). At this point it looked like the bright spot of light was the rear of the object and the cone seemed to be the effect as the object moved, kind of like a wake. This conical wake was impossibly big though.

 As we drove the object moved an extremely long distance West or WSW. The crisp cylinder of blue light appeared to smear and slowly fade over a few more minutes. During this time we could see the cone of light remain while the bright light of the object continued west. As it moved, narrower cones were created. While we were still looking at the blue light cylinder (now smeared, no more distinct lines) we commented how it was blue. I traced the object west and we saw two pickup trucks pulled over on the side of the road liking in the same direction as the event with their phones out.

 Eventually you could trace the object until it was extremely far away. At this point a fainter cone of light was behind it and looked to pointing up.

 To better clarify, the blue cylinder looked like a very bright light until it dissipated 5 minutes after it showed up, the conical ""light"" seemed to not really be light. A good analogy would be that space craft reentry vehicle having a large cone of disturbance behind it, however it would have been impossibly large as the object was so far away.

 I am an electrical engineer specializing in real time digital signal processing for high precision GPS receivers and the other observer is a general contractor. Both late 30s driving back from a fly fishing trip. I am VERY interested in hearing back from anyone with an explanation for this, whether it can be explained by a natural phenomenon and any other reports of this incident. I would expect 100s or 1000s of people should have seen it due to the duration and nature.","Electrical Engineer",2,1,"unknown",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"US Navy missile launch.

I was outside just after sunset at approximately 6:05 PST when out of the South from the direction of San Jose I notice a bright pinpoint of light. At first it looked like an aircraft light in the sky, but as I watched it began projecting two searchlights from underneath, creating a V-shape of light, like two searchlights. Then I noticed the lights were creating a cloud or mist in the sky where the shone. The intensity of the searchlights grew in size and intensity as I watched. The searchlight-like beams below the light stretched down and grew brighter. Two distinct beams were being projected at about a 30 degree angle below and to the left of the light. The light appeared to be at a high altitude, and I thought at first it was a satellite reentering Earth?s atmosphere. It was moving at a rate of speed similar to an aircraft, and as it moved Northwest, the beams grew in intensity. The cloud beneath it remained luminescent for some time as the light progress! ed, and it left a separate, fainter blue-colored trail, behind it marking it?s direction of travel. As I watched the light went behind some tall trees, and I lost sight of it. It reappeared much dimmer when it emerged from the trees, with no lights projecting from beneath it. It slowed, and became an amorphous light (more like Haley?s comet the last time it came around) and seemed to change shape, from a point of light to a vertical shape. I watched for another couple of minutes as it grew dimmer, changing direction and heading Westward towards the ocean until I could no longer see it.

At approximately 1800, looking south about 25-30o above the horizon, I observed what looked like a plane coming through the clouds or fog, heading in a north-westerly direction.  As planes do use that corridor fairly regularly, I paused to watch as it was very bright.  There were no flashing lights or sounds of an aircraft.  It appeared that there were two white lights in close proximity to each other, such as would be found on an airliner.  The object moved somewhat slowly and I guessed it was about 4-6 miles away.

It was not a helicopter as far as I could tell.  I then looked around the sky and realized there were no other clouds or any fog.! The ?spotlight? was in fact a trail of smoke/vapor, etc., and it was about 20o long and continued into a much larger marshmallow-shaped cloud.  I could still see the light as it continued on and seemed to curve slightly upward to the west and away from me before disappearing.  The event lasted about 2 minutes.

At approximately 6:03pm I received a call from my friend who was delivering a pizza in the Mira Mesa area, where I live. He told me that there was a bright greenish/blue spot in the sky and it was unlike any atmospheric anomaly he had ever witnessed in San Diego.

	I walked out front of my house and looked around, and spotted it immediately as it was VERY vivid. The sky was pretty clear that night so it looked like an oval indigo cloud just hanging in the middle of the atmosphere west of my position, presumably over Sorrento valley or maybe La Jolla. I confirmed on the phone that I saw it too and walked into the street a bit to get a better view.

	I spotted a formation below and to the right of the cloud, not moving in the sky. It was far away and hard to see unless I looked at in my peripherals, but I could define at least one white/red pinpoint light and what appeared to be another but was too dim and too far to visibly distinguish. There could have been a cluster of them but I couldn't get my telescope out in time to see. In between the formation was a faint stream of light running vertically, looking like a stream of glowing fog. The formation would become brighter and dimmer periodically, staying in the same spot.

	Over time the blue light cloud got harder and harder to see, and the formation below began to tilt clockwise, about 30-45 degrees before I lost track of it. I observed the two from the roof of my house until they slowly faded away and eventually disappeared.

 I can't be certain of it but I believe the source of the blue glow was the formation I saw below, or it was possibly projected from the ground at Miramar MCAS nearby.","Delivery Driver",2,1,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"US Navy missile launch.

On the night of Nov 7th, my 2 sons and a friend of theirs walked out our house to the back yard, and when they did, they shouted, ""Oh my god, what is that thing!?"" I ran outside to see what was going on, and in the sky over us was a large glowing blue orb thing, with a huge circle of haze around it.  The blue was an intense, ultra blue. And it was night, so the sky was black.

 As we watched, the orb lights seemed to be moving VERY slowly, which I guess was an indication of it being pretty high in the atmosphere.  The part of the scene we saw slowly dissipated until we couldn't make it out anymore, and the circle of haze around it disappeared.

 Our friend called her grandmother who lives on the outskirts of Ramona to see if she witnessed the event, and her grandmother said yes she had been watching it for a while. She said before we saw the orb thing, she had seen some type of explosion out of the light, and she said she thinks the blue orb and haze were a result of the explosion. And the full event was over an hour.

 While we were outside, I heard our neighbors all around us freaking out over the orb and they were taking pictures too. And my kids also saw a green line on the orb, but I couldn't see this with my poorer eyesight. I did capture a bit of the event on my cell phone, but it's hard to see because it was dark and the object was not extremely bright. You can see a bit though, and hear not only us, but our neighbors talking about it too.

((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD))","White light with diffuse blue trail seen from Los Angeles

At approximately 6:00 pm I was feeding my dogs in my northeast Los Angeles backyard.   The sky was already dark as sunset in Los Angeles was at 4:55pm.  I happened to look to the west when I saw a bright white light.

The object was approximately 50 degrees above the southwest horizon.   Emanating from the point of white light was an area of illumination resembling a cone, with the tip of the cone at the light and the bottom part of the cone shining to the east toward me.  The cone of diffuse light was approximately 10 degrees in length.  This cone shaped area of illumination seemed to consist of light reflecting off air particles, similar to the way a flashlight shows a shaft of light when shined into a dusty sky.   There was no noise associated with the light.

 The object and its cone-shaped shaft of light remained stationary for a minute or two.  Then the object moved to the north very slowly until it was due west of me.  Behind the white light (extending south of the light) appeared an area of blue glow approximately 10 degrees in diameter.  The area of blue glow was diffuse and somewhat oval shaped, like a diffuse cloud.  The blue glow was pronounced at first, but slowly began to grow dim.  At this point the white cone-shaped shaft of light that had been emanating from the white point of light had disappeared.  The white point of light grew dim but still traveled northward very slowly.   The diffuse, dim blue ?cloud? remained for approximately 10 minutes and then gradually faded.   The white point of light also faded away as it traveled slowly in a northward direction.

 This may have been a rocket launch from Vandenberg Air Force base north of Los Angeles.  However, I am not sure and so decided to issue this report.  I have witnessed a few Vandenberg rocket launches from Los Angeles in the past.   This object, whatever it was, looked nothing like those previous launches.

I was driving down N. Chrisman Road toward the Tracy Defense Depot a little after 6 p.m. on Nov. 7. I saw three white lights in the night sky configured in a triangle.  They looked like an airplane.  There were other lights from airplanes in the sky, except there was a powerful cone of light shooting down toward the ground from these three lights. I thought maybe I was watching a police or military helicopter searching for something on the ground. Inside the cone of light were blue and green beams that looked like maybe they were from a powerful spotlight.  The beams were tracking the three lights and I couldn't tell if the beams were from spotlights on the ground or being beamed down from the lights. I could see lights from what looked like an airliner in front of the three lights and I thought maybe the airliner was towing some kind of device with a powerful spotlight on it. Except the three lights kept going higher and higher in the sky as the airliner flew! west toward the Bay Area. I pulled over in the dirt on W. Schulte Road before the depot. The sky was glowing green where I had first seen the three lights over the depot, except the three lights were high in the distance now headed up and to the west. They now looked like a single star like the other stars in the sky, except a faint cone of light was shooting down from it almost looking like a comet. My phone couldn't get a picture and the lights were fading higher and higher. The green glow in the clouds was still there to the south over Tracy. I tried to keep my eyes on the lights as I entered town but they disappeared in the sky behind the city lights. First time in my life I have ever seen anything like it.

I am a licensed private pilot and amateur astronomer.

At 18:01 I and 2 other witnesses viewed an object from outside our garage in San Jose. We were all looking toward the southeast watching the object together for several minutes. My son originally spotted the object. My wife got a couple of good photos.

The object appeared to e emit a cone-shaped plume of white illuminated material. There also appeared to be a lingering green beam of light behind the object. The green beam appeared to be about as wide as the full moon and very straight and consistent in its pale green color. The green beam persisted for several minutes and appeared to stretch toward the horizon behind the object.

The white plume appeared to be illuminated and appeared to grow as the object proceeded toward the west/northwest in a straight line.

After watching the objects and plume for more about a minute the plume suddenly cut off and the object continued to move ahead in a straight line. The plume expanded behind the object and appeared to be approximately 5+ degrees in width.

One other witness and I continued to watch the object move toward the western horizon. After approximately 4 minutes the object appeared to brighten and become stationary. As we continued to watch, the object appeared to change directions, turning about 90 degrees to the left heading toward the southwest.

iPhone photos will be submitted via email.

But it went from a point due south of our house to a point directly west in the 3-4 minutes when we lost it in the trees.

 The object, after we initially saw it looked very much like a comet, with a very bright, distinct ""tail"". That's when I thought it was a meteor which would burn out (baffling, because it seemed so close at first).

I grabbed my binoculars from the truck and looked at it, as it sent out an ""s"" shaped wisp of smoke or something and then an hour glass shaped illuminated smoke or something, emanating from the small round point. This happened over a period of maybe thirty seconds and it repeated this several times-I'm not sure they were at precise intervals.

I am absolutely sure others looking at the sky in this area at this time would have seen it.

 Another thought I had was that it might be a multi-stage rocket, but traveling in this direction makes no sense.

My husband and I were finished shopping at Trader Joe's in Huntington Beach, CA, at 6:05 p.m.  I was climbing into the passenger seat of our car and happened to look up in the dark night sky above the store.  It had been a clear sky during the day, no clouds.  What my husband, another lady shopper, and I saw looked like a beam of white light in the shape of a wide cone emanating from a point of origin.  When I first looked the point was bright and round, but later it seemed to disappear, but the cone of light remained, there was no sound.  My husband and I were saying to each other, ""What is that?  What is that?""  Slowly the cone of light, which was originally  quite wide began to diminish in light and faded away until all that was left was a very weak dusting of light.  After it faded out we turned and saw a lady shopper who said, ""We just shared something, but I don't know what it was.""

We were walking home from dinner when we looking into the sky and saw a bright white light almost resembling a comet and moving pretty slow at an upward diagonal angle. We stopped to watch because it looked so strange, it had a tail of white light coming out which massed into a large white cloud that appeared lit. There are absolutely no clouds in the sky tonight and everywhere around this light mass was empty sky. While the light was on the right of the cloud a thick somewhat translucent green beam was stationary coming out of the left side. The light continued to move upward and to the right and eventually got far enough away that it was no longer connected to the light cloud. When this happened the green beam also dissipated. The light cloud however remained in the sky for the next 10 minutes. The original light moved far away but remained visible, it appeared to move further up in the sky and then there seamed to be another shower like light beam extendi! ng downward. It remained in that position for roughly 5 minutes and then disappeared. We both watched this unfold as well as two other people on the street across from us.

We stepped outside to look at the Christmas Lights we just strung up. In the sky to the south west we saw this amazingly white light shining down towards the earth from a ball of white light in the sky. It was traveling at jet aircraft speeds towards the north. The white light shining down went out from the point of light at an angle towards the ground and it expanded out in a very distinct come shape that had very clear edges to it. In the center of the cone of white light was a green stripe of light that glowed like radium and nearly the same color. The point of light emitted no sound and was traveling upwards from the earth. The cone of light itself began to come apart like a fog. The point of light was going higher and higher and made a turn to the west northwest. You could see the point of light for a very long time after..probably 5 minutes or more. The cone dissipated but the green light in the center faded much slower.

It was at about 6:20pm in Mira Mesa California my father and neighbors came into the house to show me 2 lights out in the sky it is a pretty clear night as in not very many clouds in the sky.  At first we saw a bright light that seemed to shoot out of a fog or clouds almost like a energy beam and it lasted for about a minute.  After the light grew smaller and more into a shape of a circle an aqua blue light much larger in size appeared and that light was in the sky for about 10 minutes. I'd say it was about twice the size of a full moon in the sky and was in the shape of an egg. It was also some what see threw but it was a deep aqua blue color.

There also seemed to be another object to the right of the aqua blue light that was about distance wise 2 of the aqua blue lights side by side away from the aqua blue light. That object seemed to be almost cone shaped but if the cone was turned up side down, that object was a lot smaller and farther away so it was hard to see clearly because it wasn't super bright but this object seemed more like a space craft and seemed to be dropping smaller objects but it was hard to tell. This object was in the sky for about 8 minutes and was visible 2 minutes after the bright beam light disappeared.

As soon and the bright beam of light disappeared a large soiled ring shaped light was around both the aqua blue light and cone shaped object. The larger ring light was in the sky for about 8 minutes and as more time went by the larger it got. It became so big it disappeared it was huge took up most of the sky while it was still visible. Sky became clear again after the lights went away.

very difficult to describe, but basically looking at the westward skies, as I was driving, I saw what appeared to be a type of a halogen or aircraft light lite up.  At first I figured it was a plane enroute for approach, especially since I am so close to an airport, but then after looking at the light for a bit, it seemed to be far too bright to be a landing light and not to mention the direction it was coming from is not a typical approach. I am a pilot and can verify this for certain.  So any way, the light lit up, and although the skies were clear, a bright light enclosed by a cone shaped ""canopy"" was displayed.  I have never seen anything like this before - it was almost beautiful.  I am not conspiracy theorist, but I do have a solid scientific type of background, and can honestly say I was blown away by this since I've never seen anything like it before! the best way to describe the light would be similar to a movie of when a suspect is being in! terrogated by detectives in a smoky room with only a table lamp.  The light emitting from the lamp is basically similar to what I saw on a larger scale.  I was so fascinated by it, I immediately called my wife and asked her to look outside.  She didn't see the lights on, however the strangest thing she did see is that the ""clouds"" or smoke I originally saw was somehow still radiating like a bluish color even after the light diminished for several minutes.  It almost appeared as if the moon was behind the clouds, but just on a very smaller scale.  Any way, I went back home and kept on looking at the sky about half an hour later to see if I would see something again, and the skies were as clear as water; no clouds smoke or anything.  It was extremely strange, and I have never done anything of this nature as far as reporting it - but I couldn't help myself!!!

At 6:00pm on Saturday November 07, 2015, I was driving on S. McDowell Blvd, entering the Baywood Dr Rotary.

On my right, roughly 500 feet in the air, I saw a large matte silver cone, about 60 feet in height.

The tip was pointed upward at a 25 degree angle and the craft was rising at about 40mph.

From the bottom of the cone, a bright xenon-ish white light, roughly 10,000,000 candle watt, expended in a sharply defined line, that broadened into a conical shape, 300 feet behind it.

The craft entered low hung clouds, which illuminated the clouds but the sharply illuminated line remained, suspended in the air, much like an airline chemtrail.

The illuminated line, remained for over 3 minutes, slowly dimming, until it was barely visible.

I counted at least 7 vehicles passing by me on Baywood Dr but none had stopped to watch. One briefly entered the on-coming traffic lane, which I assume, was from watching the event.

I took out my cell phone to shoot a video but I did not record anything viable.

I am familiar with all types of aircraft, military & civilian, this was neither.

Usually when an illumination source is extinguished, so is the light it projects. This illuminated line remained after the craft & it's conical light were no longer visible.

It had a short spotlight and looked like it was pretty close to the gournd. It looked like it was 1000-2000 FT. AGL.

My wife and I witnessed this while driving south early evening 11/7/15. We actually pulled over on the side of the road, on top of a hill, on Lotus Road,  just south of Lotus, CA to witness the unusual sighting.  Because of its linear path I predicted that it was a missile of some sort or a comet.

What was fascinating was the exhaust plumage funneling from behind the craft.  The enormous exhaust plumage remained for a while - it looked like a giant mushroom, or a giant bell with complete with clapper.  The object was moving from east to west.

Was at least 15miles long and 10 miles deep. It had a white bright glow to it. And would also say it was 4 miles high. Gave me very spooky feeling. I studied it looking for oddities. on the south end of it there was a round brighter white and on the north side there was a whiter patch also. It was not a ufo i believe just more like a portal. And while watching this it is getting dimmer.  Also the sky was very clear and no other clouds around.I go back in the house come back out 5 min later.  And the white aura cloud is almost gone. but now i can see at least 3 jets flying around seeing there red becons flashing where the huge cloud area was glowing.

My sister and I were driving west on the back road from Wallaceburg to Walpole Island.  I all of a sudden noticed a white shape up high in the clear, blue sky, no clouds.  There are some trees but this was way up high beyond the tree line.  It was traveling downward. What's really weird is that it looked just like what they are calling a missile from yesterday, except it was travelling straight downward.  I can get my sister to submit her description as well.

I pointed at it and my sister seen it.  We watched it and I said ""Do you see a plane or what is in the front?  Do you see that aura around it?"" I could not see the plane but a sort of vague white shape was in the front of what looked like white chemtrails.

I drove slow so we could watch it.  It was moving straight downwards to earth but didn't really seem to be travelling very much, didn't move much, moved very slowly, despite the chemtrail behind it. Weird that it was directionally going straight downwards to earth. I looked away very briefly to watch the road and it seemed suddenly farther away. I kept watching it and it continued it same downward movement.

I had to stop at a stop sign and the object disappeared in that few seconds. We could not find it in the bright, cloudless sky anywhere. The object and it's very short chemtrail were gone.

To me, it looked just like what was seen on video the day before, no plane visible at all, some whitish thing up front with a white loop of chemtrail with a short tail of chemtrail behind it.  I didn't see that video until just now and it reminded me of what we watched today so I figured I would send in this description.  It did not look as dramatically huge.  It was quite a bit smaller than the video I seen of that ""missile"".

There are a lot of chemtrails around here.  Sometimes you can see a plane in front and sometimes not - hidden, camouflaged, and/or with an aura and then sometimes they disappear right in front of you.

After this object disappeared and within the next minute, my sister spotted a chemtrail plane coming from a different direction in the sky.  This one looked like the normal grey chem trail planes with no markings.

On Saturday, Nov. 7th 2015, at approximately 6 pm, my husband and I were driving south on the CA.101 freeway.

When we were between the 246 and the 1 highways, we noticed two illuminated ?dots?	 in the sky that seemed to be joined by a beam of light, while we were looking through the windshield on the drivers side.

This beam looked similar to a helicopter's search light, but was more narrow and did not reach the ground.

A larger ?dot? was above a smaller one and it was a glowing white.

The smaller dot below it, was slightly to the left (east) of the larger one, and was blinking. My husband saw it as glowing red and I saw it as white.

There was a beam of light between them that looked like either the upper dot was sending the beam to the lower one, or visa versa.

We began to comment on what we had seen and then noticed that the beam was gone (we did not see it disappear) and that the lower, smaller dot was moving away, slowly, to the east.

After a couple of seconds I leaned forward to look through the windshield on my side, the passenger side, and saw that there was a spiral in the sky. (I didn't see it form).

My husband looked through the windshield on my side of the car and saw it too, and pulled over beside the freeway; got out of the car and stood at the rear of the car, on the passengers side; I stayed inside and looked through the window.

The sky was dark and the spiral looked like clouds or fog that were in a round pattern with a small dark hole in the center, similar to what a satellite photo of a hurricane looks like on the TV weather news. It quickly elongated, moving to the west, towards the ocean.

As it expanded I saw a blue stream of light in the center of the ?cloud?.  The cloud became cone shaped in the front and continued moving away from us, westward.

After several seconds the formation seemed to end and the cloud dissipated, although the blue streak stayed suspended in the air for several minutes.

We continued to look to the west, in the direction that the cone-cloud had been traveling and I could see a faint plume that appeared to be going straight up, far in the distance.

I am a delivery driver  50 years old, and on Saturday night I was traveling west on robinson ave. and at about tenth st. I noticed an orange-ish golden light moving from my left to right.  I at first thought it was a helicopter but noticed it was way out there - higher than a plane would fly.  Then quite quickly the light flashed brighter like an explosion, and then I could see a trail of debris or sparks spread out behind the light.  If the light was half an inch wide in the sky the debris field was 4 inches about.  I was pointing to other drivers saying ""are you seeing this?"", and then the light changed colors to white/blue-ish and started to travel towards me.  The light then expanded in a concentric circle from the center like when you see a plane hit mach speed, - so the center light is there with this ring around expanding slowly, and this starts to fade.

It was flying at an angle that would suggest it falling and appeared the way you would think something would catch on fire and create a tail if you threw it.

The light was white/yellow in color.  It moved west for about 10 mins in the same direction I was travelling.  I never reached the cloud or dust plume along the highway before the light dissipated.

My initial impression was that it was an aircraft from the Moab airport, but it seemed too low for a fixed wing aircraft.  I thought perhaps it was a helicopter shining a light on the ground, and subsequently saw a Highway Patrol car in the median of the road (I?m certain that he would have been in a position to film this event as he was facing West).

Having heard detailed reports of the events in CA on this night, I?m almost convinced that what I saw was related, though my distance from CA makes my think I was too far to actually see that.  I?m wondering if this was part of a missile shield launch from UT to intercept something in CA.

The ship was traveling from north/west towards south/east.  It seemed to be about 5 miles out at cloud level. I say cloud level because it would enter a cloud bank and I could still see the flame reflect off the near by clouds.  It would exit a bank of clouds move into a clear area. I stopped to watch it.  

I took pictures with my phone, but, they were not clear. The video I took shows a small dot not a clear object. My first thought was that it was a nuclear missile.

On a Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, I went to get water at an outdoor water vending machine.  As I was pulling up to it, I saw what I thought was the largest spotlight I have ever seen, shining its bright light down upon the fairly small town of Rosamond, which is approximately 80 miles north of Los Angeles.  

I got out of my car, thinking at first that it was a helicopter.  I realized it was much too high in the sky for that.  I could not see what the object was because of the enormous light coming down from it, which lit up a large portion of the town.  

Suddenly something liquid, visible in the light, began spraying down from the object.  The fluid descended quite rapidly, spreading as it fell down.  

I quickly called my mom?s number so she might see the sight.  No answer. The huge light turned off and the object was gone, but I could still see the (glowing?) mist approaching in the dark.  Above, I could see a bluish/green glow left in the sky where the mist had fallen from.  

I then called my sister who lived about 6 miles outside of town because I knew she and her husband sat outside each night.  She had also seen the bright light and remnants of the bluish/green glow?but had not seen the spray fall upon the town.  I learned the next day the armed forces said they had shot a missile which had flown over the L.A. area and near our town.  But if it was a missile, why did it stop over our town to spray us with something?

I believe my girlfriend and I witnessed a meteor fragment enter the atmosphere between 5:55 and 6:15 p.m. on the night of December the 22nd 2015.  

I was speaking to her while she sat facing the east in a SUV and kept seeing flashes of light which she claimed she did not notice.  Believing it must be someone fooling with us, we ignored my curiosity.  

However within a few minutes after seeing the flashes of light, I noticed a bright object which came from the West, from California in a star burst pattern.  If you can imagine looking directly at a firework bursting before you, that is what it looked like.  The color was golden to white.  It was so large it was startling.  

Being as we are so nervous about terrorists, I almost thought it was a missile, but as it neared and I shouted at her to get out of the SUV and look up at the sky it began to resemble some type of long comet or meteor soaring very close to earth on a bit of a east southeastern direction.  Or as the ! crow flies, towards Phoenix.  It remained visible until it left our horizon line or about two minutes or less.  Once she left and went home about four minutes later I heard a loud boom from the direction which it flew.  Since we both sighted flying orange red orbs over Bullhead City, Arizona, just a few months ago.  It is interesting that so many things abound in the skies around here.  I am certain it was a meteor or some space debris but it is interesting that no one is local is saying anything about it.

She actually had to point it out to me but when she did I noticed a bright orange/red ball of light fade into brightness, hold for a second to three seconds then dim out, only to reappear in the same spot and then suddenly split into two which faded out almost immediately.

Normally we both try to throw off easy possible explanations, seeing as I have been into space and astronomy my whole life, but could not find any logical explanation other than maybe it was a missile from a military aircraft.

She came to see the very end of this appearance which was the light flaring up again only this time it split into 2 evenly sized lights which immediately faded and did not return .

As if that was not enough I was so amped up I told her I was going out front to get a better view and watch longer to try to see if I could spot patterns or anything.  Once I got out front it took a good 20-30 minutes before my next strange sighting.  This time it was a bunch of individual blinking lights.  No pattern whatsoever to how they blinked which is usually what I look for to debunk it as a known aircraft, but as I watched I noticed the blinking lights, which were much smaller and whiter than the previous one, had started to make 180 degree immediate turns.  As if they bounced off a wall and started going the opposite direction with no certain heading. For example on would go straight, immediately turn around , then suddenly head straight up or down. It was not just one it was all of them.  It literally looked as if lights were popping all around all at once  , and then as if related, the bright ball of orange/red light appeared just off to the left center of the group ! or blinking starts. only this time it flared and died out and did not return at all.  Soon after the blinking lights disappeared.  They did not leave, let me be clear of that.  They disappeared. Meaning I was watching them all blinking, and one by one , sometimes two at a time, would just vanish, and stop blinking.  I tried to think maybe cloud cover was causing the sudden loss of the lights but I pinpointed background stars in the same general area to which the lights were and could still see the stars.

Finally after my mother arrived she was getting groceries out of her truck and I was still outside maybe 10 minutes after my last sighting.  I suddenly yelled at her to look, because she is a big anti ufo person, and as she did she pointed out that it had went out and moved to the right.  I heard her then get into her truck to get more stuff while I was still staring and the light was still there it amazingly suddenly had another exactly same light appear next to it and unbelievably came together into one and vanish just like the first sighting but backwards. After which I did not see that light anymore.

No more than 30 min later I witnessed several more small blinking lights behaving really strange, like disappearing and reappearing going the opposite way, or suddenly appearing and then as if it was never there it is gone.

I know how silly this sounds but I have been a firm believer of science and facts my whole life.  For 20 years of my life I have lived at this house and looked up at the same sky countless nights without seeing something even relatively as strange.  I know how aircraft lights behave and satellites.  They have patterns.  The closest pattern any of these lights had was only once when me and my wife saw the cluster of lights blink shortly almost in sync.  I really would like to know if maybe it was just some strange military testing or flying that was going on, or possibly military flares, but the way it happened, I can't, for the life of me, begin to understand what I saw.

Object was moving extremely fast E to W.  The refection of the sun is what got my attention. Sky conditions are severe clear,bright sun.  Object appeared shiny and possible pointed in the front.

The speed either way was very fast.  No sound.  None.  Had it been a fighter at that speed it would be Mach 1 + easily.  Tracked E- W until going out of view.

On November 7, 2015, at approximately 6:00 pm, I witnessed what at first I thought were 3 airplanes following very closely to each other in the distance.  I realized that the lights were moving too slow to be 3 aircraft, so I watched them as they got closer.  When I realized that the lights were all on one ?object?, moving VERY slowly and making NO sound, I went inside to get my roommate to witness this sighting too.  The craft was ?diamond? shape with one light (white) at the front, one light (white) in the middle and one light (red) at the end.  It was heading in a northeast direction and moving very slow, like a blimp.  There was absolutely NO sound.  There were no other airplanes in the sky at this time.  My best estimation of its size is if you were to hold a dollar bill up to the sky, the length of this craft would probably have been about the length of 1/2 of the dollar bill.  

I am positive that other people saw this craft because when my daughter-in-law went to work the following Monday, one of her co-workers asked her if she saw the UFO.  It really freaked her out.  I sent an email on Sunday morning (Nov. 8, 2015) to the editor of the local newspaper (The Daily Press, Victorville, Calif.) describing what I saw and asking if there were other witnesses.  The response I got was a joke.  I was told that what I saw was going to be on the front page of the Sunday paper, a missile launch!  I emailed him back, insisting that what I saw was no missile launch.  The fact alone that it was NOT streaking across the sky should have been his first clue.  I got no follow up response.

I thought it was a helicopter until it passed directly over me and I was completely shocked. The flying object looked like a missile or a spaceship.  It was cylinder shaped with no wings, and appeared to have blue lights on the bottom.

Date of sighting between 6/1965 ? 8/1965 around 5:15pm.  Sightings reported the next day between Colorado Springs to Cheyenne, Wyoming in newspapers.

Some things are true whether you believe them or not.  This is one of those stories, but it started off one day in Daniels Park on a beautiful sunny summer afternoon.  My boyfriend Larry and I had brought a picnic to the site as it was close to my home in Littleton, Colorado, looking forward to a scenic afternoon together.  From the park, you can see Pikes Peak in the South, Mt. Evans in the West, and Longs Peak in the North, but we had no idea the sight we were about to see and it wasn?t listed in any brochure that might have been available.

We had just finished the food we had brought with us, shared on a picnic table situated close to the edge of a small cliff that overlooked the Rocky Mountains.  We took the remnants of our food to Larry?s car, placed what remained in the truck and meandered over to a tree that stood in front of the cliff.  There was a valley beyond the tree and beyond that valley were the Rocky Mountains.  Larry stood on one side of the tree, and I on the other side in awe of the sights before us.  We didn?t say a word, just looked at the view enjoying the pristine air, the trees below in the valley and the Rocky Mountain range, so close we could see the green of the pine trees.

We must have been standing there for several minutes not saying a word when something came into view that startled both of us.  As we watched, three objects came flying over the trees at great speed and so close they should have touched them.  They quickly dipped down into the valley and hovered over the ground.  I wasn?t sure if I should say something because once those words left my lips I was sure Larry would think I?d gone mad, but discretion was not something that was needed at that moment.

And so the words came out of my mouth, ?Larry do you see what I see??  Larry being as stunned as I was said, ?What is it you?re seeing??  Now the cat was out of the bag and it was time to say what I was seeing.

?That looks like flying saucers to me.  What do you see??  At this point I felt a sense of relief flowing over Larry, although neither of us moved an inch from our positions.  ?That?s what it looks like to me.?  Larry stated still in awe at what was transpiring before us.  I could hear it in his voice.

And so we stood there watching three flying saucers as they flew halfway between us and the Rocky Mountains and then stopped in midair.  A rational moment was somehow needed, so I asked Larry if he thought they were government vehicles, did he see any numbers on them.  Of course no was the answer that came back from Larry which agreed with what I could see from my location.

What followed was a four minute conversation between Larry and I trying to make sense of what was happening.  By now one of the flying saucers had gone down to the ground and the other two hovered over it.  As we were trying to figure out what they were doing one of us moved but I?m not sure which one.  I was too absorbed watching those saucers.  The one on the ground had about a three second delay and then flew up to the other two saucers.  By now my mouth was hanging open as one of the saucers started flying toward us.  My mouth flew shut as I yelled to Larry we had to get out of there.

We ran to his car as fast as our legs could carry us, arriving at the car as Larry dropped the car keys in his haste to open the door.  ?Hurry Larry, it?s almost here.?, as panic took over and all rational thoughts flew out of my head.   Larry backed up the car and started moving forward toward the road that had brought us to this spot just as the saucer started hovering over our car.

Just as a child is convinced sheets can protect them at night from scary sounds in the middle of the night, I calmed down surrounded by the safety of our car and looked up at the saucer hovering over us.    I looked at the size of the saucer, it was about 15 or 20 feet across, as far as I could tell from that location, and the bottom of it was a smooth looking type of metal without any rivets or seams of any kind.   There was no propeller and no dust flying around us.  It seemed as if the saucer was flying by some unseen force as my eyes gradually went up to the top of the saucer base.  There were clear looking windows in a circle above the base and I held my breath as I looked up in hopes of seeing what was driving this vehicle.  When I looked into the windows, all I could see was the top of the ceiling.

It was bright and sunny when I looked up and just as suddenly it was almost dark outside with me not wondering why there had been such a sudden change in the light.  Larry and I drove off into the now dimming light as the flying saucer returned to the other two saucers and flew back over the Rocky Mountains.

I was so excited on the drive home telling Larry we needed to report this incident.  We had seen this in broad daylight, we hadn?t been drinking anything alcoholic and both of us witnessed this event together.  He turned, looked at me with his face screwed up a bit and said he?d lose his job with the Air Force if he reported what we had seen as he was in training at Lowry Air Force Base.     He made me promise I wouldn?t tell anyone, not even my parents as he dropped me off at my home that evening.

I would have thought that would have been the end of our adventure, but I was surprised it wasn?t over yet.  A week went by and I was sitting in the shade of my home in the cool grass when a black car came driving up and parked in front of my house.  No one was home at that time; as a matter of fact no one was on the street at that time other than me and this black car.  I was startled to see two men come out of the vehicle.  I was startled because they both had black suits on despite the fact that it was so hot that morning.  Who?d wear black suits in this weather was my only thought as one of them approached me and the other one stayed by the car.

It?s difficult remembering that conversation other than a few significant items that have stayed in my head and will forever remain there.  He talked about what I had seen that day at Daniels Park, said that if I ever told anyone about what I?d seen my father would lose his job at Martin Marietta and they would make sure he?d not be employed again.  He was working on the Titan Missile among others things at the time.  Who were these people, how did they know my father worked for Martin Marietta and how did they know I was there that day?  I was in Larry?s car, not mine.  I thought it was silly threatening me when I had told Larry I wouldn?t say anything, but I guess they hadn?t talked to Larry.  I got a hold of Larry on the phone later in the day and was met with another surprise.

Larry told me they had been to see him and now he could never see me again.   I asked him over and over what they had said to him but he refused to tell me.  He just kept saying he?d lose his job with the Air Force if he ever saw me again.  I hung up the telephone puzzled and sad.  I had lost someone who I found to be very special to me and all because I?d seen some flying saucers in the summer of 1965.

I didn?t tell anyone what I had seen that day so long ago in Daniels Park for concern my father would lose his job with Martin Marietta, but I would have been released from that when he died.  I still kept this story quiet because of other factors that had come into play including my job with the government.

I was driving northbound on Illinois route 57N, windshields are clear/no tint  There was no oncoming traffic at the time, and only a few northbound vehicles.

I noticed from the center of the windshield coming down from the top of the windshield, a bright white streak of light which went horizontal with the horizon in front of me, from center of the windshield, moved fully across to the left lower side of the driver?s side window to the treeline.

It went from a small white steak to a long multi-colored ?tailed? streak and ending with bright green ball of light that disappeared, either from the treeline or from just burning out. It lasted 2 to 3 seconds, as it crossed the sky from what I saw? fantastic!  I had not ever seen such a fall.

On Friday night, 4/29/2016, between 9:15pm and 10:00pm, I observed 4 objects I could not identify as aircraft.  Three of the objects were egg or spherical shape, with a red/yellow/white illumination with a slight flickering of these colors. These 3 objects were separated in time by about 20 seconds, moving towards the ocean in the direction of Monterey.  Each of these 3 objects traveled at the same speed, which was slower than a small fixed wing aircraft.  Both the 1st and 2nd object appeared to stop dead in the sky, at the same point in the sky, for at least 10 seconds.  They then resumed their same speed and disappeared from view, but it seemed to me that the extinguishment of their light was not a function of moving ever farther away, the lights just went out.  Each object was the same size, and  I measured with my pinky finger held out at about 30 degrees elevation.  The object took up less than half the width of the nail of my pinky finger.  The objects were s! ilent, and emitted no trails.  I estimate the height of these objects in the hundreds, but not  thousands of feet.

I'm not sure if the third object stopped dead and moved on like the first two. I was startled to view a very fast moving streak in the sky proceeding in the general direction of these objects. The speed of this ""streak"" would be about the same as a military jet traveling at a supersonic speed at low altitude.  While I was not startled by the initial 3 ""orb like"" objects, the fast moving streak seemed ""wrong"".  Another way to describe this streak would be about the same as a meteor one can often see during meteor showers. I thought it was a meteor, but the angle thru the sky was too flat or horizontal and too low. This ""streak"" trailed a smoky, silverish color.  There was no sound. This streak quickly vanished in the direction of the other objects. I can't estimate the size of this streaking object. It was projectile shaped.

I sighted these objects on a neighborhood street where I walk every day, both day and night.  I am familiar with the behavior of aircraft - both large jets and small planes as to  their lighting and travel time in this sky, as well as to what sounds could be present, or not present.  Sometimes even small planes are silent at even short distances.  During this sighting, both light and larger aircraft were higher up in the sky. So, the progression of lights would be these unidentified objects, with light planes and commercial traffic above them, and then the stars above those aircraft.

My guess is that the first three ""orbs"" could have been lanterns, except that the first two stopped dead in the sky and then resumed their travel. Another possibility is drones. The streaking object is why I am reporting this. It seems an odd coincidence that these  slow moving ""orbs"" were chased by a very fast object.

I am writing this report about one hour after the event. I am a retired technician/engineer, 64 years old. I am offering this report in the event others may have seen some of what I did, especially the fast moving streak.

This incident has previously been documented by UFO Researchers.

In 1966, I was involved in an incident while stationed at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota. I was told to never speak of the incident again, and also told that as far as I was concerned, ?It Never Happened.?  I was a Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Officer, a First Lieutenant, and a Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander in a two man Launch Crew with my crew commander who held the rank of Major.  I was attached to the Strategic Air Command, and part of the 742nd Strategic Missile Squadron, one of three squadrons of the 455th Strategic Missile Wing based at Minot. I held a Top Secret clearance, which was required for my job.

It all began one morning when I was watching TV while having breakfast, and I heard the local news announcer mention that some residents in the town of Mohall had seen strange lights overnight, which they attributed to a UFO. This caught my attention because I was scheduled for duty that morning at a Launch Control Facility, called November Flight, about 3 miles west of Mohall and about 37 miles north of Minot Air Force Base.

I lived in the town of Minot at the time, and I drove to the airbase to attend the morning Pre-departure Briefing at Wing Headquarters, where all 15 missile crews would normally meet each day prior to ?pulling alert duty? at their respective Launch Control Facilities. During the briefing, it was mentioned that some missiles at November Flight had gone ?off alert? during the night, but no further information was provided.  I immediately connected this to the news item that I had heard earlier in the morning regarding a possible UFO sighting near the town of Mohall.

When the briefing was over, several of the launch crews seated near me commented about the news item, which they had also heard that morning, and there was speculation about a possible connection with November Flight.  My crew commander had also heard the news item, and we were both anxious and curious about what we might find as we drove out to the Launch Control Facility.

The usual procedure upon arrival was to inspect the grounds and building, but this time my commander immediately went to the security section of the building to debrief security personnel and guards.  I entered the facility from the back door and then encountered the Site Manager, a Tech. Sergeant, who immediately took me into the ?day room? and asked if I had been briefed on the previous night?s events.  I said I hadn?t.

We then proceeded toward the windows on the west side of the day room where he described to me the large object with flashing lights that had been hovering just outside the fence that night, and he spread his arms out in front of him to indicate its size.  Based on his description, I estimated that the object may have been 80 to 100 feet wide and about 100 feet from the building, maybe a bit closer.

I immediately asked if it had been a helicopter, and he said that it just hovered with no noise being heard, quite unlike the usual noisy helicopters heard from within the building.  I also asked what the flashing lights were like, but he could not answer.  They were unlike any he had ever seen; they were not like the usual beacon lights on planes, but something like a pulsating glow.

He then said that the object, while hovering close to the ground, then glided to the right toward the North end of the building out of sight.  The object then came into view from the security section of the facility, and hovered just behind and slightly to the right of the main gate, concealed partly by the large garage located within the fenced area to the right of the gate.  This location put the object almost directly above the hardened Launch Control Capsule located 60 feet below ground.  This was the Launch Crew Quarters and the Launch Control Center for the ten interconnected nuclear tipped ICBM missiles located 4 to 14 miles in all directions from the facility.

Security personnel confirmed everything that the Site Manager had related to me.  My commander and I then proceeded to take the elevator down to the Launch Control Center to relieve the two man officer crew below.  After entering the capsule, our eyes were immediately transfixed on the Launch Control Console, which showed that all missiles were off alert and unlaunchable.

The outgoing crew briefed us on the wild events that transpired overnight, and indicated that the missiles malfunctioned at the time the object was hovering directly above the capsule and next to the main gate.  We speculated on the possibility of an EMF pulse that might have created the situation.  We had no doubt, however, that the 10 outlying nuclear tipped missiles of November Flight had been compromised, tampered with, and put out of commission by the object that had paid a visit. Normally, it was quite unusual to have even one missile down, except for maintenance, and Wing Headquarters was very proud of having more than 95% up time for all 150 missiles in the Wing.

The following morning, after we had been relieved by a follow-on crew, and we had arrived topside, I attempted to further query the Flight Security Controller who had been on duty at the time of the situation, but he interrupted me and said that he had been instructed to not discuss the incident.  That is when my commander told me that he had received a call while I was on a scheduled rest break below ground, and he was told that we were to never discuss the incident.  When I asked where the directive came from, he said the OSI.

With no discussion allowed on this subject, my crew commander and I were left in limbo, and left on our own to conjure in our own minds how other similar situations might unfold and be handled.  This serious lack of follow through by the Air Force was more than bewildering and it served to keep this situation on our minds.

Altogether, there were a dozen of us involved with this incident. My commander and I were not there during the encounter, but we had to deal with the ramifications of the incident, and I will never forget the frightened emotion on the faces of topside airmen who were gathered there with me when I was briefed by the Site Manager.  Besides those of us at the Launch Control Facility, there had to be many more personnel involved, including maintenance people who had to retarget and realign the missiles, also additional security personnel to guard and protect the missile Launch Facilities, and who knows how many other concerned people there were on base.

Everyone had been silenced.  The incident was never discussed and I never heard a word of any other incident from people that I associated with. I never spoke a word about my incident for almost 40 years, and my wife never knew.

After several years of searching the internet, in hopes of finding someone who could give me a clue about my incident, I then found what was described by Captain Robert Salas and I felt an immediate joyous freedom from the haunting memory that I had harbored for so long.  I then quickly informed my wife.

Since then, I have run across several missileers from my days at Minot who were there with me in the Wing, and two of them have gone public with their own experiences.  Two others have described their unique experiences to me, but they have pleaded that I not divulge their names.  They fear losing their Air Force pension, or losing their personal integrity in keeping a secret, or of being ridiculed.  I also know of two other officers involved in incidents, but they will not admit to their secret, probably for the same fear.

And then there is the late Captain Val Smith of my squadron who was mentioned in official documents released via the Freedom of Information Act. He was interviewed by the late Dr. Allen Hynek of Blue Book fame who wrote an article in the Saturday Evening Post, published on 17 December 1966, which described the incident that Smith was involved with on 25 August 1966.

Hynek stated in that article that, ?This incident, which was not picked up by the press, is typical of the puzzling cases that I have studied during the 18 years that I have served as the Air Force's scientific consultant on the problem of UFO's.?  Just prior to release of that Post article, the Minot Daily News got wind of it and then published, on 6 December 1966, a front page news item with a major bold headline that read, ?Minot Launch Control Center ?Saucer? Cited As One Indication of Outer Space Visitors.?  In 1966, when I was at Minot, the evidence was everywhere that something quite unique was happening, but I was embedded in a shell of silence.

The Air Force knew the Truth, the Air Force knew that I knew the Truth, and that is the only reason they warned and instructed me that, ?It Never Happened.?

She was driving by herself, returning from store.  She turned north off of St. Luke Rd. onto Sunrise Rd., and about 100 yds from first house, in her peripheral vision on right (easterly), spotted basketball or oval shaped object and size, bright on front, red flames coming out back as it descended.

She believes object got as close as within about a football field length from where she was.

The youngest (about 6 yrs old) said she saw it but other child did not.  Wife's car windows were rolled up and radio going so she didn't hear anything.  Did not see any trail, only reddish flames that looked like they were extending 4 to 5 ft out back of object.

This is on gravel road in rural location.  We see meteorites all the time in the country and wife said she saw this object for approx. 5 seconds, much longer than we ever see a meteorite.  I asked her if possibly fireworks rocket and she said no way.

Coincidentaly, about an hour before, I saw a Google Earth camera car drive by my office in Marshfield, MO, so I questioned her if maybe it might have been a drone?  Maybe related to Google activity, but she didn't think it looked like a drone.

We also experience occasional low flying military aircraft on exercise, and I asked her if maybe it was a missile that got shot by accident, but she wasn't sure.  I asked if maybe an engine that fell off a jet?  She isn't sure about that.  

I called one of the local ranch hands and talked to him about it.  He hadn't seen anything, but would mention to some of the other hands and would let me know.  She is adamant that it descended from a higher altitude, in a rainbow like arc.  Did not see any crash, hear any noise or smoke or anything else after losing sight of object.

While at work from 7:30pm to 8pm, I have to be outside to supervise scheduled walking activities.  At around 7:35pm, I hear a plane flying by, and I look up to see it and in the sky east of the moon, there is this shiny object or bright light looking sphere.  It appeared to be moving very slowly to the east then stop.  But at the same time there was some clouds coming from the east slowly and stop near the object.  

I am assuming the clouds stopped due to the offshore flow coming from the west.  I thought it was too early for Venus or any star to come out with that much light in the sky.  

So it seemed awkward for the object to be a star or planet.  At 7:40pm I go inside and comeback out at 7:45pm, the object is still there. I go back inside at 7:49pm then comeback out at 7:51-52pm and it is still there but no other stars or planets in the sky yet.  At 7:55pm, I look up for a few seconds then just as I was going to look away the object took off west and disappeared.  Let me explain ?took off,? it was moving and quickly gaining momentum then sped off ultra fast until it literally disappeared.  The only thing I can describe the acceleration looking like is a top fuel dragster launching or a Javelin missile being fired, except 5-10 times faster.  

I was in shock and could not believe what happened.

Lights Over Phoenix, AZ July 2nd, 2016 9:03 PM 	I was sitting on my patio in south Scottsdale near Oldtown, when I heard a loud bang.  As I looked up towards the North West I noticed the 3 objects falling in unison.  I first thought that maybe 2 aircrafts had collided in the sky and these objects were falling debris on fire.  I started to record a video and as doing so the trailing lighted objects proceeded to move along different flight patterns, even turning and changing direction.  The altitude was way too high to be fireworks and the patterns of the lights made me think about potential rockets or missiles.  However, rockets and missiles move at a much larger rate of speed.  I?m a veteran of the U.S. Army that worked in avionics and with the knowledge I have over the Hellfire missile there?s little that relates for it to be classified as such.  There is a lot I still do not know on the subject though.  Nothing as far as I can tell makes any sense.

	I?m an avid reader of science-fiction and do believe in the possibility of many lifeforms in the universe, even intelligent life.  This is the only experience I?ve had first hand. Towards the end of my recording my roommate happens to come out and witness the lights and their maneuvers through the sky as well.  I would describe the lights to have a yellowish tint and large sparking trails following them.  Around the 40 second mark you?ll see the bottom light start to change directions more rapidly than the rest of the video with clear visibility of the trail of light behind it.  Then around the 1:01 mark all 3 lights come back and form a triangular shape in the sky.  Excuse my language in the commentary at this point too.

	Like I have stated this is my first experience with something I believe to be supernatural and I?m not sure if all the information you need is provided.  If there are any questions or need any follow up I?m more than happy to help. I immediately uploaded my video to social media, but for ease of access here is the link to the video I?ve now posted to Youtube.

At around 10:05 pm, (July 3, 2016) two people, who were star gazing witnessed three UFO?s just east of Baraboo, WI, USA.  The first was perceived as a dim red, roughly triangular light, point down, about 5? above the northern horizon moving SSW. Inspection with binoculars confirmed that this was not an aircraft, although it sometimes ?shined? as if there were navigation lights or a rotating beacon of some sort.  This wasn?t the case as, none were present when examined with the glasses.  While the first continued toward the SW, another came up fast from the SE, heading NNW from behind a bluff (long, hills about 500 feet high, the couple were on the north base of a bluff east of Baraboo).  The object continued to the NE (about thirty seconds to a minute or so from about 45? south from zenith until it passed into the earth?s shadow).

	The second object was a glowing red/orange shape, roughly triangular (point downward) until you looked at it through binoculars, when it showed as a bright yellowish light with a soft aura around it to the front and diminishing behind.  Oddly, the red orange triangular shape was not observed.  The light was rather oval in shape. When this second one neared the northern horizon, it faded and one observer realized it had passed into the earth?s penumbra.  This was evident because a black oval continued to travel without any light around it, suggesting this was a solid object that had been illuminated by the sun, rather than a self-illuminated object that had ?faded?.  While it traveled this way, the first object faded and was lost to view, about 20? from true north.  As far as the observers could guess, it continued on a southwestern heading.

	After about five minutes, a third object followed the path of the second where it had appeared over the bluff. It looked exactly the same and faded in the same place near the horizon as the second had, but could not be observed after ?vanishing? due to light conditions.  It is not impossible for this to have been the first object that was sighted moving SW, having regained altitude and followed the second?s path.

	Other observations:  No sound, no deviation in course.   ""Altitude and size are unknown, but a little simple math applying the altitude of the earth?s penumbra at 22:05 on July 3, 2016, for Baraboo at 43.4711?N by 89.7443?W would give at least the altitude for when they entered the shadow.  Observers assume that this would indicate a descent from a high altitude.  Relative size was approximately ? of a thumb nail when observed with the naked eye from the ground.  Overall shape or form is unknown. Although the object was observed in silhouette through 20 power binoculars, the ?oval? observed is far from conclusive as far as any structure is concerned.

	One witness is a former airport employee and military / combat zone veteran who has a very WIDE visual lexicon from fixed and rotary winged aircraft, flares, bombs, missiles and such. This was NOT a phenomenon of this type, nor did it seem naturally occurring.  There were no navigation lights on the object when it passed into the shadow and was observed for an additional thirty seconds until it blended in with the atmosphere.

I am now a 73 years old male, who, for over 15 years, worked in the Aerospace industries at Vandenberg AFB, in the early years of missile activity, from 1965 through 1978, Delco & Santa Barbara Research Center, in Goleta, CA.

It?s getting to be late in life, for me and I have little to lose any more, so I have decided to discuss my experiences while at Vandenberg, pertaining to UFOs.

As an Employee of Convair, MAB5, involved with the Atlas D & F series, launch facilities, with access to Bldg. 7000, I have been included in many conversations where UFOs were discussed.  I have witnessed several incidents, while launching Atlas D missiles from South Vandenberg (Point Arguello), LF04 & LF05.

Most of my tenure, at VAFB, was while it was the designated Western Test Range and part of the Strategic Air Command, or,  SAC.  While it was Military, most of the locals received critical launch activity reports from various locations all over Lompoc and Vandenberg Villiage, where most of us worked.  Because of my work with the rehab of the launch facilities after a launch, I knew of the upcoming schedules and was cleared for the Fallback areas during launches, for both Atlas and Thor missiles.

On many occasions, I was allowed to view the launches using the ?Big Eye?, a 4400mm telescope, and, later, view the Range Camera data, at Bldg. 7000.

The ?Big Eye? was used to receive immediate sight data to verify the flight profile for each missile launch.  During the Thor launches, it was imperative that the BlueStreak (much smaller missile used for gathering exhaust gases data for analysis by Douglas Aircraft to improve the main engines).  While viewing some of the launch films, it was quite common to see UFO activity paralleling the flight.  Given that for many of these years, the Thor was considered the fastest ICBM that we had, on launch.

The BlueStreak was a small, extremely fast, single stage missile used strictly for gathering various data about the missile flight.  It was fired T+10, into the exhaust trail, in the case of the Thor, to within 1,000 yards of the missile.  On many occurrences, UFOs were seen to ?catch? the BlueStreak, track with it, then speed up and ?catch? the Thor missile, tracking it for a brief time, then speed away at a terrific speed.

One thing about the launch radar units of the day:  These radar units were capable of tracking at speeds of up to 10,500 m/h.  In fact, they were used to find and identify the, at that time, Top Secret flights of the SR-71, when notified of it passing through the Hawaiian Air Space, insuring that it stayed in the flight lane it was authorized for, and it flew at a reasonable speed of 3,500 mph plus.  I mention the radar capability to address the flight of the UFOs?.the radar couldn?t track beyond the max speed.  The increase in speed was immediate and it was extraordinarily fast, outrunning both missiles.

At the time, the launch films were classified as Secret.  If they still exist, they would likely be held wherever SAC stored such data, after turning the base over to NASA.  All of the film data is analog, not digital.

A comment on the film, ?Out of the Blue?, where it describes an incident at VAFB where a UFO supposedly shot lasers at, and disrupted, what appeared to be a Titan Delta flight;  I was at VAFB at the time of the first Titan augmented flights and no such incident happened that I was aware of.

During my time at VAFB, I was a Mechanical Designer for Convair Division of General Dynamics.  I also worked for Regional Communications, GTE and General Electric on various contracts to SAC.  While at Delco and Santa Barbara Research Center (Division of Hughes), I worked on the design teams for the F16 Highspeed Fire Controller and, for SBRC, the Thermal Camera enclosure for LANDSAT IV.

Comet-like in appearance, however, the object was moving much, much slower than comet. I got about 15 - 20 seconds of view time before it disappeared from sight behind a mountain (as I was driving).

Its slow movement betrayed its large bright trail. It appeared to be separating into multiple objects (looked like 3 of them) as it disappeared from my view.

On August 18, 2016, at 20:48, myself, my mom and sister were at White Sands National Monument.  The monument was opening late that night for a special full moon event complete with military band at the dunes.  Prior to the event we were all sledding on the dunes.  I decided to do a selfie video on my IPhone 6S, while sliding down the dunes.  

After leaving later that night, headed to Silver City, NM, I was viewing the video, and noticed a silvery, metallic, somewhat round object that seemed to flip around in the sky above me.  It appeared to dart around somewhat but that could also be from me being in motion sliding down the dunes.  

We tried to debunk as a sunspot, but near the end of the video I could see a sunspot and it is not the same as what I captured in the video.  At first not sure, but when viewed in slow motion it is very visible.  

I also snapped still shots from the video which show something and it doesn't appear to be a cloud or a sunspot, but something with mass and shape.  

To my knowledge there was no aerial testing going on at the missile range that day, as the roads were still open and the monument was open, which both are normally closed during testing.

I was driving home with my boyfriend around 9:30PM from my Aunt?s house on September 22, 2016, after her birthday celebration.  I was sitting in the back of the car because the front seat had boxes on it.  As I was sitting in the back my boyfriend said, ?Look at that plane.?  I had no clue what he was talking about, since he said it was over top of our car and not in my view.  I did not pay attention to what he was saying, because I could not see anything.  Next thing you know, I just looked out the side window from where I was sitting and saw this massive object in the sky.

I just had this feeling in my gut; something was off and strange about this object.  It was shaped as if it had three missiles attached in a triangular formation.  It was black and blended into the night sky.  The object had this blinding bright light just at the nose of it not moving.  It had appeared to look like a stealth fighter shape my boyfriend stated.  It was extremely low to the ground; it was hovering right above the top of the trees.

I was confused and I had this weird feeling.  I thought my boyfriend was joking about what he was seeing, but when we rolled down the windows it was completely silent and moving extremely slow, hovering just at the top of the trees as I looked up at it.  There was something eerie about it and I just can?t stop thinking about it.  I am not sure if what I saw was anything, but I just know something hovered by tonight over the top of our car that I cannot fully explain and  unidentified.

Saw a bright greenish-blue light (with a slight trail) appear about 10 degrees over the horizon (nearly directly west), RAPIDLY moving downward to the ground and disappearing.  I assumed this was a meteor and made a joke about it being either a meteor, a missile or an UFO.

Within 10-20 seconds of this, the light reappeared at an elevation of about 40 degrees, still west of us.  It appeared to be a series of 4 extremely bright greenish-blue lights forming a circle around a dim red light.  The 4 lights were rapidly rotating around the red light (at ~15 RPM).  This object rose rapidly, made a turn to the right (north) and suddenly shot back down to the earth (nearly identical to the original sighting but at MUCH closer range).

Distance, size and speed is hard to calculate at night (and with an object of unknown size).  That said, the speed at which the object moved was roughly that of a fast moving meteor burning up in the atmosphere.  The object was also much larger on the second sighting, so I'd assume that we were much closer.","EMT",2,1,"circle",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2016,2010,4,11,19,"Evening","South",0,1,0,0,0

At 11:46 Am, November the 11th 2016.

It was loud enough that the windows on our home were shaking violently.  

I grabbed my children as my first thought was that it was a crashing airplane, or a missile.  We looked up as all of the neighbors on the street exited their homes in fright.  Up high in the sky was a ""very"" large spherical object streaming through the sky at high speeds emitting light grey smoke trailing behind.  The object was metallic in appearance, shortly around 15-20 seconds into the sighting two military jets were seen flying at high speeds toward the object.

It was clear at this point that the object was descending very fast towards the Rocky Mountains.  I am very familiar with all types of government aircraft, civilian and astronomical objects.  This was neither.  I'm not normally one to believe in the paranormal or extraterrestrials, but this was undeniable.  

The next day I checked the news and local papers and nothing was said about a sighting or an meteor crash, I found no other way to report this other than here.  (I would like to stay anonymous due to the fact that my reputation as a ((deleted--public employee)) is at risk.)

Peter Davenport, National UFO reporting center   On or about August 16, 2015, a Sunday one week before the Preside (sic.  Perseid) Meteor Shower about 11:30PM I was walking out of the main house to my bedroom apartment where I sleep,  I notice a peculiar object that resembled Meteor low in the sky around 1,200 feet in altitude and 1.5 mile away, traveling North, I saw as it passed through the partial obscured trees in the background an object the size of late model VW beetle.  This object which I thought was an meteor was emitting a trail-com of dark smoke above and white smoke below.  As the object traveled rather slow around 50 MPH I saw an aviation blue green intermediate light blinking from the aft of object and dark rotating cylinder that was turning counterclockwise which obscured the blue-green light somewhat.  The leading edge of the bow of the object was dark and I could see the wake it produced as it traveled south.  At that point the size of the bow or leading edge was about the size of the front clip of VW beetle.  As the object continued to travel it appeared to be getting smaller as if it was burning up like a traditional meteor.  However, object than started to speed up and continue to get smaller until it disappeared completely.  I continued t! o look down the trajectory of the direction traveled when it reappeared into a white flash as if it was a tracer round the size of 80 caliber bullet.  The object speed up to around 80 Mph and disappeared into the dark worm hole in the sky, and out blurted a double ring of triangle light, and inverted and the border were in aquamarine light blue. (As if it produced a smoke ring one large and one small.  This object omitted to rings of triangle light visible spectrum of light.  Each triangle of light was opaque visible light spectrum of colors inverted and with border of light blue around each of the triangle of light.  Whatever I saw was not a meteor it's impossible for meteor to disappear and produce double ring of triangular lights.  It was as if it produced or emitted double ring of triangular lights or picture a smoke ring and another smoke ring blown into and through another smoke ring.  This display of light lasted about 2.5 seconds and faded out.  I could see whatever the object was passed through into another dimension or time travel.  The hole that it passed into sky was black or darker than the night sky.  I believe I witness E.T. object traveling either forwards in time or back in time.  Unknown but unusual nothing of meteorite burning up could produce such a vast array of triangle lights.  I?ve draw sketch of what I saw however I did not include the color on the independent visible lights in swathe of brilliant color that were all in the visible field of light.

I feel, I saw something time traveling or enter into alternate dimension.

Through our windshield, we saw an AMAZING FIREBALL that was actually quite scary coming down in the farmland a little northwest of the town of Delta.  It appeared to be a meteor that was flaming down toward the land and seemed to extinguish just a couple of hundred feet before impact.  

Once he concluded that is was not the missile he thought it was, my husband remarked that some farmer is going to find a really cool meteor in his field this spring.

I am posting this a little late as we concluded this was just a larger meteor than most, however, others in Delta have been talking about seeing lights in he sky that preceded what we had observed around the same time.  I thought I would report what we saw to corroborate any other sightings that night in the area.  It was remarkably unusual.

My father ( 1926-97) recounted the following sighting to me in the 1960s, 70s and 80s:  

He recalled that he was a day laborer on the Conemaugh-Blacklick Railroad working with a sledgehammer on the track.  He had been on the job for several days on a crew of dozens to perhaps a hundred or more workers.  It was a sunny, cloudless day with a deep blue sky.  He guessed that it was mid-morning to mid-afternoon.  

All of a sudden, someone said something like:  ""Oh look!""  He looked up and saw a gigantic silver disk travelling at an incredible speed.  People gasped in awe.  After reaching a point in the sky, it came an immediate halt, hovered for many seconds to maybe a minute, then dropped a mile or two, hovered, shot across the sky, hovered, then disappeared.  It made no sound and left no vapor trail.  It had no ornamentation, but was a clean disk.  

Dad had never seen a UFO before and did not believe in them, nor was he a particularly religious or superstitious person.  He had been discharged from the Navy in December 1949, where he had driven a landing cra! ft since 1944.  He said he had been trained to judge size and distance and had used antiaircaft guns in some of his engagements in the South Pacific, as well as his ship's 14-16"" guns as a fill-in.  He estimated this UFO was approx. the size of four football fields, and travelled at speeds exceeding any aircraft he had ever see, which included some of the early jets.  Only a missile well into its flight might have equalled it.  But it stopped on a dime!  

The next day, he came to work and was told he was no longer needed.  He had not  checked to see if it was reported by the local media and had not gotten acquainted with anyone, but he did recall talking about it with somone who worked next to him.  Later, he did see the movie, ""The day the Earth Stood Still,"" and remarked that it looked alot like that craft, but he said it was much larger.

We were walking down Borough Road by Garfield Park to our car.  My daughter saw 3 hovering lights, white with red and blue and thought it was an airplane but wondered why they were silent and hovering so low, plus too small to be full sized airplanes, but very bright lights.  

The group of 3 were in a tighter formation at first.  There were more bright white lights hovering lower on the horizon by the water,  Commencement Bay Puget Sound.  We notice 9 lights and actually noticed 11 in one photo, almost as though they were meeting at the spot we saw the first 3, making a formation of some kind.  I got my phone to get pictures.  

They stayed bright white and spread out, then disappeared, most moved upward into the clouds, a few sideways, probably hovering for close to ten minutes.   

This was about 7:45 PM, Sunday, March 12th in Tacoma, WA..  We have no idea what these were.  I'm glad we got photos.

((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS))

Dear Mr. Davenport,
Thank you for your reply and information.  I looked at photos online of Chinese lanterns and don't believe that is what we saw as the objects seemed too mechanical and the movement seemed too deliberate but hovering rather than floaty, if that makes sense.  Plus they seemed larger than the photos of Chinese lanterns.  They were coming from the horizon.  I looked at the map for this area and noticed a Tacoma city park on the water called the Fuzhou Ting at Chinese Reconciliation Park.  I called to ask if they allow Chinese lanterns and if any were lit last night.  It seems Chinese lanterns are illegal in Seattle so I would assume most likely in Tacoma, too.  I am waiting to hear back from someone at the Parks Department to verify.  Being it is so chilly and rained earlier in the day, I doubt there were any weddings at the Fuzhou Ting Park.

I am wondering if there is some kind of military goings on with the nearby JBLM.  I looked up pictures of drones but these seemed too large to be a drone, at least what photos you can find online. 

I also tried to reach the Tacoma Tribune but no one has replied as well as the local Fox KCPQ affiliate.  I couldn't find anything online reporting lights in the sky.  It was all very strange, we could not stop watching it. 

 I can't believe my Galaxy 5.6 phone was able to capture what it did since the photos are no where near the brightness and clarity of what we actually saw.  We were thinking how could you not notice this but this road is quiet and with the trees and terrain, we were in the perfect spot to see what we did.  I was hoping the Fox KCPQ might show the pictures and others might come forward if they saw it but they must not be interested.  

I will submit to the online report form as soon as I get an answer from the Tacoma Parks Department about the Chinese lanterns.  The person who handles that venue is out until the 22nd so hopefully the other person I left a message with will call me back tomorrow.  I will also see if there is some way to get information from the City of Tacoma about people calling in about those lights. I looked up some videos on youtube and these lights look like what others have seen, too.    

Sincerely,  ((name deleted))

((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS))

Dear Peter,

I did not hear back from anyone I left messages with.  However, I found an information bulletin from the Tacoma Fire Department that says there are no permits allowed for any kind of incendiary releases or sky lanterns.  I would assume a Tacoma City Park nearby would not be allowed to release lanterns.

These lights that we saw look like some I found on you tube such as the ones in Missouri in 2012 and in Arlington, Texas, June 2015, in the International Business Times.  It's very strange and I also find it odd the media I tried to contact have zero interest.  You would think they would at least show the pictures to say what it is or isn't and talk about the safety of Chinese lanterns, etc... or at least verify if JBLM ((Joint Base Ft. Lewis/McChord AFB)) was doing testing of some kind or whatever they want to say it is.  I don't think it's either lanterns or drones based on what I could compare it with on the internet.  
 
I just submitted the form on the website. The photos are in the email I sent. 
 
Thank you,

Our local astronomical group visited Star Hill near Las Vegas, New Mexico, in November 1996 and November 1998 and stayed 10 days on each trip.  I got my 8 inch telescope ready for viewing the Virgo Cluster of galaxies, which comes up above the horizon at Star Hill at approximately 3:20 am local time on the morning of the 19th of November 1998.  

At 2:30 am, I was below the star Regulus and heading towards the three galaxies known M105, M96, and M96.  I spotted a green star moving slowly against the background of stars in my finder.  I switched over to my 8 inch telescope and easily picked up the object.  This green star object was moving from my right  to my left along a straight line south of Leo.

After about 5 minutes, I hollered out, ""Boys, I am tracking a moving object.""  Quickly three more telescopes were set up and started tracking the object.  Soon all 18 members of our group looked through these 4 telescopes and everyone was able to see and track this slow moving object.

According to my notes, the object stopped moving several times.  Then moved south a short distance, then stopped, paused, then resumed moving straight ahead.  Basically we were still south of the constellation of Leo.  

After about 3/4 of an hour of viewing, the other members grew tired and walked away to their own telescopes.  I continued viewing.  At 3:19 am, the green star stopped, then moved south a small distance, and stopped at another green star, or merged with, or went behind, this new green star.  

As I am observing, I was calling out to everyone else what was happening, or not happening, with this green star.  At approximately 3:35 am, something  dramatic happened.  Two  missile-like objects came through the field of view.  These objects flew on a course from the southwest to the northeast.  One object went to the left of the green star and the other object went to the right of the green star.  A white streak followed these objects.  These objects moved very quickly through the field of view.  I continued to observe this green star until 4 am.  

I grew tired and turned my attention to the Virgo cluster, which was well up by now.  However, I drew a diagram o! f the star field around where the green star finally stopped moving.  Basically, we were close to the border of Leo and Virgo constellations.","retired federal employee (physicist)",18,3,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1998,1990,4,11,2,"Night","West",0,1,0,0,0

On October 21st, 2015, I was working as a security boat captain providing security for a warship docked at BAE shipyard on the southern branch of the Elizabeth River, at approximately 130 a.m, myself and the one crew member aboard my vessel witnessed a very bizarre craft in the skies above downtown Norfolk.  The craft was flying in a southerly direction from directly over the waterside area of downtown Norfolk, proceeding towards and over the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.  

It was a beautiful night and the skies were very clear, as we could see many of the star constellation.  We were enjoying the night talking about the two CH-60 helicopters that had flown overhead thirty minutes prior, when we spotted six faint orange or yellowish colored lights in the sky, judging only from its lights; as we could not see any structural definition, we believe based on the formation of lights that it was chevron shaped.  

As the craft flew directly overhead of us, the faint lights were ! no longer visible and the craft was completely transparent, and did not have any discernible aircraft marking lights; which was very strange considering the fact it was flying through an extremely busy corridor.  We noticed a few other planes flying over in their normal landing procedure, strobes on as well as landing lights lit up, as we commonly see in the skies near Norfolk International airport. 

I am retired military, and my training as a stinger missile gunner required me to be able to identify all aircraft by their silhouette at any angle,  This was not any known aircraft I had ever seen, perhaps the most striking aspect of the incident was the complete silence surrounding it.  

In viewing several commercial airliners after the incident occurred making their normal approaches at lower altitudes and taking note of the size they appeared based on our perspective, we estimate the size craft to be about 3-4 times larger than a normal commercial jet-liner.  

The entire scene lasted about 30 seconds. 

I have never witnessed anything like this before, and I cannot even begin to  imagine the sort of technology needed to make a craft completely transparent, as well as totally silent.","Boat Captain",2,1,"chevron",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2015,2010,4,10,1,"Night","South",0,1,0,0,0

...Lahaina Maui 1985 New Year's Eve UFO-Orb was the only light as Island Electrical Power had an 'unexplained' outage 55+ minutes (reported by Newspaper) Experience...

New Year's 1985 and the revelers were working up a steam in downtown Lahaina, Maui.  My childhood Carmel friend, Mrs. ((woman's name deleted)) invited my wife, ((wife's name deleted)) and myself, ((male author's name deleted)), to celebrate New Year's Eve Maui style beginning with dinner and secured balcony seating at Lahaina's infamous Blue Max Restaurant.  ((female friend's name deleted)) husband and my childhood Surf Bro, ((male name deleted)), was busy managing the Crazy Shirts stores, working the vacation crowds and couldn't join us.  The sun set, dusk faded to darkness with the wait staff lighting R table's candles and suddenly all the electricity went off.  Shreaks, bells and sirens of the store's battery alarms went off wildly bringing immediate attention to the darkened town.  R Blue Max balcony table was right above main street, with an unobstructed view overlooking the breakwater cement wall with a clear ocean panorama across the glassy, mirror like sea with darkness setting on...  Suddenly, all alarms went silent... FLASH of LIGHT.

Directly in front of us was a UFO; silent, large, glowing sphere of golden light, hovering still, above the ocean, less than a mile away.  What was totally amazing was that the light emitted and began directly below the UFO, starting on the ocean surface...  Yes, like with the sun setting, creating a path of light, coming from over the horizon, the light from the glowing UFO sphere beamed down onto the ocean's surface, creating a spot of origin and raced to shore like a yellow brick road.  The UFO sphere's golden glow emitted no sound, provided the only light anywhere and the lit path was beckoning.

Cars quit driving on the street below, people poured out of the buildings and congregated at the breakwater cement wall to stare in silence at the huge glowing UFO sphere.  Everyone was in awe with an eerie yellow glow on their bodies, reflecting the golden UFO light.  The UFO sphere appeared to be glued, suspended in the sky, as it was positioned so extremely low that the Lanai Island was the back drop behind it...  People were packed onto the street so tight; U could not put paper between them.  The pathway of light appeared to emerge out of the ocean, distorting my understanding of the Universe, everything learned at school made no sense anymo'...  The phrase ""We R Here"" took new meaning.

Soon, I was wondering if the golden lit path over the ocean to the breakwater shore would become a cosmic walkway that everyone may hypnotically, like the Pied Piper, be summoned to walk on to and be beamed up the glowing UFO?  Walking on water?  Anything was possible now?  All conventional knowledge had just been tossed!  Time stood still, with only the light from the glowing UFO illuminating all of Lahaina...  Everyone was stunned, waiting for something to happen...  We, by default, felt controlled by this strange, silent glowing UFO, realizing U have little control of Ur Life, when a glowing sun like UFO omits Ur only light.  We now know that we don?t know anymore... Eventually, I became fearful, scared, frightened, as my Life was changed forever, knowing ""we R not alone""... With the challenge of this UFO banging on my psyche's door with the ""Big Bully Denial"" blocking any acceptance of this UFO experience.  I found myself talking to myself, a strange, nonse! nse, babbling an incoherent conversation, ""Go away and leave me alone... I want to stay here... On Earth!""  Everywhere, all lights were off, the only light was coming from the large, glowing UFO at nearly eye level to me, directly in front of everyone...  

The Maui newspaper reported the next day with a simple front page column stating that an ""unexplained electrical outage of 55 +/- minutes shut-off all electricity on the entire Island of Maui with electricity being restored, as mysteriously as it went off .""  No, none, nada, nothing, zip, zero, zilch was mentioned of the Lahaina glowing UFO sphere sighting and no interviews with anyone!  Everyone during the 1986 New Year ""daze"" that followed tried to find photographs...  None to be had!  From what I understand of the UFO ""electrical disconnect"", cameras do not function, as the camera batteries also electrically malfunction, with the same principle that caused the battery operated store alarms to stop?  Being introduced to USO (unidentified submerged objects) phenomenon of water fusion energy relationships, my inclination is that this glowing UFO sphere may have come up out of the ocean!  The UFO sphere was visible by thousands, remained still and provided the only light for over 40+/- minutes, then sped off in a wildly, squiggle flight, abruptly stopping high, almost directly overhead, while still being larger than any star.  Now, everyone looked up to keep the UFO in sight.  Some minutes later, the UFO ""burst"" into fragments like in Star Trek ""warp speed"" and Star Wars ""hyper space"" acceleration.  As suddenly as the UFO appeared, the UFO disappeared; ZAP...  Electricity was then immediately restored!  Ur mind changes, challenging all U were taught...  Religion, well, U get real religious when the unexplainable lights Ur way. No longer is the Question ""if""... ""If"" becomes reality, now real Q's begin...  One may want to deny what U have just experienced, but like an ebbing tide, eventually denial erodes to the base rock fact of the UFO experience...  I've been ""Touched by Alien Light"".  This glowing UFO sphere had no sound, was still, exhibiting the color and intensity of the sun, all electrical power stopped with the UFO presence and the electricity was restored when the UFO vanished...  As Detective Joe Friday of TV's Dragnet fame says, ""Just the facts, Mam.""   

The following year 1986, I returned with ((wife's name deleted)) to Lahaina Maui.  Driving down Main Street and coming to the breakwater cement wall looking out to my right over the ocean where the UFO light began on the ocean surface was an emerged Nuclear Submarine!  I was told that the US Navy made Lahaina a port-o-call for the Nuclear Submarine fleet.  OMG, Nuclear Submarines have a quarantine zone around them, when there or not...  How ironic, the site of the light starting in the ocean beneath the glowing UFO is now off limits because of nuclear submarines.  Go figure?  I was stunned to view the black stealth ""nuclear death"" submarine, appearing like a floating missile in the calm sea of Lahaina Maui that once was my sanctuary from a mechanized, techno-mad world, my escape since 1971?

Last night, while out on my balcony, I witnessed a bright light coming from the west, over the mountain range (Santa Ana Mountains) where I live in Corona, California.  This light moved faster then anything I have ever witnessed.  No blinking lights on it, I checked during the duration, my brother & ex-spouse were pilots, so I do pay attention to aircraft regularly.  This light continued high up into the atmosphere, way above where jets fly.  

I contacted the news stations in Los Angeles, about 60 miles west of my home, to see if they had received any calls; they reported no calls.  

During the ascent of this light or craft, a regular jet with blinking lights was crossing over the mountain range during this time, but considerably lower, as I believe the jet was landing either at Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California, or headed to Burbank (Bob Hope Airport).  The pilot had to have seen this light.  

When speaking with CBS News Station in Los Angeles, I asked the news desk if Vandenberg Air Force Base on the Central Coast of California had fired off any missiles, as they are known to do, and have been doing for the past month off and on, the news desk person told me there were no scheduled missile flights from Vandenberg until June 2017.  

I wish I could have recorded this light, but do not have the means on my flip phone.  

The local papers and web community sites listed nothing about it today.  Disappointed, as I am sure others witnessed this light.","Retired~Healthcare Administrator",1,1,"other",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2017,2010,2,5,20,"Evening","West",0,1,0,1,0

At about 9:58 pm on 7-29-17 a bright white and green light with a long trail similar to a meteor EXCEPT there was ZERO change in size, shape, color, tail, trajectory, or altitude, from horizon to horizon, and we did NOT see is diminish at all.  We were near Yelm, a town on a prairie plateau in the South Puget Sound area, with a big sky view.

The color was silver white, with a long bright white needle like tail much longer than I have ever seen with a meteor.  It had inside the small super bright oval shape a small faint green color to the core with a very short green tinting into the beginning of the tail.  The green was only by the object itself, it did not bleed into the tail more than about 5% of the overall length with its full tail.

This is more conducive of a missile, than a meteor, in that its magnitude never changed.  The light was identical to the light of small missiles, such as patriot missiles, but much faster, and much longer.  As for the flare of missiles right at the front of the propulsion fire we couldn't see well, it was too far off, but it appeared to have a faint flare to it, not quite doubling it thickness at that point only, it didn't trail at all, almost like just a blur around the start of the burn area.

This did not look at all like a meteor after initially seeing it, and it appeared to be about 40,000 to 70,000 alt., and if so, would put the speed about mach 10.  I flew flight test in Lear's, and I know what I saw.  It did not appear to change altitude in the least.

Furthermore, EVERY meteor I have seen acted identically the same.  This was only fast and bright, no other similarities to meteors.

It DID NOT flare up and fade off as meteors do.  It DID NOT have the orange and particulates that flare off meteors in about the middle of their entry to our atmosphere.  There were no sparks or glittering.

I did not have a compass with me last night, but looking at the map I put the direction of travel near 350 degrees.

As it moved across the sky to my left, the aura ceased and the point of light faded as if it had gone behind a cloud.  There wasn't a cloud in the sky.

It was Friday, December 22, in Torrance, California, around 5:30 pm.  The sky was already dark (just after twilight).  I was stuck in pre-Christmas traffic driving North on Crenshaw Boulevard just east of a local Torrance Airport.  I looked toward west from my car window and saw a bright light which appeared to be a small airplane emitting contrails, but it looked odd since it was much brighter.  As I stared, what appeared to be contrails got thicker, and as the airplane (or what I thought was an airplane) gained its altitude, contrails became massive almost exploding, leaving a bright white gas in the air.  As I observed the object which kept moving in the direction of south east, it looked like it split into two separate objects which moved together.  It almost looked like the object in front was pulling the object in the back.  It was difficult to identify since both objects were super bright or surrounded like some kind of energy field.  The object which appear! ed to be being pulled kept emitting something because whatever it was, it was shooting out some kind of white gas or energy, making circular ripples in the air.  

Other drivers were also looking up and taking videos or pictures (turning around by this time, since we were heading north in the opposite direction). Since traffic began moving,  I could not see what happened after that, but my husband and I both witnessed the incident along with many other drivers, and the objects were not airplanes.  They almost looked like they were floating, and no sound of engine or jets could be heard.

Initially visibly as a red to orange glow near the eastern horizon, this object left a visible contrail, initially orange, which gradually became white.  The diameter of the contrail varied. It closed at very high speed until it covered about two thirds of the distance between us and the eastern horizon- at which point it appeared to explode.  I have watched a number of meteor showers- and this did not resemble any meteor I have ever seen. We initially thought it was probably an aircraft catching light from the sun, which was at that time not far below the horizon.  At the point where it appeared to explode, the contrail abruptly flared into a very large white cloud covering about 20 degrees, from which two glowing spherical objects with visible discs emerged with no further trails. One went northeast at a high rate of speed and rapidly vanished; the other hung in the sky for about three minutes and then moved southeast, with less acceleration than the first ob! ject. Efforts to take pictures (we were catching a sunset with a P-900 and a D-5500, both Nikons) yielded fair shots of the cloud, but not the spheres- there were no discernable details visible by eye or digital images.

There were two lights. The light on the right was bright and remained in the same place. The light on the left illuminated the object on the right as it gradually moved off to the left. The light remained in the sky and illuminated a round area above the mountain.  It was not a spot light, it was strong and filled the sky over the mountain area.

Appx. 6:30 pm tonite an gigantic half circle of very bright light (similar to a theater spotlight) formed either on or somewhat behind the ridge of the Sandia mountains.  This is viewing from Moriarty, NM facing west.  Started as a very bright glow across the ridge of the mountain with the base spreading across the mountain top while the half circle expanded steadilt to a huge size.  Size would be similar to a large storm cloud.  Around 15 min. into the event the intensity of the light began to fade, and the half circle of light itself shrank until gone.  

Total time of event was appx. 20 minutes total.  It was definitely NOT a cloud formation.

Ashland, Oregon.

Reason for report: Flight of an unknown craft sighted as I climbed up the pass near Mt. Ashland, OR, ~1045 hours PT, 04 Feb 18.

Sky conditions:  It was a bright blue sky with a very thin altocumulus cloud layer, visibility unlimited.  Mt. Shasta was clearly visible to the south when I stopped to take a photo of the exhaust trail of the vehicle I observed.

Narrative: On 04 February 2018, I was driving on I-5 southbound in steep and winding terrain in the mountain pass near Mt. Ashland.  I saw what appeared to be a missile launch rising straight into the sky above the terrain, distance unknown, at a high relative speed.  [One of my friends lives just a few miles north of the Modesto, CA, airport: judging from air traffic approaching the Modesto Airport (on the Bay Area DYAMD arrival), the vehicle or craft I observed was flying at approximately 4 times the speed of the aircraft approaching the Bay Area from the east.]  I observed a large smoke plume, semi-conical in shape, as the vehicle shot upward; there was a slight break in the exhaust trail, then another just below the vehicle.  The upward part of the vehicle was partially obscured by a cone-shaped cloud typical of a craft passing transonic speed.  See diagram #1.

 It caught my eye because it was a straight climb upward, at a very high rate of climb and speed.

 As I was driving in steep, winding terrain, I had no opportunity to photograph what I saw until a few minutes later, I began the descent into California.  I stopped my car and took a photo of the exhaust trail which was still visible though fading somewhat.  I do have an operating high definition dash camera with a f/1.4 lens which recorded the event.  (Please see the DVD enclosed.)  The vehicle itself (please refer to diagram #2) was highly reflective; the upper part was tapered, though not with a sharp point; the lower portion was cylindrical and seemed rounded at the base: the overall shape was cylindrical, somewhat like a gelatin capsule.

 I observed the craft until it reached the thin, partially-broken cloud layer above me: though the layer was not very thick and afforded a clear view of the sky above, the vehicle disappeared.

 I want to make this very clear: this was not a contrail of a high-altitude aircraft approaching me from the south.  Those contrails are seen well above the horizon: this craft was distinctly visible, climbing at a very high relative speed, unlike an aircraft approaching at a distance at high altitude with a thin contrail. The vehicle was climbing beneath the cloud layer upward at an incredible velocity, initially leaving a pillar of smoke or exhaust, and had a cone-shaped cloud surrounding the upper portion of the craft.

 Other significant factors: Also visible were two high-speed flights of military aircraft, very small jets (from my perspective); there was a flight of two, flying in tight formation, and another group of three in a triangular formation, sighted when I stopped to photograph the exhaust trail of the vehicle.  These aircraft appeared to be flying at an altitude not more than 50% of Mt. Shasta?s elevation above the mountain (21,000-22,000 feet?) and no lower than the peak of Mt. Shasta.  What type of aircraft these were is unknown to me, but they were small, flying in formation, at high speed.","Health care analyst manager",1,1,"cylinder",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2018,2010,1,2,10,"Morning","West",0,1,0,0,0

About as fast as a meteorite, but cylinder shaped, sort of pointed on each end and long and super shiny metallic skin.  It seemed to be about 2 or 3 miles away but who can know for certain.  There was no noise or impact cloud or anything, we kept looking.  Because there were home tops, I could not actually see where it went down, but it was over Apple Valley, California, today.

Really super bizarre thing to see.  Also, it was very much solid looking and not a reflection in the car window.  Very 3 dimensional.  It had to of impacted at an super high velocity.  

One of the trippyest things I have seen in the sky.  Super fast!  Almost thought it was an ICBM, but it did not have a trail.

UFO Breaks The sound Barrier Twice?

Last night two of my friends wanted to come over to my place to hangout to have a usual guys night. We did what we always do, go out to get something to eat, have a few drinks, and come back to my place to crash.  My one friend was having some family issues so he decided to drink a little bit more (a lot more) than usual.  He then laid down in my bed when we got back and went into a deep drunken sleep.  While my other friend and I decided to stay up play some video games and talk about some things.  It was about 4:30 am when heard a very loud BOOM.  One that shook the house so hard that woke my very intoxicated friend right out of his deep slumber.  He wasn?t all there so he didn?t know what was going on.  My other friend and I on the other hand quickly looked out the window to see if there was a transformer that blew or something along those lines . We then heard the fire department sirens from down the road go off.  At that point we just assumed it was a blown transformer, but shortly after the first boom about 5 minutes we then heard another big BOOM just as loud if not louder than the first one and then saw multiple lighting bolts shock their way into the sky along with an object that shot up along with it almost as if it were some form of projectile.  Curious to see what was happening the three of us drove around by the fire department to see what was going on.  A volunteer fire fighter that I went to high school with a couple years back then told me that these loud booms came from the woods up on one of the mountains, and that they went up to see if there was a forest fire.  Some of the residents that they talked to said that they also saw the lightning bolts shock their way from towards the ground into the sky.  To top this all off the women that owns the antique store said that her dogs were acting strange, barking at nothing moments before the first boom and that her son that lives across the street were doing the same.  The fire! fighters also stated that they could find no evidence of a lig! htning s trike no smoke, fire, nothing from where the lightning originated. It makes me wonder where this ETC came from.  After processing what happened I think that this UFO broke the sound barrier as it was entering the atmosphere and did the same as it shot up and left the atmosphere. I can?t give a certain description on what this ?ufo? looked like because I thought it was a spherical shaped and my friend said it looked like the shape of a cucumber.  I?m not sure if its because this object was going fast or if it was because it was the beginning of the morning and was a little dark for us to get a good look.

From Upper Darby, I noticed a very bright stationary object in the sky to the east near the Phila. airport. It was still light out and the sky was clear.  

At first it was just a bright light, but lights began to flash around it as a passenger plane passed by at the same altitude.  

Then suddenly the light went out.  Very shortly after that, a fighter jet flew overhead, headed toward the airport.  It was close enough to see missiles on the wings and on the underside of the jet.  The jet moved slowly and noiselessly over the neighborhood, in a eastern direction toward where the object had vanished near the airport.

Dear Mr. Davenport,
I can assure you this is not a hoax.  I understand your question and was surprised myself that it was quiet; and what was odd was that it was flying low over the neighborhood.  I am ((age deleted--50's)) years old and have seen many thing in my lifetime; I know enough to know this was an out of the ordinary experience.  I regret not taking a picture; I was on my phone at the time.  I understand this sounds odd; but I wouldn't have reported it if it wasn't so odd.  My wife of 35 years encouraged me to report it.  Thank you for your inquiry.

It subtended probably 1 degree or less of the sky.  At first I thought it was a shooting star streak that sustained for a moment, however, it was perfectly straight and whitish perhaps tinted blue in color and seemed unnatural.

As we all looked up (3 people saw it).  Two additional beams of light appeared, appearing to go from east to west.  These two beams were exactly parallel to each other and very close (let?s say 1/5 of the diameter of the moon apart).  These beams subtended more like 50 degrees of the sky starting from near the eastern horizon (but none of us were sure of where it started as we were focused on the top part) and extended all the way to where we saw the first beam (next to the star Bellatrix in the Orion constellation) near the top of the sky.

The beams then rapidly wobbled (perhaps about 1/5th of the moon diameter) back and forth in unison and staying parallel to each other before fading away.  The total time was maybe 3-4 seconds for the second event.  I would say maybe 10 seconds for the whole event starting with the first small beam.

A few other facts: ?	It was a completely clear evening and the Milky Way was dimly visible.

?	The moon was not above the horizon yet.

?	The beams were very thin like a triple wide pencil line on a sheet of paper with a taper at the tip.  Imagine a very long, thin knitting needle appearing high in the sky.

?	All 3 of us saw the exact same thing and described it to each other in detail which matched.

?	The only airport is 30 miles away and I have never seen an airplane there (I have spent about 5 weeks or so in this area and viewed the sky many of these nights.  I am 100% sure it was not an airplane light, but point this out as it is the only rational explanation at first blush.

o	The sighting was on a beach just south of the town of Tamarindo, Costa Rica on the Pacific Coast.

?	The viewing was from a roof top condominium deck.

?	There was nothing natural about the appearance.

Speculatively, I would guess it was some sort of Government test of a missile defense program.  It was not natural, and no craft was visible.","Insurance Agent",3,0,"other",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2018,2010,1,3,21,"Evening",NA,0,1,0,0,0

My wife and I were walking through the parking lot of the Pepin Center in Tampa, Florida, when I pointed out to her two lights in the north-northeast sky at approximately 20 degrees from the horizon.

They were about the size and intensity of brightness as Sirius.  They were a thumb's distance apart and stationary. I pointed out to my wife that I didn't know of any constellation with stars that bright in the north sky in the Tampa area at this or any other time of the year.  After about a minute, the two stationary lights dimmed and then disappeared.

Thoroughly perplexed as to what these were - - they were not satellites, meteorites, rockets/missiles,or aircraft landing lights.  Their altitude and actual size was impossible to determine.


((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))

Good evening Mr. Davenport:

It's an honor to hear from you!

I am very familiar with the landing lights of all manner of aircraft. I am both an aviation and astronomy buff and am well acquainted with both spheres of study.

Within moments after this sighting, I did see a commercial airliner (by engine sound and configuration of landing and navigation lights, likely an Airbus A-319 or A-320 series or a Boeing 737) at about 5,000' AGL commencing a downwind (heading south for a north landing on Runway 35R) approach to Tampa International Airport(KTPA). That aircraft was due west when I spotted it - - I did wonder if anyone in it on its port side might have seen these two lights, but I suspect the lights were possibly too high and too far north to be seen in the field of vision of those in the cabin  - - I would love to know if someone did and was thinking that then!).

The color of these lights was not typical of the landing lights of any aircraft that I have seen - - they were the same color, hue and intensity of self illuminated stars or reflective sunlight on satellites.  Although aircraft landing lights can and will often appear stationary, based on distance from, and the heading of, aircraft, such light inevitably moves or grows in intensity as it heads toward you.  Landing lights are seen either coming toward you or from the side, but would not be seen heading heading away from you.  

My initial thought after knowing that these lights were not a normal part of the night sky for this part of the year was that they were satellites - - the major problem being that both of them did not move for several minutes but remained stationary.  Their fade out took about 5 seconds and was gradual and simultaneous - - both my wife and I were flummoxed by what we saw.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to e-mail or call me at

Location: Loxley Road, Stratford On Avon, Warwickshire, England.

As a 7 year old boy, I remember walking from my home down Dale Avenue to town along the Loxley Road.  It was a beautiful day with a clear blue sky.  As I walking I looked up and noticed a bullet shaped object high in the sky.  It was red / orange in color, similar to a hot metal ingot, so brighter and more orange in the center, and darker and more red on the edges.  I was walking west, and the object was moving perpendicular to me, so from North to South across the road.

In my child mind I assumed that I was looking Yuri Gagarin?s Vostok spacecraft as he was completing his orbit of the earth.  Many years later I recalled this event and with my adult and more knowledgeable mind realized this could not be Gagarin because of the flight path and size and shape of the object.

I would guess that the object was at least several thousand feet up in the sky, and with that estimation it was perhaps 50 feet long.","Ex RAF, IT, Security, Radio Presenter, Author",1,1,"other",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1961,1960,2,4,12,"Morning",NA,0,1,0,0,0

On Saturday morning, May 19th, 2018, while driving my motorcycle North on I-75 in Ohio I observed an object moving from west-north-west to east-south-east at a very high speed. There was no jinking or other manoeuvre.  The flight path was completely straight.

I did not note the mile mark, but it was at least an hour out of Piqua, and before the turn to US 30, where I would eventually link up with I-90.

I was travelling about 75 mph, and the object moved so quickly, I felt I was standing still.

My field of view was about 160 degrees and the object traversed that in about one second.

There was no sound (although to be fair, there was a fair bit of wind noise despite the fairing and windshield).

It was difficult to gauge height as the object?s shape was nothing with which I was familiar.  But to hazard a guess, probably less than 1000 feet.  But if I had been in my car, the roofline which not have let me see it. It was below the clouds (but it was not overcast ? there was plenty of sunshine).

There was no sonic boom, so I could conclude the object?s speed was less than Mach 1, but the speed with which it traversed my field of view meant to me that it was travelling between 250 to 400 mph.

The object was all gray, similar to USAF aircraft colours, but darker. I could not see engines, nor any obvious wing shape.  There were no lights, there was no trail, it emitted nothing, it stayed the same shape.  The sketch of its outline below is from memory (a day-and-a-half old).

(the sketch would not paste in this box - I will send the sketch to Mr. Davenport's e-mail address.)   My outline is poor - the front was a smooth curve (in other words, no implied cockpit ? and I did not see one).

A few minutes later I spotted an airplane making a turn off in the distance to the West a couple of miles at least. No idea what type ? but it had wings and moved as an aircraft moves, and it appeared to be very low.

The object I saw was definitely not a commercial aircraft, private propeller driven aircraft, business jet or a missile. It was not a helicopter, nor was it a civilian drone, nor was it a bird, nor a bug, nor an imperfection in my visor ? it was up, nor a floater.

I am ex-military (Canadian army officer) and I had just been to visit the USAF National Museum for the Memphis Belle exhibit ? nothing there would look like what I saw, even the experimentals, when in the air. Nor would any of ours.

I suspect it was a large drone of unique design ? but I thought no unmanned air-breathing vehicles were allowed flight over populated areas? Or maybe it was a new experimental manned aircraft and I just could not see the cockpit.

Others must have seen it, so I hope my description and others, helps narrow the identification down to a few possibles.","Project Mangement consultant for the Dept of National Defence",1,1,"other",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2018,2010,2,5,10,"Morning","Midwest",0,1,1,0,0

21:50 - While driving west on Harmony Rd., about 2 miles east from I-25, I observed a light appear very high on the horizon.  It was falling as it began to illuminate, so my immediate thought was that it was just a shooting star.  However, before I could finish that thought the light came to a very abrupt stop and became a steady in its intensity.  This of course caught my attention. I was on a call at the time and began to tell the other person what I was seeing.

As I crossed over the Harmony & I-25 overpass, heading into Fort Collins, I once again observed the light drop another 5-10 degrees closer to the horizon; going from what appeared to be a semi-fixed position, rapidly dropping, and then coming to another abrupt stop.  It was still fairly high on the horizon.

Soon after stopping it  began to increase in intensity and then rapidly dim.  It went through 3 or 4 cycles of this behavior.  On the last cycle it went completely out and looked like it had disappeared.  After about 1 minute it came back in exactly the same spot but only at about half of its previous intensity.

About 30 seconds after it had appeared again I observed it shoot out what looked like a missle towards the ground, at a 45 degree angle.  The ?missle? came out of the north side of the object.  The light coming from the projectile disappeared when it got about halfway to the ground.

21:56 - At this point I was near the Harmony & Ziegler intersection still heading west on Harmony.  At this point I observed the light once again drop at a rapid raid and abruptly stop about 5 degrees above the mountains. It appeared to be just north of horsetooth rock.

22:00 - Earlier I had told the person that I was on the phone with that I would pick them up if the light was still visible by the time I got to their house.  I wanted someone else to see what I was seeing. I arrived at 22:00 and we drove to a nearby park on Boardwalk to observe the light.

22:03 - We arrived at the park and we could see the light low on the horizon.  It initially didn?t seem like it was moving but we noticed that if we used the tops of the trees as a point of reference then we could tell that it was in fact moving but very slowly.  We made it a point to observe the few faint stars we could see and compare their movement to the light.  It was clear that the light was moving much faster than any other stats we observed.

22:10 - Other than slowly move further north the light wasn?t doing much.  It had drifted far enough north that it was behind a tall tree and we could no longer see it.  At this point we left the park and I drove them back home.  They did agree with me that the light was behaving very oddly but obviously hadn?t exhibited any of the crazy behavior like I saw a few minutes prior.

22:13 - After I dropped them off I called my mother who lives out east of I-25 near Harmony rd. I asked her if she could see a bright amber light low on the horizon, about where horsetooth rock would be.  She said she did see a light and  that it appeared to be  flickering.  I told her about my experience and she sort of laughed it off.  I told her to keep watching because I wouldn?t be surprised if it did something else.  I said good and hung up the phone.

22:15 - My mother called me back very excited because she said she saw the light move from the stationary spot she had first observed it at.  She said it was getting very bright then then quickly dimming to the point where she couldn?t see it.  This went on for about 10 minutes until it dimmed completely out.  For about a minute she assumed it was gone but then gasped and said she saw it appear further to the north.  Not unlike my experience she said it started to illuminate while it was still moving and then abruptly stopped.  It then went back into its routine of getting very bright and then dimming almost out. It did this for about 5 more minutes until it dimmed out and never re-appeared.

July 1968 Sunday evening.  I was 13 years old at the time.  I went to fill the bathtub and get ready for school the next morning.  While filling the tub, I went to close the window shade. This was about 6:30 -7:00 in the evening and was still daylight outside.  As I looked out the window my attention was drawn to a metallic looking oval object in the distance, moving very slowly along from my left field of view toward the right.  From my location on Maple Avenue in Metuchen, I could see this object was gliding slowly above the train tracks, power lines and tree line that run parallel to what was then the Pearl Street parking lot.  

I called for my mother downstairs to come and look.  At the same time another identical object appeared on the right, moving slowly left toward the other object.  They both slowly came to a stop in front of one another, then simultaneously shot straight up at such a speed that only streaks of light were visible - similar to the ?hyperspace! ? effect now seen on Star Trek.  Both oval metallic looking objects had no other features that I could see, and I had a clear view.  My mother did not arrive in time to see what I was shouting about.

I attended Franklin Junior High School in Metuchen at that time.  My homeroom teacher, who I believe lived in Union, posted a photo of the same image on the classroom bulletin board. He said he photographed it from his backyard which overlooked a reservoir.  I remember looking at it and seeing the date of August, which would have been a month after my sighting.  Years later I wrote him and left a phone message asking if I could have a copy of the photo, however I never received a reply.

The only other possible related incident occurred when my parents' next door neighbor - a retired policeman - phoned them to come outside and look at an object above Campbell School which was the next street over.  I was at a friend?s house and my mother phoned me to come home right away. She said the round object moved back and forth in a sort of zig-zag motion then ?took off?. This happened around the same time, but I don?t know the dates.

The bright light went out and a green light came on and shined on us.  The object was about 50 x 50 in size, it hovered quietly.

Then, about one minute later, it shot over the ocean and into the sky very fast.  Then a group of jets flew over as if they were trying to follow the UFO.  

The amazing part came in the morning when a General and his entourage came out and told us what we saw was a missile misfiring and not to talk about it.  We knew then the government was trying to cover this up.

Strange oval object in the sky, September 22, 2018 over Detroit, MI.

I made a turn on a street in Grosse Pointe bordering the city limits of Detroit.  As I turn right, I see the beautiful sky with pink clouds on my left.  I snapped a picture of the clouds and didn?t think more of it.

I looked at the picture again a day later and saw a strange oval object through an opening of the clouds.  If it was closer to the ground, I would guess the Goodyear Blimp.

I want to clarify before anything else, the incident could have taken place either 3 months prior or 3 months after the date entered.  All I can guarantee, is that using information such as my work history, housing history, and the travel history of my cousin; what we saw occurred within the first 6 months of 2015. No sooner and definitely not later.  The time and location however are relatively accurate, slightly before midnight and seen from 71st Ave and Bethany Home Rd and facing South.

*All the information gathered here was obtained with the help of the other witness mentioned, all matching*   During a routine weekend at my father's house, my cousin spent the night over like he?d done a number of times before.  After arriving and spending some time playing video games I decided a snack was in order.  After realizing we were low on food, and starving, we decided to make a quick run to our local Frys/Kroger store down the street.  It was around 11:15 PM when we decided on this.

Prior to leaving, and against my cousins wishes I decided to smoke a bit of marijuana to help with the pain of being an athlete.  As a long time smoker I knew this would not drastically impair my ability to walk and/or think and that it?d help me deal with the soreness in my ankles from constant soccer.  My cousin did not ingest any marijuana, alcohol, or anything of the sort prior to either arriving at my then home or leaving with me to walk to the store.

15 minutes of prepping and smoking, and 20 minutes of walking later we were nearly there. My cousin, slightly nervous about being out so late and being caught by his father, decided to call my uncle to check in and let him know we?d be in bed soon enough (a lie).  It was during this call that I, while gazing around the familiar neighborhood noticed something above me and not at all far away in the night sky.

Only after taking 5-7 seconds to repeatedly blink and rub my eyes did I gather the sense to immediately alert my cousin as to what I was experiencing.  Above us were 6-8 near white lights, forming a perfect circle and a moderately bright one at that.  Past the lights, once hyper focused you could make out the dark saucer shape the lights were obviously a part of. There wasn?t any rotation of said lights, no pulsing, and no odd details.  The object sat stationary while being viewed and emitted ZERO fumes, projectiles, and strangely enough, sound whatsoever.  It was so quiet in fact that I recall the embarrassment of being able to hear my cousin explaining to his father/my uncle what we were seeing and practically revealing that we were outside and not in my home as he?d previously described.  I could hear cars driving by us and in the distance, I could have heard crickets if there were any, just not the craft.

After about 60 or so seconds of staring, the craft proceeded to accelerate like no aircraft I?d seen in my 20+ years of living.  The object went from being the sole focus of my vision, to zooming straight upwards and decreasing in size within an instant; vanishing almost cartoonishly.

The light went from a bright light to a flashing series of lights.  OK, must be a plane.  I looked around and saw other planes in the sky.  One was to my left at eleven o?clock and heading toward the light.  I continued driving northbound and saw it out of my peripheral vision.

As I neared W. Guadalupe Road, the light seemed to have shifted position slightly to the east, but was at the same elevation, however the plane to the left had slowly moved past it.

This happened way back in 1995 and is pretty much the same story as a previous sighting post, for the exception of a few things.  

It was early evening I was sitting on the tailgate of my truck talking to my neighbor and I happened to glance up and see a very shiny aircraft not sure how high or how far away but seemed typical for conventional air craft.  I was facing northeast as the sun was going down behind me the metallic surface reflected the sunlight like a mirror which probably alerted me that something was different about this craft.  I continued to listen to her but was more interested in what I was seeing and started asking myself is this a conventional aircraft?  And then started asking her these questions:  Do hear any engine?  Do you see any strobe lights?  Do you see any wings or rudder?  

I stood up and started walking down my driveway and her Answers were no to all three as we walked together.  Then I noticed an elderly man walking slowly looking at the same object and he stopped at the end of my driveway as if to wait for us.  So all three of us were watching as it slowly turned north to Waco and I thought I would surely see a wingtip as it banked, but did not.  

Then something extraordinary happened it stopped dead still and a strange bubble of cloud surrounded it ,it reminded me of when a nuke is detonated and vaporizes the atmosphere out ahead of the explosion and then a flash of light blinded us, but I quickly shook it off to look back to see a green dot with a tracer heading north where it had been.  One of us said WOW that was weird,the old man said  Ya! I'm a retired Air force etc... and I've never seen anything like that and it is physically impossible for anyone to withstand that amount of gravitational force.I'm not sure what happened after that as we all went our separate ways, but minutes later as I was turning on the television when I heard the sound of copters getting louder and louder and louder!  

I ripped open the back door to see Three flat black attack copters with clusters of white missiles attached to the bottom flying so low that I could see there helmets like a little closer than at an air show but not close enough to feel rotor wash.  They were hauling tail as they headed from south to north.  I was so excited I wanted to join the chase like Roy in ""Close Encounters"" but knew it was futile.

It was difficult to discern a definitive shape as I was focused on what appeared to be blue/green flames near the bottom, and I was driving on the busy highway.

I thought whatever it was, was going to crash into a hill that was coming up ahead, but I saw nor felt no impact.  An object of that size would have made some sort of projectiles.

I was alone in my car but the highway was fairly busy so I would think that other drivers saw the object, as far as I could tell no one pulled over to have a look.

She was at the Costco in Rohnert Park and said there was a strange jet-stream in the sky that was glowing brightly.  The sun had already set and when I looked out the window, I was shocked by how bright this was.  It looked like a lasso in the sky.  The oval was on the top right and it trailed down to the left.

It slowly faded over 5-10 minutes.

After looking online I found this was identical to the lights seen over Reno, NV, at the same time.  However, I am in Cotati (very close to the coast - maybe 30 minutes) and I was also looking West towards the coastline.

I did not expect to actually use it but had it anyway.  In this rural-ish area, I stood in the shadows and it was dark where I was.  Looking up, I seen an orange glow in the night sky right above me.

The orange glow had a definite edge that was still a glow, not a hard edge.  It did not seem all that far above me.  I did not really like that this round glow, that seemed to be about ten feet across or so, felt like it was invading my space.

Taking a chance, I shot at it with my slingshot.  I had small ball bearings.  I did not hear any sound.  In the moment that I looked down, it moved over about fifteen feet or so.  I shot at it again.  It moved to sit over the parking lot across the road.

This event told me that such an orange light can be close enough to get with a simple slingshot and that the orange light did not like getting hit with a projectile.

I couldn't see much in my video lens on the camera because of reflections.  So I didn't know if I was getting it.  But I kept snapping anyway.  Finally I was able see the contrail in my camera.  I got some pretty good photos of the contrail.  I was certainly surprised to see the missile go completely across the sky because I wanted to take some photos of the separations of the tanks.

Well, to make a long story short (too late now), I came to my apartment which was right across the street from where I was snapping the pictures.  I hooked up the camera to the computer and began looking at the photos I got.  I noticed nothing but sky on several initial photos.  But when I looked at this one my jaw dropped.  I saw these 9 very clear dots of light that appeared to be near the path of the rocket. 

 I checked the photos after that one and the dots didn't appear.

We all looked at each other afterwards in disbelief of what we had just observed.  The object never made a sound - which was weird considering the elevation and speed.  I was 19 at the time.  

Since then, I went on to serve as an M1-A1 Main Battle Tank Armor Crewmember, Air & Missile Defense Officer, Military Intelligence Officer, and as a Counterintelligence (CI) Special Agent - retiring as a Captain, after serving the first part of my career as an enlisted Soldier.","Retired Military",2,1,"egg",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1994,1990,2,4,14,"Afternoon","South",0,1,0,0,0

At first, I thought it was a new street light but then realized it was in the sky.  

It was traveling diagonally and seemed to be moving slowly.  

I started to record a video on my phone as it maintained its trajectory.  I thought it must be a drone, so I stopped recording.  As soon as I did, it then split into 3 lights that were lined up horizontally for a second.  There was the original large orangish color light, a small blue light and a white blinking light.  

The blue light then disappeared and the blinking light followed further behind the larger light at the same trajectory.  I started to record again after it split but not for too long. I got freaked out and ran home!  

I also noticed a noise that is hard to describe.  It was almost like a low pitched hum.


((ADDENDUM FROM A VISITOR TO OUR WEBSITE))

Peter,

What the witness observed in Nipomo, CA, was an unarmed Minuteman III missile launched from VAFB.  It was launched at 11:01 pm.  The flashing light seen following was the tumbling first stage. 

A friend took this picture which shows the main missile and the booster behind.  This picture was taken from Shell Beach, CA, and would have been visible from San Luis Obispo, CA, as well.

((anonymous report))","On this day, my father had came to pick me up n go hunting at a buddy of ours place.  Now my dad & I where very close we used to like to smoke herb before we got into the woods to just relax n enjoy things.  We where smoking & just turned into our friends old dirt road at about 530 PM when I'd noticed the side n front windows of my dads old truck appeared to be tinted a really dark color.  So I asked him, pops when did you tinted your windows on here ? He might of thought me crazy but he looked at his side window n scuffed the he started staring out n up the front window n said I didnt tint it .  So we both kinda was like God damn how good is this weed we're smoking!  Anyway we started looking out the front window that was at this time a very very dark purple were looking up at the sky and it's just all lit up these pinkish purple hue colors.  Neither of us had a clue at the time wtf was going on .  We where still driving down this old narrow dirt road but rt ! at the tree top level all we could see was this odd colored light.  My dad speeds up trying to get out from under whatever it is but that was a no go.  So I tell him stop to pull over so he does , we step out of the truck to get a better look n that's when things got weird .. we looked up at the top of the trees now these trees are no more than 30 or 40 feet tall that's how close this thing was . We where in shock bc this thing had no identifiable shape to it & it was about as large as a football field that  emitted this pink/purple light all the way around it that seemed to be constantly fluid ( that's what it reminded me of was a fluid movement) but like I said it was huge but made no sound whatsoever anything that big n close moving should make a sound or upset the atmosphere around it but no.  While we where standing under it everything seemed kinda distorted or something idk.  But things ( us ) where not moving in a normal frame of ref.  I'm guessing we where rt there u! nder this thing for about 30 min watching it but I'm not sure ! .  Like I said nothing was normal at the time .  So my dad kinda freaks and jumps back into the truck n we take off to our friends place but this thing was rt over the top of us the entire time .  We parked at our buddy's and this thing then proceeded to slowly very slowly creep across this farm field in the adjacent lot . I told you this thing was huge n never made a sound as it moved .  Now my dad &I are still standing out side watching this thing our friend is standing in his front door looking out at us n this thing moving across the field . It was slow when it made it across the field it just sit or hovered there for a few min same as it did to us , then out of the bottom left quadrant of this thing it shots out something toward the ground that looked like a missile to me but it never made a impact or sound when it hit so idk .  But then this thing started to move again slowly (now when this thing took off it was gone (poof ) no sound no nothing . My dad & I where just in a stupor! our friend in his front door was asking us wtf is that thing ? We didnt know what to say what could we say wo sounding crazy af?  Anyway my pops refused to even talk about for long time after that even to me & I was with him .  I'm only reporting this now bc I'm getting old & wanna get this off my chest my dad & our friend have since passed away and it's just me now .  Idk maybe someone out there can  relate or have had the same experience maybe it can help them I hope so .  Anyway ty for your time .  M

It was the winter of 1976-1977, I was traveling south on Interstate I15 at approximately 0200 hours, in rural Montana, north of the town of Dutton.  I was a member of Minuteman Maintenance team, returning to our base at Great Falls, Montana, after completing diagnostic systems work and returning a missile to launch ready state.

My team chief, an Air Force officer, and our security guard, were asleep, while I drove after a long dispatch.  I became aware of three points of red lights, in a triangular shape, that was visible just below the roof line of the truck windshield.  I had no idea what it was, and continued to keep an eye on it.  Its relative position never changed over a period of approximately ten minutes or more.

My team chief woke up, and asked what I was looking at.  I directed his gaze to the lights, and told them I had been observing them for some time, and that they seemed to be keeping pace with us.  We continued to watch for another five minutes, while theorizing what they were.

My officer, formerly an Air Force pilot, pointed out the light configuration was not anything he encountered in aviation.  We continued this discussion as we watched, and suddenly the lights made a 90 degree turn and left in a slight blur of red light.  It was incredibly fast.

My officer and I then discussed whether or not to report it.  He was aware of pilots who made reports of unidentified objects being subject to ridicule, harassment and obstacles to career advancement.  We were both subject to the Human Reliability Program, and could have our security clearances pulled as a result.

My husband and I have not been able to find a report from anyone else that is similar to what we experienced.  I'm posting in the hopes that someone will come forward.

I don't have an exact date, by it was fall of 2017.  We we're driving home to Montana in the wee hours of the morning (2 am) and were on the north bank of Lake Pend d'Orielle between Sandpoint and Trestle Creek, closer to the latter.  We enjoy rockhounding and there is supposedly a popular site just off the highway through there, and even though it was 2am we decided to try and find this spot.  We've hounded/navigated with flashlights many times and we were armed.  We find what we thought was the correct pull off, get our gear together, and start hiking, despite heavy rain.  Foolish, yes, but that's besides the point.  The country is very steep, with lots of rock ledges and outcroppings, and pretty thick with vegetation, so the going is slow and careful.  We had been hiking for about 15 minutes and had a view of the Lake and our truck in the turnoff below us when we see an officer pull in and light up our vehicle.  We had been keeping our lights aimed low and pointed away from the road and lake so as not to alarm people down below.  Anyway, the officer was at our vehicle for about 10 minutes while we stood in the dark watching, curious.  He leaves, turns around and does another drive by several times, even turning on his spotlight at one point.  At this point, I assume he is concerned that we are broke down and out walking in rain in a pretty isolated area.  Curiously, he never lights up or seems to search the other side of the road, only the side we were on.  My husband and I are reluctant to come down considering the effort it required to get as far as we had but we're discussing it when the officer apparently satisfied we aren't in the area, fails to come past again.  We turn on our flashlights and briefly shine them down towards the empty highway and lake, looking at the terrain we had scrambled up.

Now, this next part happens so fast, a couple seconds at the most and probably less then even one second, that it is only from discussing and writing down the event a few days later that I am able to provide as many details as I am now.  We switch our lights to red light mode (less visible) at more or less the same time and haven't even finished turning back towards the mountain when we hear a projectile of some sort come from all the way across the lake, pass just over and between our heads, then up the side of the mountain and gone.  This projectile was moving much faster than we thought possible.  We are both experienced firearm users and this was not a bullet.  It was larger, faster, and there was no sound of a weapon being fired.  At all.  Nor was there an echo of any sort, which given the location there should have been.  Even our  voices echoed.  The only sound we heard was the air around it moving as the object came across the lake and over the mountain.  It was about as loud! as you'd hear if a hard flung ball or rock barely missed your head as it went by but different in pitch.  There was no light.  Additionally, had it been anything man made or nature caused coming at us like that, there is no way it wouldn't have smacked into the cliff directly behind us or into any of the trees or rocks above us.  It was only a couple feet above our heads and the terrain was very steep and very thick in addition to it's speed.  Its just not possible.  We actually heard/sensed it maneuver, with intent, through the canyon and then the trees as it went.  My husband actually dropped to the ground in self preservation, while I, trying to process what that could have been but knowing it wasn't anything I'd had experience with, stood there in shock.  His flashlight had turned off completely and mine had changed to strobe mode which I had trouble turning off.  We crouched there for a couple minutes not saying much except what the hell just happened before deciding to abandon ship (pun intended) and get off that mountain.  We knew we h! ad to tu rn our lights back on in order to do so safely despite our fear.  Being him, he all the sudden says ""screw it!"", turns his light on the brightest setting it has (way bright too) and starts heading down with a purpose and in quick fashion.  I followed using my light sparingly but not in red mode.  We make it down in one piece and get on our way. When we got in the truck we checked the time and got mad chills- it was still only 2am give or take a few minutes.

Two days later we decided to write down everything about it that we could, plausible or not, and compare.  There were no discrepancies.  In fact, the similarities on some things are eerie.  Such as we both felt rather then saw that the mass of the object was about the size of a basketball but much more streamlined.  It had energy within it, for lack of better words. It had intelligence.  We both felt that it could have taken our heads off if that was its intent, but had instead given us a warning.  There are other things but you get the jist.

The phones we had at the time began to malfunction and glitch out and had to be replaced soon after, same as the flashlights we carried that night.

Being Christian's and not into such things as UFO's, the paranormal, or supernatural, we are hesitant to put such a label on what happened.  But that's our story, make of it what you will.

Myself and my mother her sister and daughter was watching tv waiting for the news to come on, at 2200 hrs watching wffa channel 8 news the reporter said, ""Folks, if you want to see something amazing go out side and look over the Dallas skyline"" which we did as well as most of the block.

What we all saw was three objects looked like the size of a golf balls from about 9 miles from Dallas texas looking east.  At about a 1000 to 1500 feet above Dallas.  These objects was stationery each emitting different colors like blue gold red green silver.  It was rather superb looking.  After just standing there for about a minute each one started to do bizzar monuvers like one was zigzaging the other one was going up then down zipping from on side of the sky back and forth with the other two, at on point they formed a close circle and went spinning around at very fast speed.

This lasted for about 3 min.  When the US Navy put a halt to the airshow as they scrambled two F-8 crusaders which at that time was hot alert aircraft, which ment they was armed with the sidewinder missile, along with the 50.cal guns.  They flew from NAS Hensley field out side of Dallas on the southwest just about 6 miles away, it only took about 20 seconds from the time they took off to get  over Dallas.  (I seen them as they left the air station only 3 miles away) never will forget how loud they was in full afterburner,  Just before they got on station, the three objects shot straight up in the night sky in a split second.  The F-8s made a few passes over Dallas before returning to there base.

This left me with a impression that the ufos wanted to show the people what they could do, I know aircraft and it was nothing  that any aircraft or helicopter could do.

I went outside for a smoke and just happened to look up and I saw roughly 25 to 35 objects that looked like lights. The lights were heading to the East.

 The lights were in a string or line formation. This formation appeared to be heavily clustered near the start of the formation, and the end of the formation.

 The objects in the middle of the formation were not as clustered (more space between)but were still in a straight line and it appeared that they were able to keep perfect distance to each other.

 I did not hear any sounds which I though odd. I would have to say that the lights appeared to be slightly lower then the actual stars. The color of the light appear to be white/sightly yellow. I have never seen anything like this and thought it could be drones or missiles.

We live atop a large hill with views of Sedona to the left and old salt mines facing us.  We suddenly saw 1, than 3 than 6 total gleaming chevron shaped objects.  I am a former Navy pilot and have never seen a military aircraft or formation like this.  They kept grouping in a circle then rapidly gathered closely together only to spread out again repeatedly.  This lasted about an hour than they simply disappeared at the same time in a flash.  The weird clouds than the UFO's left us feeling very unsettled.

This is not an air sighting. I was a member of a group of AFROTC visiting group to Eglin AFB in 1978.  This group consisted of ten cadets (six under contract to the USAF including myself) and a Lt. Col., our advisor.  During our visit we were touring the base in a USAF bus, much like an old school bus painted a blue/gray.

We were trans-versing the flightline between many large hangers, mostly closed.  We came to a stop at a crossroads stop sign.  I happened to look to our left into an open hanger and saw a saucer-shaped craft approx. 30 feet across with a central dome.  The craft stood on three spindly legs that did not look capable of holding up such a large craft.  There were USAF markings on the upper portion, much like fixed-winged aircraft.

I called it to the attention of others, five were pretty close friends.  Several took snapshot pictures of the craft.  The officer with us definitely saw the craft as well.  We observed the craft for at least four minutes, till the bus moved past the stop sign.

Within 50 feet, our bus was surrounded by AF Security Police, in full combat gear, in jeeps and trucks.  The officers entered our bus and took everyone's cameras and removed the film on the spot!  We were hustled the bus into a nearby hanger serving as offices.  We were officially debriefed and sworn to secrecy under threats of prison for revealing anything about what we had observed in the hanger, then released.  These people were dead serious.

Most of us continued our careers into the Air Force, myself into the Security Police, and others became pilots and missile men.  The officer with us became a Congressman after retiring from the military.

When we realized it was flying upwards and towards the East, it flew behind a tree.  We ran across my yard to get better perspective.  When we found the object in the sky again, it had risen and appeared as a if it were riding along the Earth's outer atmosphere.

I had recently started star gazing often at night because of a high occurrence of shooting stars in the area and sometimes in the early morning hours I would see satellites or space debris reflecting through the air.  Recently Trump had threatened his nuclear weapon button was bigger in response to North Korea Nuclear tension via Twitter so my assumption for a while for what I had viewed that night was it was a defense test or Space-X Rocket Launch from the Brownsville, TX, location.  I did not report this incident initially, as coming from a military family and having been educated in Mechanical Engineering, I assumed what I saw was a missile defense deflection test in preparation for any foreign nuclear attack.

I walked outside and looked around the sky trying to allow my eyes to adjust to the darkness which would allow me to see stars and satellites easier as sometimes being next to a larger city the stars can be harder to locate.  The night sky was clear enough from cloud coverage for me to be able to locate stars in any direction.  About 2 minutes after being outside I noticed a group of 3 stars around 72 degrees east that were brighter than when my head had panned that direction previously.  Now visually fixated on these objects, I noticed that the objects were tracking NE in regards to my position and phone compass.  Being the large pessimist I am, I tried to downplay what I was seeing and assumed them to be air planes of some type.  But there were no strobe lights or jet sounds so I thought these to be space debris for a moment.  As a few seconds go by, I realize that it seems as if these equidistant 3 white orb objects are traveling in triangle formation.  There roughly at abou! t 35 degrees upwards in relation to my point of view.  Only about 10 or 15 seconds into the ordeal I made a split second decision not to go grab my phone (stupid) in a selfish act to keep watching the event unfold as I had never seen anything like this before but being someone well versed in mathematics and engineering was convincing myself with logical thinking what I was seeing was nothing to be excited about.  Calmly, I watched at about 45 seconds into the entire event as a middle orb seemed to appear out of thin air.  The objects began to track back towards the eastward direction slowly but changing directions simultaneously with each other moments after the arrival of the new orb.  Remaining equidistant to the new object the three whitish orbs slowly started de-accelerating to a full stop in coordination with the new orb the air.  Levitating there for a few more moments as the event reached the 1 minute mark.  The original 3 orb objects at this time started moving around as i! f they were trying to push this new orb that appeared by directing themselves underneath the new orb.  The original orbs were starting to move around the new orb erratically unlike anything I have ever seen before. Zig Zag patterns is the best description but staying equidistant from the new orb object.  At this time I noticed strobe lights of airplanes coming from a local air force base heading towards the objects coming from the Southeast direction at 116 degrees.  As the jets made it to around 75 degree east track the new orb surrounded by the original moving orbs started to glow orange slowly.  Over a period of 20 seconds the new orb grew to be larger and larger and seemed to gain luminosity as bright as the sun in the night sky but only in that area of the sky.  It looked like an atmospheric re-entry of a large object but the other objects around it seemed to speed up during this process.  The orb toward the right of formation shot off faster than I have ever seen anything travel in my entire life.  It covered around 6 inches of sky in less than! a 1 second span.  I assumed this object was traveling mach 5 or 6 but there was no explosion or sounds.  All I could hear were the jets at this time that were now approaching it within my range of view and most definitely theirs.  It was obvious these jets were tracking these objects.  The orb that traveled away from the formation went like a chord through a circle in regards to my visible atmosphere.  In less mathematical descriptive terms, the object was like if you were to have shot a bullet through the top portion of an orange.  The object was moving so fast it almost looked as a shooting star would have in regards to speed but this object was more gathered and had no comet tail or sparks.  The new glowing orb faded and each orb slowly one by one flickered/disappeared from plain site.  Whether these objects just traveled beyond the atmosphere slowly or not..they just vanished.

After not being able to confirm that there was a space x launch and others in the area reported seeing the same thing I took it upon myself to report it.  As a credible witness soon to earn a degree in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in both Mathematics and Psychology? What I saw is definitely artificial. I would assume at this time it is advanced defensive or just raw technology possessed by the United States Government being it was so closely after the nuclear arms arguments.  This is why I did not report it for a while but now I realize if it is an adversary that has the technology.  These objects are being reported around US military bases frequently.  Reports like this might be useful into tracking the origin.  Regardless of my opinions..it does not change the visual event that occurred.  So I decided to come forward with the report even though people usually are shunned for this type of thing.","Student",1,4,"formation",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2019,2010,1,1,23,"Night","South",0,1,0,0,0

My partner and I were attending tonight?s regular Full Moon Fire Jam on the beach along with a hundred or so other people.  My partner made a comment about the planes tonight, she felt like they were moving a lot lower and faster, they seemed more colorful than usual and were interesting to look at so I was laying on our blanket face up staring at the planes in the sky.  

After a while of spacing out I realized my attention had fixed on a bright object that wasn?t the moon.  At first it was just a bright red-orange light headed towards earth from the East, if the projectile landed it would be a little bit North of us.  After a minute I asked ?Do you see that??.  

We watched it for another minute, trying to understand what it was. My original thought was a foreign space object somehow missing a tail, but my partner?s was that it was a bomb.  She has better eyesight than me and later claimed that the thought of it being a bomb came from the way the light shone against! the surface of the object, like wrapping around its nose, ?It looked like a bullet.?.  It was big, how big is hard to say, but big enough that if it did crash to earth it would destroy the city.  

We got up and started to leave, but when no one else followed we questioned our decision.  ?It?s still there.?  I noted, and we both watched it for a few more seconds.  From my perspective it seemed to stop and immediately change directions, now moving parallel to the horizon towards the North, away from us, but my partner believes it ?slungshot back the way it came?.  It was completely gone within a second.  

I posted a vague question about it on the Fire Jam Facebook event page and two others described the event as well.  I don?t know if what I saw was intelligent life, technology, or space junk, but whatever it was, it made my heart fall into my stomach, I could hardly believe what I was seeing was real.  I feared for my life.","Diagnostic & Testing Specialist",4,1,"egg",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2019,2010,3,7,21,"Evening","Midwest",0,1,0,0,0

At the time of 19:56 near the city hall of Victorville, CA, a friend of mine and I were inside my truck facing the South-East direction as we waited at a stop sign to proceed on to the main road.  As I first came to the stop sign, I noticed an extremely bright metallic looking sphere in the sky that flew across at speeds much faster than the speed of any aircraft or missile that I have ever seen or heard of.  Its height was around 2,000 to 4,000 feet above ground and from checking 2k quality surveillance footage of our property camera that faced to the West.  I determined that the object did not come from behind me and perhaps from above me.  It flew to the East which was the direction I was facing at that high speed and then after nearing the 15 freeway a few miles out it began to dive at a forty-five degree angle at half of its previous speed until it was a thousand feet or less above ground and it nearly came to a full stop just outside of our view in which a large building was in the way of our line of sight.  As we drove past the building to get a better view, it flew away travelling at its top speed in the South-East direction.  The object was by far the brightest object in the sky shining a white/grey absolute metallic looking shine as if it was reflecting the sun.  At that time of day, the sun has just set behind the nearby mountains and was hardly visible at all.  The sky was mostly clear and there was still near full daylight outside.  As the IT tech for the large facility in which I work at here, I went back and searched all of the surveillance footage from dozens of high definition cameras, but sadly all except for one camera was aimed high enough to view at the sky which was the North-West facing camera which is the one I used to see if the object came from behind my location.  My roommate who was a Marine and I have never seen anything like that object online or from any other media source.  I can only wish that one of our cameras had caught that occurrence, the object was so vivid an! d pronounced that it would have spoken for itself on video as it was the brightest object I have ever seen in the sky other than the sun itself.  What is also interesting is that this occurred one day after the night a double meteor storm (Southern delta Aquariids/alpha Capricornids) was to be the most active.

Was in my work vehicle heading south on us-42 when I noticed a silver object in the sky that appeared to resemble an airplane.  I then paid no attention to it until I was on the exit ramp from 42 to u.s. 35 East.  I glanced up at it and examined it a little further, I then noticed it hadn't moved anywhere for at least 30 seconds.  Upon further examination I noticed that I could see the nose of the object it was not conical it was round.  I then noticed that the area at the rear of the object was not tail shaped but had a black point that protruded in the opposite direction of the nose.  The sky was extremely clear at this moment I could see no other objects in the vicinity for referencpe.  This craft or object was at approximately 5000 feet altitude.  The object did not move if it did move then it moves slowly in relation to my vehicle traveling 65 miles per hour.  Unlike the speed of an airplane which exceeds the speed of a vehicle when the perspective is from the ! vehicle.  About a half mile down from the exit on 35, I then exited off the highway onto lower bellbrook road.  At this time I was not in sight of the object and was anxious to get around the curve of the exit ramp so that I could get another look at it by then I was pulling my phone out to take a picture.  Once I came to a stop sign I glanced back up in the sky where the object had been and it was no longer there.  It being an extremely clear sky I looked and looked for the object again.   There was absolutely nothing in the sky any longer.

We went outside to check it out because it seemed particularly low and loud, and it was maybe half mile or so above the ground, Using radar or something in the nose we could see the green light.  It was flying west to east at full speed as far as we could tell.  Once it got almost directly overhead, maybe 20 degrees straight in front of us, we noticed a light orb turn on, orange in color, about 200 to 300 feet in front of the helicopter get bright and then take off in front of the helicopter.  The orb was right on top of us again about a half mile up.  It took off East and then veered Northeast.  The helicopter sped up a little bit and went in pursuit.

On October 30th 2001, while at work, my boss told me he heard on the radio that it was the first full moon on Halloween in 80 years which I found that to be interesting.  I was done with work at 9:30 PM  and waited for my co-worker, as she was my ride home that night.  It was about 9:45 PM when we exited the building facing east.  After about 10-15 steps out I remembered what my boss said and looked up to appreciate the moon the day before it was full. When I did, my stomach immediately sank and I stopped dead in my tracks.  My immediate impression of it was that it was a missile or rocket coming straight down (this was fairly soon after 9/11 and anxiety was still high).  But as my mind began to register what my eyes were seeing, I noticed that it had no exhaust or visible emissions, no lights or sounds and it was not traveling downward but growing downward, the top portion of it remained fixed in the sky.  All I could do was raise my arm at first to motion my co! -worker to stop walking (she hadn't yet noticed).  My eyes glued to this thing I finally muster out ""what is that? What is that? Look!"" She stops walking and I now have her attention and point to the moon. ""Do you see that? What is that? Do you see this? What is that?"" There was a slight haze but it was clear out at the time and this object was solid. It casted a faint shadow from the moonlight, it was physically there in the sky. I would best describe it as a very thin black rectangle or a thick black line in plain sight in front of the full moon. It was growing downward and looked like a solid banner slowly unraveling. We were standing there in complete awe and silence, just watching it. It then stopped ""unraveling"" (still in front of the moon) and right after it did, another line or thin rectangle appeared a little below where the first object ended and did the same ""unraveling"" the first object did. All the while maintaining a stat! ionary point of origin from where it appeared. So at first it ! started to look like exclamation point (!) But the point continued to elongate downward. The objects did not move other than appearing and ""unraveling"" the entire time. The moon was well above the tree line and no power poles or clouds were even close to it. I did not see any other aircraft in the sky. As the 2nd object started to stretch past the bottom of the moon. My coworker started to become very unsettled and distraught over what we were watching and needed to get home to her family asap. She was so shaken up from it that she asked me if I could drive her car for her. I wanted to stay and watch it, as long as I could but I couldn't deny my coworkers request to drive, seeing how shook up she got.  Driving home, I tried to continue watching it the best I could but soon lost sight of it in the trees and hills on the way home. Once home I was able to get a good view of the moon again but when I did, I didn't see the objects any more. We must have watched the objects for ! about 5-10 mins before leaving the work parking lot and about 10 to 15 mins to dive myself home. I was so excited at the time over what I saw that I wrote down some notes and drew a diagram to help better describe and understand what happened once I got home. I scoured local news for days but never heard anything about it. I told my friends and family, who were skeptical and made light of it.  Some of my friends later got confirmation from my coworker of what we saw that night. But it still scares her and she doesn't like to talk about it in detail. Although some time has passed since then, I still remember this event very vividly, as I have never seen anything like it before or since. I have since stopped telling people about it out of fear of ridicule, discrediting myself and disbelief (even I am skeptical of other people's ufo stories and sightings). I've only recently came across my notes of what I witnessed that night and wanted to tell my story one more time. I do not! know what these things are but I am certain what I saw. They ! were sol id and they were there in front of the moon. They made no noise and had no lights. They sat motionless in the sky and changed its shape. I witnessed the 2nd object literally appear and grow from nothing. I am an educated person and I cannot come to a proper explanation of what it was. It really defied my logic. I know about helicopters, meteors, contrails, chemtrails and weather balloons. I am aware of various, bizarre weather phenomena. Drones have not yet been made public. I rarely drink and I don't take drugs. I was of sound mind on that night and I am of sound mind now as I write this.

It curved through the sky smoothly, not pushed by the wind but going pretty fast, until it shrunk into a single spherical dot shining through the blue at us. Finally it was out of sight.

I?ve observed this craft for almost two weeks and I?m not entirely sure what it is.  It might be a drone or a UFO, but it is certainly not an airplane, helicopter, or satellite because its movement patterns conflict with aerodynamic animations typical in planes and helicopters and it?s too fluid to be a satellite.  The craft exhibits sporadic unidirectional movements without the buffering process of reorientation.  For example, this vehicle can change directions without backing up or turning around.  Additionally, it?s capable of hovering in the air for hours, or speeding (however, I?ve never observed any brisk movements, it mostly hovers around the same region for hours) which is uncharacteristic of planes and helicopters, but not drones (depending on the type, if it is a drone it?s incredibly expensive).  The vehicle in question emerges exclusively during the evening, roughly between 12 AM and 3 AM, and lingers for three to five hours.  Maybe it stays longer, bu! t I?ve never managed to stay up long enough to witness it.

 The craft possesses white lights, which amplify in certain contexts. For example, an almost indiscernible second craft approached the hovering, distinguishable vehicle and both brightened when in close proximity of each other.  The indistinguishable craft immediately disappeared after, following with a bright projectile shooting from the sky.  Firstly, I couldn?t tell if the amplified lights were strobe lights or solid lights, and what I?m describing might indicate drone collision lights.  I researched drone collision lights and they?re functional during the full extent of drone-operation.  Sensor-activated collision lights sound perfectly plausible, but I?m struggling to find any examples. Secondly, the bright projectile resembled a ?shooting star? and it?s not the first time I?ve seen these ?shooting stars? projected from/around this vehicle. However, correlation does not equal causation and they may be unrelated. Another detail to add, however, is that two distinct light proj! ectiles *appeared* to shoot from the isolated craft in a separate occurrence. But, I?ve only witnessed two occurrences of light projectiles coinciding with the craft, so I?m guessing it?s just a regular meteor. I am in no way assigning any definitive explanation because there?s a lot I don?t know. Do what you will and feel free to ask any questions.","Broke ass college student",1,2,"light",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2019,2010,4,12,2,"Night","West",0,1,0,1,0

I pulled over into an empty lot and started watching. That is when I noticed it was a pattern of lights traveling in this angle. As one Began to burn brightly above the tree line out of no where and start going up, the one before it would get lighter, the one  before that would get dimmer, and the last would burn out. My daughter stepped out from the van to see what dad was watching and started yelling, ""what is that?"" All I could say with disbelief was, ""I don't know... I don't know""   We watched as this pattern continued for 30 seconds or more. I tried to take film, but my phone would not get a clear shot because of the street lights. It almost looked like it could be a large spinning object because the lights would just start in the atmosphere and move from south west to north west in that same angle 20 feet above the tree line. the objects were not rising from earth, but starting in the sky and ending in the upper part of the sky line. The pattern would start left and go right. and when the last Light started up, it was a bigger and brighter golden ball then the others and took longer to fade out as it went from south west to north west in night sky. it was just amazing to watch these lights start glowing out of no where and move left to right. I have included a picture I put together of what we saw and in the horizon area we watched it. best part was my daughter was able to witness this too.

What I first saw it as  was either a drone or a missile. But it couldn't have been a drone since it was the size of a planet. The objects seem to be going in a 45 degree angle as I was facing  west. A shooting light of objects that seemed to ba a bright glow with a fade off of blue.

  They seemed to keep coming one to two seconds after each other. There seemed to be about 12 to 15 objects. They seem to have the same lighting as a roman candle. But started from the middle of the sky. They almost seemed to be a rotating item. They all seemed to be traveling in a straight line and just fade off.

At approximately 1930 on December 22, 2019, I was sitting in the hot tub outdoors enjoying the winter weather and the bright, clear sky over Michigan. I had just asked my children which star they thought was the brightest in the sky, and as I looked west, I noticed at least four bright lights traveling in serial across the sky, fading as they traveled further as if disappearing into the distance. They were traveling in a straight line, appearing perfectly spaced from one another and traveling along the same exact path. As they traveled further and began to disappear one at a time, new lights continued to appear from over the tree line until at least 10 of them had traveled along the same exact path and disappeared. The lights had the same appearance as stars, but shone much brighter and were obviously far closer. They did not move like, or appear to be, airplanes.

 Based on experiences I had in the military, my initial impression was that these might have been missiles or rockets being test-fired over Lake Michigan from a launch point somewhere in West Michigan ? possibly near the area of St Joseph based on where they appeared to be coming from. However, I am unaware of any launch or test sites in this area.

On Monday January 6th, my son and I were about to walk into the gym around 5:15 pm, when we saw what we thought at first was a rocket or missile launch. The object was tiny and I couldn't discern it's shape other than triangle looking with a red light on it. It came from due west and curved toward north. There were some high clouds at the time and the object was above them flying extremely rapidly, leaving a contrail. We both felt kind of nervous because of the issues with Iran and wondered if we had seen a missile launch. We live in a flyway for different military aircraft, police, traffic enforcement radar, first responders, fire fighting craft, news helicopters, commercial flights, private aircraft, and so on, in a north-south pattern mostly.  We've seen a number of rocket launches come from Vandenberg AFB, where you can see the fan like spray of the rocket's contrail and watch it move across the sky.  They move from north-west to south. This was also very ! different than other aircraft or rockets we've seen, not only because of the direction it traveled, but due to the speed in which it was moving. I can watch a jet, up at cruising speed and likely around 36,000 feet, move across the sky from horizon to horizon in about 3 minutes. This craft went across our field of vision, and just before it reached the eastern horizon, it traveled up and out of sight, taking less than a minute.

t walking the dog with my daughter at about 8 PM when we noticed a light moving across the sky.

On 19th April 2020 at about 6.40 PM, we had seen a strange moving object in sky (towards west) it was definitely not an aircraft since it is lock down in India due to corona virus.

It cannot be a rocket as it is moving from left horizon to right (South to North); not upwards.

 The total length almost seems like more than 2 meter including what i believe is a tail, and the length remained constant all the way till it disappeared in cloud.

 It seemed like a missile but we were not expecting any thing like that since there is no report of an experiment and we are in middle of a pandemic crisis.

i am filing this on behalf of a deceased friend who confided in me before his death.  Sometime in spring/summer 1966 he was an MP at Loring AFB.  He was on patrol with another MP and they were at the top of a hill when 3 orange glowing spheres he estimated about 50 feet wide and same in height passed over the base in formation about 30 mph.  They followed the spheres until they passed out of view from their jeep.  Later that day he was friends with a fighter pilot on the base.  The fighter confided that fighters had been scrambled armed with missiles to chase the objects.  The pilots tracked the spheres into Greenland where they then shot up at unimaginable speed at a sharp 90 degree angle and out of view in the blink of an eye.  The pilot told my friend who was 18 at the time that the pilots were briefed not to mention anything and forced to sign secrecy agreements.  I am leaving his name in the contact section.  No sounds or exhaust were observed from the spheres and ! no aggressive actions.","military police",8,3,"orb",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1966,1960,2,6,21,"Evening","Northeast",0,1,0,0,0

I live on a subdivision thruway.

My son-in-law and his best friend and I had just loaded U-Haul of my daughter's stuff to go to Georgia were her family was stationed with the Army.

Lambert Airport was about 8 miles away as the crow flies. At that time you could watch the planes lining up for landing in a cake pan pattern. So you could view  the planes circling St. LOUIS getting ready to land. Not any more because the trees have 40 years tree growth.

Anyway, as we finished loading and drinking a beer a fleet of three groups of UFOs flew to the right of us in the Western sky about 2000 feet off the deck going hundreds of miles an hour with a black cloud behind them.

They were V shaped. With two sided bright orange lights in a classic flock pattern.

The cars in the street stopped on a dime and the occupants got out.

The airport lit up like a Vesuvious Fountain. Our National Guard Unit filled the skies with every F 15 they had.

They chased the fleet on a NNE glide path.

 During those days I had a delivery route that encompassed the Airport.

I used to watch the F 15 s takeoff.

They used to take off Hot.

They used minimum runway. Then they pulled to a 90?straight up position while doing a 360? spiral. Then they would fall on their back and seem to fall in the direction they wanted to go. Like a left turn.

Then they would do a 180?to straighten out. Very impressive to see that is what those F 15 s did that night.

One other aside. The best friend of my son-in-law was pretty shook up.

He was Navy.

He turned to me and said, I should not say this to you. I have seen a bunch of classified stuff. At sea we have shot a lot of missiles off at the Korean Peninsula and sent a lot of jets in war games.

I have seen a lot. I have never seen anything like this.

The next day the radio reported that a Russion sattelite flew over St. LOUIS and landed in Oklahoma.

That is exactly the opposite direction of this event.

On Sunday, May 24, 2020, I was out running in the early morning in a rural area of Southern Indiana.  It was a clear, crisp morning with bright blue, cloudless skies.  At approximately 7:30 a.m., I witnessed an object with a small drone like body flash across the sky from west to east at missile like speed.

 The drone like body was whitish in color with an electric blue to aqua colored ?headlight- like? light in the front.  I thought this was unusual as I would normally expect a power source of something flying so fast to be in the rear of the object and not in the front, if in fact it was the power source.  The overall size of the object was surprisingly small with the bluish light by far being more visible than the body.

 I estimate the angle of elevation to have been approximately 45 ? 50 degrees.  The object was flying at a surprisingly low level in the sky.  It was easy to see this because additionally there were two cargo or passenger planes flying much, much higher in the sky.  I was extremely taken with the speed at which the object was moving as well.  I estimate that it was only in my eyesight for 2 to 3 seconds.

 I had never seen anything move that fast and it made me want to check on the news to see if anything had happened as well as file this report.  It reminded me of something from the movies flying at an exaggerated rate of speed.  I speculated that it might be something military in nature.  It did not make me think ?aliens,? but who knows.  In conclusion, I never expected to see an unidentified flying object in broad daylight.

I have seen many high-speed low altitude flyovers of military jets, and I learned that the sound is not detected until the plane is overhead.

There were no engine sounds, no thundering afterburners, no loud rushing sound of a military jet.  No doppler change.  It was gone in about 2.5 seconds.

This occurred in during my time in the US Air Force while stationed at Vandenberg AFB, near Lompoc, CA.  I was a member of a geodetic survey squadron that brought highly accurate geodetic, astronomic data to icbm silos, and other assets (SR 71, X 15, down range splash downs, etc) of the USAF, at VAFB, Edwards AFB, and Eniwetok.  We usually worked in teams of three individuals.  One person was an observer who actually made the measurements off the north star and triangle or quadrangle survey network at each missile silo.  A second person is the recorder.  The recorder simply documents the 16 measurements and time lapse of each for each station run.  The third person usually was backup for either position and also made sure the target lights on each station continued turned on.  We did this at VAFB and also for the 18 Titan around Tucson Arizona, and other areas.

 This particular event took place in late 1966 or early 1967 at the far north end of VAFB.  I previously reported it as February 1967, however, frankly, after these years my recollection may be off 2 or 3 months.  I was assigned to VAFB in September or October of 1963 and was honorably discharged in May of 1967.

Since our 1st Order survey measurements required optimal weather conditions, our work was done at night to minimize distortion and parallax by heat waves.  We would leave the Dayroom early evening about 6 or 7 pm.  This would allow us to set up our target lights on each concrete monolith then finally set up our Wild T3 theodolite while there was still enough light.  At dusk we would start our measurements of 16 positions at each of the 3 or 4 survey stations at each icbm silo.  Typically, we would finish one silo site per evening and return to the Dayroom about 10:00 or 10:30 pm.

On the night of question, we were working an icbm silo at the far north end of VAFB near Lospe Mountain.  We were taking astro measurements on the north star, Polaris.  Therefore, please note that we were observing and focused completely toward the north with our backs to the south.   Most of the base and other icbm silos were to our rear, south of us.

We completed our work and returned to the Dayroom.  When we arrived at the office, our Party Chief was waiting for us at the door.  Upon arrival, he immediately asked us whether we had observed what had happened at the silo in question.  We responded that we had not seen anything.  He then told us the Air Police at Headquarters, seeing an apparent ?light show? at that north end silo had at first thought there had been a missile launch.  He said that silo had been lit up as if there had been a launch.  Then, he said, they realized it was not a missile launch.  He said an object had approached that silo from the ocean side low and slow until it was over the silo.  There, he said, it hovered directly over the silo.   The Sgt, while a nice fellow, was no one to kid around or play jokes on anyone.  He was a very serious person who did not play around.

I expected to hear more reports the following morning, however, the next day it was as if nothing had happened.  There was not even a hint of what had happened the previous night.

It was not until many years later in the early 2000s that I heard of the report of a similar event in Montana around that approximate time.  Those two events appear similar in that both involved an unknown object hovering or next to an icbm silo.","Retired (geodetic/astro surveyor), construction management",4,1,"disk",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1967,1960,2,6,22,"Night","West",0,1,0,0,0

On 7/11/2020 and 7/12/2020, my husband and I went to Persimmon Road to watch and investigate a bright white light that has been seen in 3 different positions multiple nights weekly since April 1, 2020.

The first sighting on April 1 was out my bedroom window as I was lying in bed, in the northwest sky appearing over national forest land.  It was by far the brightest light in the sky and at first appeared to be a bright star such as Venus.  But after an hour in bed watching it, close persistent observation showed it to be moving with abrupt changes in direction, circular motions and other erratic movements . It ?sparkled? and seemed to fade in intensity at times.  It would disappear, then reappear nearby.  I took a video holding my phone very still and as zoomed in as it would let me.  Outside, there were no plane or helicopter noises, only silence. I called the nonemergent local Clayton police line to ask whether they had other sightings of a drone or light in the sky that night.  They told me no, but to let me know whether a drone came close to our private property and they would intervene at that point. I was unsure as to why someone would fly a drone in one spot (relatively one spot) for over 2 hours at night, unless they were searching for moonshine stills or something.  I made my husband come look and confirm that it was in fact moving and that it was not Venus. I did not look closer at my video but posted it to Facebook and asked if anyone else had seen it.

After the 3rd or 4th sighting within 1 week, I was watching the barely moving light carefully and the surrounding less bright stars.  Then, about 5 other ?stars? started moving- not nearly as bright or as big as the original- all with separate flight patterns, all with abrupt erratic movements.  They clustered in the sky next to the original and did not stray too far from it, still in the northwest sky.  I got so afraid I had tears in my eyes and slept in my daughter?s bed with her that night. I would not look out my window intentionally for about two or three weeks after that.  I didn?t want to know at that point. My curiosity won out after a while, and I went back to observing, this time casually, before falling asleep each night.  I saw a Facebook post in April from a reporter for an ATL news station that showed a string of lights near ATL that was later attributed to the satellite train.  I wanted to believe this because it was easier that way.  But my light(s) and my experienc! e observing them did not appear consistent with the satellite train, not to mention I looked up the satellites? positioning and course near us- they weren?t nearby.  I asked a friend of mine who?s father is a pilot locally if he knew of any lights; he advised downloading the FlightAware app and checking the area for any registered planes, drones, other craft when I saw it next. I did see many planes with their normal blinking lights in the sky above us reflected clearly on the app; I did not see any nearly stationary crafts within our NE part of the state, nor in NC or in the adjoining towns.

In May and June, the light was present less often and always alone that I could see, but it had changed position drastically- it was in the western sky, very low , so low it appeared to be in the tree line in the woods right beside our house, shining even brighter than before (maybe closer?), still moving so that at times the trees would block it intermittently.  If I looked while lying in my bed, it was shining directly into my eyes but would occasionally dip down (into the National Forest?) and disappear for minutes to half an hour before popping back up again.  My dog barks often at the woods behind our house due to coyote, bears, possum, etc. He seemed to bark nearly constantly on the nights the light showed up behind the house.  Always between 9:30 to 10:00 pm sometimes until 1 AM (still there if I woke up at that time) and always silent.  We went on vacation for about a week for July 4th, and while we were with family, I got out my phone to show my mom my video from ! the first night.  This time, I paused the video and took still frame screen shots of my moving bright white spot- and I figured out that I could zoom in further than before.  And the zoomed in pictures really amazed me (coupled with disbelief that I had not thought to do this before). Frame by frame, split second by split second, the size, shape and color of the light changed, which was what was causing the sparkling and flickering effect from an unfocused distance. I couldn?t believe it. I?ve never seen anything like it, especially the drastic nature of the changes and the range of colors. I got excited (I?m in the medical field, science is exciting anyway for me) and told my husband as soon as we got back, we were going to actually go looking for the source of the light through the trees and track whether it was close or far, and try to get another video and pictures this time. He was not as excited as I was but agreed to drive once I saw it through the trees. But every nig! ht the next week, it was cloudy and/or I didn?t see the light ! in eithe r of its usual position(s). I thought I had missed my chance. My husband stated that the most wide open area of sky near our part of the county was out near the Persimmon Road Fire Station clearing and that we could go there to just see if it was in the sky at all.

We went on 7/11, 2 days ago once it got dark. And low and behold, there it was just over the treeline in the EAST part of the sky, bright white as ever but still appearing like a star to the common observer. I took video with my iPhone, my husband took video with his android phone. No other star or cell tower blinking showed up on my video, only this light. And to my surprise, zoomed in, I saw the light pulsating, sending rings of light-concentric circles- out from the center while enlarging intermittently, then shrinking back down to normal. Like in a cartoon depiction of a boombox speaker blaring with each beat. We got in the car to attempt to track it or localize it in reference to the town of Clayton. We didn?t get much closer but my husband felt that it was pretty low in the sky still. At around midnight, we had a local cop stop and ask if we were ok, since we ended up on a road near the prison. And we decided to go home. I looked at both videos on the way home. ?! Calm down?, my husband said. ?You have to see this, zoomed in!? I said. I started taking still-frame screen shots of the video and zooming in during the video, and the colors, shapes and rate of changing from one configuration to another were startingly beautiful. I took about 30 still frames of a variety of appearances, enlarged them, and posted the video and still shots to facebook because this was INCREDIBLE. I contacted an old friend from the Air Force who had told me he flew over Clayton regularly when he was on duty, to see if he had seen anything or could suggest an etiology. He denied seeing anything and had no idea what it could be.

Why hadn?t we brought out our monocular? I couldn?t find our binoculars, of course. That meant that last night, on 7/12/2020, we had to go watch again, this time before dusk so I could approximate the time it appeared in the sky and perhaps get a picture of it in the daylight of dusk. Nothing until around 9:30 or 35 pm, despite other stars being visible first, including the big dipper in the opposite direction behind us. Then suddenly, the light appeared in a position lower to the tree line than the night prior. It wasn?t there, then it was. The monocular didn?t help much especially since you have to hold it very still in order to see something else moving, and didn?t focus as well as I?d hoped and it gives you a headache after a time. But the light seemed closer tonight and my husband?s video did not disappoint. The video and pictures were the best yet. I will continue to watch and record this light for as long as it shows up, and I?m trying to find someone with a t! elescope.

Examples of the morphology once zoomed in: 1.	Perfectly round, white and densely uniform in color 2.	Round white outer ring with dark or sometimes bright green inner ring.

Yellow and purple nebula like haze with a clearly defined white bullet shape in the center There are so many more given there are at least 4 shape changes for every 1 second of video.

I invite your people to come to Clayton and investigate this, since it seems to be a long term type anomaly. My only worry is that I get too close for comfort to sleep at night, or it (if of intelligent design) figures out it?s being watched and leaves for good.

When I was four or five years old, I was awaken from sleep in what I think was the early morning hours because everyone was asleep and everything was quiet. My mother, brother, and baby sister were living with my great-grandmother and we all shared one bedroom.  My brother and I shared a bed, and across the room, my mother slept with the baby.

 I wouldn't say I woke up; it was more like I was summoned to get up.  I didn't even think to resist and I was not scared.  I slept against the wall, so I had to crawl over the iron bedpost at the foot of the bed so I wouldn't wake up my brother. In my Fruit-of-the-Loom under ware, I went out of the room, through the short hall and dining room, and into the kitchen. There I unlatched the backdoor and stepped out onto the cold concrete steps that led down into the backyard.

 And there, waiting for me, was a giant head hovering over the yard about 10 feet off the ground. It was glowing in a softly wavering greenish color. It did not move, but faced me as I felt compelled to set on the concrete in the darkness. I knew it was not human because the top of it's head was very large in portion to the lower face, like it had a giant brain. It was bald and I saw no hair anywhere. From what I could see through the glow, the small, expressionless face below the massive cranium was human-like but not fleshy soft; more like skin covered skull. It's eyes were all black and it's mouth was no more than a very thin line.

 I was not scared because the head did not want me to feel fear. In fact, I was very calm and very much at ease. There was nothing I could do anyway. And somehow I knew that the head was not physically real, but was a projection of material, and that the real physical thing the head was showing was somewhere else and not just a hovering head.

 Then the head began to send thoughts into my mind without moving it's mouth or changing any features at all. What happened next is very difficult to explain because there are apparent and real factors of time involved.  I'll do my best in bullet form what it showed and communicated:  1. It show me a wide river and dense bunches of fruit trees lined the far bank. And people were in those, but I could not see them. I knew there where there eating the fruit. The head told me that the people there were at the start of my bloodline and that his kind had been watching and guarding my line all the way down to me. It said (expressed) that they were watching over other bloodlines, other families all over the world. It said I would meet some of them when the time is right.

 2. It told me that there is an invisible war going on in humanity and that powerful and evil creatures (their enemies) ruled the world. It said my bloodline and the others were (and I'll say it this way because I can now) at the front edge of human development, that we are the highest level of human development. They made sure that all my generations were matched with the possessor of some pure blood, not mutated. It said my blood was very close to pure as can be in all of humanity.

Because of my background, I?ve lived life with my eyes trained on the sky.

Approximately two months ago while walking from my house to my vehicle.

I looked up briefly and scanned the sky. Taking pause for a moment on a section between a cloud formation, and at A 20- 25,000ft range slightly southwest of my position.

I immediately spotted a single black dot with absolutely no identifiable characteristics. Clearly this wasn?t any conventional aircraft I?m am familiar with.

This dot caught my attention as it moved out from the cloud for 2 seconds, and then reversing course immediately going back into the cloud.

The object continued with this behavior 3 times before a second object of the same size and shape followed it into the adjacent cloud formation. These radical movements simply could not have been accomplished by any aircraft I?m familiar with. The speed with which they moved at that altitude was astonishing.

I did however.

I?ve posted this incident beforehand but I didn?t put much of a description. This time I will explain it to the best of my abilities.

 11:00PM CST  I was 16 when this happened. I had just started my 11th grade year earlier that month. It was a school night that night. I usually go to bed around 8:00 to wake up at 5:40AM. But this night was different in regards to the dream I had and how it affected me. I believe it was sometime around 11:00PM when the ?dream? I had supposedly started. In this supposed dream I am standing in my living room behind my couch looking out of the open blinds in the Southwest corner looking up into the sky above the forest tree line across the street. As I?m looking out of the window I see 3 silver triangles with white pulsing lights on their edges. The where flying in a V formation. The point of the V was flying forward and the other 2 were flying directly behind it practically touching their edges together. As the ?dream? continues I see the formation of pulsing triangles silently and slowly fly over the tree line. As I see them I get immediately freaked out and I say loudly, ?Oh! my God I?m going to be abducted again!?. Then the dream blacks out and I?m suddenly fighting these random people. I?m in some random building. It looked like an lobby for a mechanic shop. I was holding a revolver and running up to a man that was in the lobby area. As I run up I slide down to one knee, and aim straight at this random mans forehead. The mans face looked like he had a beard. He was also wearing a black leather duster of some sort. He was wearing a beige shirt underneath the duster. He was wearing jeans, and also boots. As I?m sliding up to him and aiming at his forehead he is also aiming back at me. I shoot at him. He falls down dead. Behind the man there were two black plastic chairs with a glass table in between. On the table there were bullets. I stay on one knee and reload the revolver. I run out the door of the lobby to the outside. Outside there was a dirt road. Across the street from the supposed mechanics shop is a red wooden building. It looked like ! a vehicle shed for farm equipment. On the wall of vehicle shed! there i s a door. From that same door comes out a guy that looks somewhat similar to the first guy I shot. I shoot him in the knee as he?s rushing out. He falls forward. Behind me from the same direction where the mechanics shop is an older woman, maybe 50 is running up to me. She had longer hair in a braided ponytail that was grey. Ah was wearing a red plaid button up, jeans and boots. She was holding what looked like a broom handle with 3 little blades sticking out the front. As she?s coming up behind me I turn around and disarm her and I get ready to stab her with this bladed broom handle. As I?m just about to stab her I hear the guy behind me that I just shot yell out, ?Mama, Nooo!!?. As he says this I turn my head and look at him then turn back to the woman and I just start to sob. I lean forward and sob on the woman?s shoulder. After the sobbing started it?s like everything just froze. The woman was froze in place and was rigged. Her mouth stayed open from the moment I disarme! d her till the dream blacked out again. After the dream blacks out I wake up in bed and instantly lean forward and sit up. I look at the clock and it?s now 4:30AM CST. I then  lay back down and close my eyes till my alarm.

 The part when I fighting those random people always makes me question. ?Did they abduct me and take me to some farm and I attacked it? Or was it a simulation on their ship??. I believe it was a combat simulation that I was put into. During the dream the fighting in the dream there was a weird white light coming from the sky. There were no stars. Just pitch black nothingness. This abduction makes me think that they were testing my combat capabilities. Believe that I am possibly in a bloodline that might have to fight something later on.

  Months after this abduction (and still to this day) I have something that I can only describe as a ?Combat sense?. When I was just trying to think my mind would constantly make scenarios. If someone was to attack me at any moment my mind was giving me the fighting moves I needed to do. Even when I was typing this report I felt it kick in. They want me to fight. And I believe that other possible bloodlines will join in this fight.

If I have a dream with a UFO  in it I believe I was abducted. Sometimes there is no dream and I just wake up with a random scab.

My wife and I go on a half mile walk around our neighborhood every night after dinner.  As we finished our walk and were returning to our driveway around 8:15 PM, I am enjoying the view of the stars for the first time in weeks, as there has been terrible smoke cover for over a month due to the wildfires.  As I'm looking south at the stars, I noticed one of these stars is moving across the sky.  It looked JUST like a star, very bright, white light; however, it was 4-5x larger than a star typically looks.  We observed carefully as it tracked overhead for 2-3 minutes; there were definitely no flashing lights or any changes in the brightness; however, it did appear to veer from side to side changing course several times (although this could have been imagined, I don't know for sure).  About 75% accross the sky towards the opposite horizon, the light begins to shimmer into more of a reflection, and slowly vanishes in clear view, long before reaching the horizon.  While! I am not saying that this was 100% a UFO, I am confident it was NOT an aircraft, missile, or satellite. It had no flashing lights, red or white; it made no noise, and was WAY too high to be a helicopter. It was dead quiet out, and if it was a plane, we can always hear their engines several seconds late. I will say that I do have a personal interest in UFOs, so it may be a confirmation bias; but at the same time, it was a very strange light that I've never seen anything like before, and did look very similar to other videos I've seen that made a strong case for being a true unidentified flying object.

 When checking off Characteristis below, this triggered a memory; about 2 minutes before seeing this light, i noticed an airplane with solid, yellow lights on the bottom in a triangular shape. I made note of this to my wife as it seemed odd to see a plane in flight with solid illumination lights on the bottom like this, in addition to their flashing red/white traffic lights. I am not sure if this is related or not but figured I should mention. It was travelling in the same direction as the ball of light, about 1-2 minutes before the ball of light was seen. This plane did not make a noise either (I guess we can hear planes if they are low enough/increasing elevataion? Must've been at cruising altitude but strange to see it close enough to make out these details and not hear it).","General Manager, lumber distribution yard",2,1,"light",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2020,2020,3,9,20,"Evening","West",0,1,0,0,0

I was sitting outside facing due east. My gaze was drawn up to a point of light about 45 degrees off the horizon. It was just a flash but it had a discernable round shape. It flew west and was immediately over my head. I stood and turned but it was gone. It was brighter than any star (and more focused) but moved much faster than any normal aircraft. Regardless of its distance from me nothing other than the space shuttle or possibly a meter could have moved that fast other than perhaps a missile or other such projectile. It had no engine noise and was silent BUT unlike a meteor it had no trail or ?streak? of light, it was perfectly focused.

I can only estimate its? speed  under two possible circumstances; IF it was 20 miles or more away then its? speed had to be in the thousand of MPH. If it was within a couple of miles then it might have appeared to be moving at 800-1000 MPH.

Every previously known experience I?ve had rules out every possibility that I am familiar with. It was too fast or too quiet or too bright and focused.

A substantially visible, thick, contrail-like plume was following an aircraft-like craft from a low altitude over Puget Sound to a higher altitude, with the plume spreading as it moved. Traveling west to east. It resembled a rocket or missile but was probably too slow to be a missle and was not clear enough to determine with the unaided eye. The bright, wide plume following it partly obscured the back end of the craft. This was not like a normal aircraft plume. It was highly unusual. The path was also unusual (a long arc changing from vertical to horizontal) and the plume was thicker than a normal airplaine. I captured video but parts of it are fuzzy (high contrast from tree silhouettes at sunset) and my viewing angle was not ideal (trees in the way). There is an airport here but this did not appear to originate from the airport. It appeared from Puget Sound or farther west over the ocean. Plume was bright orange due to the sunset effects until it reach a hi! gher more easterly altitude and more easterly trajectory, then it appeared as a normal whitish color. I've never seen anything like it. It did not look like falling satellite debris, it looked like it was self-powered or launched and then self-powered heading east toward eastern Washington State. If I held my finger up when it was traveling upward, it took several seconds for it to reach the other side of my finger. It was more rocket-like than plane-like but I cannot guess what it was. It traveled a considerable distance to the east (this was not a small local phenomenon like fireworks rockets, it was something bigger) and disappeared into the distance.

I had gone into my bathroom to take a shower and looked out the window to the southwest. I saw this unusually long cloud that had a separation about 2/3 of the way up and many broken clouds below. It looked like a missile launch.  As I watched it grew longer as it slowly moved across the sky without changing shape or breaking up.  I thought it may be a missile launch as I can and have watched them go off from Vandenburg AFB.  So, I checked the missile launch schedule and there was nothing scheduled today.  An Atlas 5 is due to go off from Cape Canaveral on the 13th and there is a Chinese Long March that has yet to be scheduled and a Falcon 9 to go up on the 14th-15th from Kennedy Space Center.

 To Whom It May Concern:  I am sending this information on to you so you can have a look see to come up with your own conclusion.  I?m not saying it is a UFO.  I am just saying it doesn?t look like a bird, plane or balloon etc.  Below is a bullet point list of how to view on Google Earth and other notes or observations I may have.  I hope you find it interesting.

 ?	If in Google Earth (GE), type in this address to fly you there.  It is not my address or anyone I know.  It is just what GE lists as a location when in street view.

&#61607;	1615 E. Cielo Grande Ave &#61607;	Phoenix, AZ ?	Or if in GE, these are their GPS coordinates to get you to the same area: &#61607;	33 degrees 41?42.56?  & 112 degrees 02?51.63? ?	As you can see, the round ball in the picture with the silvery top and what looks like to be a darkened shadow below.

?	I realize that in GE Street View, things can become distorted.  That is why I am not claiming it is a true UFO.

?	When GE takes you to this location, click to Street View Icon and try to go down to the very end of the dead end street to get the right view.  Reason being, is when I tried going back to this spot later, for some reason GE did not show that view and I had to play around with it to get it back up. Hopefully, you will not have that issue.

?	When in Street View, for some reason when you click to go back and forth down the street, it sometimes gives you a view that does not show the object.  I am not sure if it is a left over picture from a previous Street View series or what.  But what I do look for is the bird that is sitting on top of the street lamp post as the indicator.

?	Deer Valley Airport, which is a smaller airport is to the West.

?	In testing my idea by going back out the street to find a plane flying in, you can definitely tell that it is a plane coming in to land at the airport.  But what I am looking at seems like a round ball which to me is definitely not a plane.

 Thanks, and hopefully you may have an answer for this.

 Sincerely,  Phoenix Arizona Resident.

 I will also send an email to the address you list below with the pictures of what I am speaking about.

On December 31st at about 21:00 hours I just finished dinner and walked outside and sat down on the patio. I noticed two aircraft flying in the southern sky from the west to east, one larger, higher up and further out and one smaller closer and lower in altitude. Then out of the corner of my eye I saw another aircraft flying the same path in the space between the two other aircraft but behind. The speed of it did not seem out of the ordinary.

This one got my attention. I got up and walked out away from the patio and watched it. What caught my attention was it was orange with no other blinking lights as general aircraft would have. I was trying to see other lights on it and its altitude verses the other aircraft traveling the same path.

My initial thought was it was higher than both. Then I saw it slow and seemed to turn north but then stop. I thought only a helicopter can do that but its too high and no other lights can be seen on the aircraft. Now I am wishing I had my camera. It stayed in that position for about 15 to 20 seconds then just faded out. My thoughts where it left the sky in a southern path directly in opposite line with my sight of it.

I have seen over the year?s flairs dropped during military exercised in the very distance and I have seen missiles launched also. This was neither.

I stood and watched for about 10 minutes the area where the light faded out to see anything and nothing appeared, it was gone. During the entire time of this sighting, I witnessed no sound from the aircraft.

I am only making this report because of these facts, I have never seen anything like this in my 58 years. We live south east of Sky Harbor Airport and have seen large jets to small aircraft in our southern skies for 35 years. The sky was clear, and this object traveled in a horizontal path with no discernable arch.

Driving up 528 bridge headed towards Merritt Island, and saw triangular shaped craft hovering about 6-10 feet above the top of the bridge. Pulled over to observe craft for a little less than 5 minutes.

 1. Gun metal grey, smooth no surface features 2. Completely silent 3. Headed South when it took off to outer space (like a bullet out of a rifle both south and to outer space) 4. No engines, propellers, no windows.

When it took off the whole bottom of the craft glowed bright like welders torch bright   -This was gathered from a recent discussion about a craft seen about 20 years ago. I am not the witness, I spoke to the witness and was given this information after writing it down. I have small  than illustration can upload later.

 -The peculiar aspect to the craft was how it made the witness feel, she could not decide to either get out and try and touch the craft or drive off with her small girls in the car.

 -It most definitely was not Venus, a weather balloon, an experimental aircraft, reflections of any type of swamp gas, etc. It was a real, physical, metallic object that behaved unlike any craft the witness had ever observed.

 -Witness was a military brat, and father was in Army.

 -When the craft took off to the South, it pushed/pulled the water below the craft, signalling it had not only interacted with our atmosphere, but the water in the river. So in short, the craft was hovering ten feet above the top of the bridge, and 50 feet which is the height of the bridge. So a 60 foot distance interaction took place between the craft and the surface of the water when it took off.

 -The year/date are not exact, the time of day is 3-4 P.M./15:00-16:00.

 -Witness contacted NASA, and Patrick Air Force Base, both told her no craft were in the vicinity.

 -Witness contacted multiple news stations, but those stations ignored her, claiming that no sightings were reported by anybody else, so it was grounds for them to ignore it.

 (I feel it is my responsibility to share this information because I can type fast, am college educated and do believe the U.S. Government is lying about almost everything ET related).

((NUFORC Note:  Report from former member of Nike launch team.  PD))","Nike Hercules Firing Battery Track of UFO in Germany
By Retired Chief Warrant Officer ((witness's name deleted by NUFORC))
26 January 2021

Recent disclosures of UFO sightings have made me want to reveal an event that took place while stationed in the Army in Germany from 1968 to 1971 at a Nike Hercules Missile Battery (Charlie Battery 3rd Battalion 71st Artillery).  Along with one Battery Control Officer (BCO) and 9 operators and maintenance crewmen we identified, selected and auto tracked what we believed to be an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO).  As a crew we acquired, tracked and documented all its movements during approximately 10 minutes (could be more or less time, just don?t remember).
After 52 years I wanted to explain and document our manning crew?s experience selecting, tracking and recording this UFO event.  This tracking event took place in the year 1969 or 1970.  Memory does not serve me on the exact year and date.  Although I think it may have been 1969.  However, the UFO tracking event took place around midnight.  It starts by saying that the on-duty manning crewmembers were responsible for checks and adjustments and the operational condition of all assigned radars, vans, equipment and the integration of the system as a whole.  The system was kept ready to identify, track and launch a missile at a target in a specified time at the direction of Battalion Operations Center.  This was basically the mission of 3rd Battalion 71st Artillery Air Defense mission as part on North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). 
As part of this UFO event, I think it is necessary to provide background description of the overall system and manning skills of a Nike Hercules Missile Firing Battery:  The Firing Battery consisted of an Integrated Fire Control (IFC) and a Launch Area (LA) which were separated by approximately one mile.  That night we were manning the IFC which included the Low Powered Acquisition Radar (LOPAR), High-Powered Acquisition Radar (HIPAR) (not sure the HIPAR was on site at the time of the event) and the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) transmitter and receiver, these two radars and IFF were controlled by the Battery Control (BC) van.  
The BC van was manned by the Battery Control Officer (BCO) and an Acquisition, Computer, Switch Board, and Early Warning Plotting Board operators.  These positions were all Military Occupational Specialty (MOSs) 16C Integrated Fire Control Crewmember and a Defense Acquisition Radar Mechanic 24P. 
The RC van controlled the Target Tracking Radar (TTR), Target Ranging Radar (TRR) and Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) and was manned by 16Cs and a 24Q Integrated Fire Control Mechanic MOSs.  Manning for the RC van included Tracking Supervisor, Azimuth, Elevation and Range and MTR operators in the MOS 16C and a 24Q maintenance man.  All these men as I remember participated and witnessed the event discussed below.
That night our crew was performing 6 hour checks and adjustments.  Which we performed every 6 hours during our 24- hour manning period.  After all the equipment was adjusted to a specific tolerance in accordance with the Technical Manuals (TMs) and to ensure everything was working together as a system, we would perform a simultaneous tracking test where a target was selected by BC van and electronically given to RC van and the tracking radars console operators in the van.  This test ensured all tracking radars were accurately auto tracking together in range, azimuth, elevation and speed.   This was then verified by the Computer in the BC van.
On this particular night I was the Acquisition Radar operator 16C/On the Job Training (OJT) 24P Acquisition Radar Mechanic in the BC van.  For this particular simultaneous test, I selected a random target traveling in the direction of about 120 to 150 degrees in azimuth and at a range of 20-30 miles from our site and it had a good strong return signal from the Acquisition Radar and as displayed on the Planned Position Indicator (PPI) in the BC van.  I passed the target (UFO) off to the BC van where TTR, TRR and MTR operators auto locked on to the UFO and started auto tracking it.  At first it seemed to be a normal track, then it stopped in range and speed as shown on the tracking radars and verified by the Computer dials in the BC van.  The UFO continued to showed a signal return (we called radar blip) on the PPI in the BC van.  At this point it was challenged with the IFF.  It did not respond to the challenge.  Then the UFO started moving left and then right in azimuth within one or two PPI sweep revolutions. It showed no speed, very little change in elevation movement on the tracking radars and verified by the computer dials.  The elevation was around 15 thousand feet.  We reported the UFO to the Battalion Operations Center which I believe had us to go to Battle Stations, if memory serves me).  When I realized that this was not a normal target but what I perceived to be an UFO, I turned on the Horizontal and Vertical Plotting Boards. The Horizontal Plotting Board showed the position of the tracked UFO, in azimuth and range as plotted by computer-controlled plot pens. The Vertical Plotting Board plotted the altitude of the target as well as the calculated time for missile interception should we be directed to fire.  I also turned on the Multi-Channel Data Recorder (MCDR) which recorded data of the entire engagement for later analysis.  The computer compared the position, course, altitude and speed of the UFO and in case we were directed to engage.
After moving right and left the UFO stopped moving all together and started to go up in elevation (altitude).  It started slowly and then picked up speed.  In the end it was going up so fast in elevation that the Computer dials were just zinging and the numbers printed on the dials looked like a blur.  The tracking radars lost the UFO around somewhere around 100K feet and it was no longer displayed on the PPI.  It took about 5-10 seconds to reach that altitude.  After the event was over, the crew all agreed that it was probably a UFO.  We had never experienced such an unexplained target before or after this event.
The next morning after our final 6 hour checks and adjustments and before we got off manning an Air Force Major (I think) and an Air Force Enlisted person showed up at the Interconnection building which provided entry to BC, RC and Maintenance vans.  They asked and received the Plotting Board papers and the Event Recorder paper and they left the tact site.  
In summary, we never heard anything about this event.  This is why I am writing this paper after 52 years of wondering if our UFO event was documented somewhere and if not, I would like to submit this paper as proof that these events of that night on manning really happened as best as can recall.  This UFO event can be independently verified by the on-duty crewmembers who witnessed the events above and as well documented by the Plotting Board papers and the Event Recorder paper taken by the Air Force.","Retired",7,0,"unknown",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1969,1960,4,11,0,"Night",NA,0,1,0,0,0

	The object I saw was clearly lower than air traffic in my area, and also moving in the opposite direction of the air traffic flow of my area. I was walking up the block, and as I was nearing the end of the block, and object moved over my head, and disappeared over the buildings. I moved up the block to get a better view, but there was nothing in the trajectory in which the object was moving.

	 My best description of the object is that it was cylindrical, and had a light in front, with almost like a fog in front like it was passing through clouds. It's a pretty clear night, and it looked lower than the cloud line. I can't remember any blinking lights, but I do remember seeing a trail behind it, sort of like a shooting star. I can barely see anything in the sky in Brooklyn, and I've seen my fair share of shooting stars. It was too discernable to be one.

 	I'm a pretty skeptical person, but after an hour of thinking about the event, I have no rational explanation for it, other than it being some new type of drone or something I've never seen before. It didn't move like your traditional consumer drone. There's also a missile launch tonight in Florida but this was way too close to the ground and too fast to be a missile, even if it was visible from New York.

I am a retired 69 year old female Deputy Sheriff and the following is what transpired:  It was late evening and I was sitting on my back porch when I saw, what I thought was a very bright star in the eastern sky.  My next thought was that it was the brightest star that I had ever seen.  I looked for other stars and there were none to be seen.

 I looked back at the object and realized that it was going up and at a slight right angle.  My first thought was that it was a rocket launch from the Cape.  Looking harder at the object I could see a blue haze in front of the object with the bright white light in back of the object.

 At this point I called my sister.  I wanted her to see if she could see it also.  When she answered, I started telling her to go outside.  Not having taken my eyes from the object all of a sudden the white light disappears, a few seconds later there was a huge blue flash and then the blue just faded away.

 I then went on line and according to NASA there had been no launches that day.

Earlier this evening at around 8:45PM-9:15PM local time I witnessed some type of drone craft over Redstone Arsenal visible from a neighborhood just Northeast of Gate 10. It had lights and flashers consistent with FAA regulations. The craft slowed to a hover and after a couple minutes it delivered a payload of what seemed to be short-burst comet-type effects that lasted 8-10 seconds with 8 or 9 projectiles that launched out and then back toward the vessel in a circular arc. After the initial display the drone returned back southeast, was presumably reloaded and then delivered the same payload to the same location albeit slightly closer to my location about 10-12 minutes later. I dunno if they are working on some type of pyro display for a corporate retreat or 4th of July celebration, but it was pretty darn cool-looking for the small effect as it was. If a bunch of these were synced up to a timed show and launched closer to the audience radius I could see it h! aving a nice affect in conjunction with a traditional pyro display.

As I'm watching, it sharply turns towards the plane and speeds up. I'm panicked because I think that it's a missile or something that's going to hit the plane. It appeared to be heading directly towards me. as it gets closer, I see that it's going to go underneath the plane and not on a collision course. After the panic of potentially dying wears off, I'm oddly calm and entranced. The object is metallic, silvery with no apparent windows, and quite a bit larger than I had thought. It's cigar or oval-shaped, with no wings or tail. ! It passes underneath the plane, right below my window. It was strange in that it seemed to know that I had noticed it.

I sighted an Unidentified Flying Object in the summer (Aug/Sep) of 1968 in the Pacific Ocean.

At the time, I was a Captain and a highly qualified Navigator (5,000+ hours flying time) with the US Air Force, and was flying a C-124 Globemaster aircraft from Bucholz Army Airfield located on Kwajalein Island, Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands to Hickam Air Force Base at Honolulu, Hawaii.  I flew the route periodically and had never encountered any other aircraft traffic on that route.  As far as I knew, only the Military Airlift Command wing at Hickam Wing and their C-124s were the only aircraft the ever flew in this part of the world ? and the purpose of our missions was to ferry supplies and a few passengers between Hawaii, Johnston Island, Kwajalein, & Eniwetok.

 Circumstances at time of sighting: Location:	16N ? 176W (approximate) Date:		August 16, 1968 (approximate) Time:		Approx. 0800 GMT (Local time ? 2100) Altitude:	9,000 feet Airspeed:	200 Knots Heading:	Approx. 060 degrees, true Weather:	Clear ? Unlimited visibility ? Dark ? Moon:		Waxing Gibbous ? overhead, slightly behind aircraft Lights:		None on Ocean Surface ? only nav lights on aircraft ? using red light in cockpit  I was between required fixes, and was sitting in the co-pilot seat in the cockpit (co-pilot was in the bunk).  Cockpit instrument lights were configured red for night flying.

I spotted a light green glow on the ocean in front of us (relative heading 30 degrees).  Due to lack of fixed objects outside the aircraft, would estimate the spot was 3-4 miles in front of us.  I pointed the object out to the Aircraft Commander (Maj. Hal Walthal) and between us we speculated what it might be.  It looked like the glow was under the ocean surface and appeared several 100 feet in diameter, although there was no way to know for sure, as there were no outside references and we were at 9,000 feet.

We speculated we might be looking at ?maybe? a missile equipped submarine with a door open and that was what was emitting the light.  We talked about the French testing nuclear weapons in French Polynesia, but knew that was about 5,000 miles south of us.  We recheck NOTAMs and there was nothing mentioned there.

As we came closer (perhaps the spot was 1 mile away at our 2:30 position, the light began rising vertically.  We picked up nothing on our weather radar (APS-42), and the green light continued to rise vertically  - perhaps at 10,000 ft/min rate of climb until it was ?far? above us (perhaps 30,000-40,000 feet) at which time the object literally performed an immediate, sharp. 90-degree turn to seeming level flight and headed in an Easterly direction.  It was still glowing green and its lateral acceleration was unbelievable ? perhaps 1,000?s of miles an hour, and almost immediately disappeared into the distance.  We knew the laws of physics would not permit any known vehicle to physically turn 90-degrees like that, nor accelerate to that speed that quickly.

As the UFO disappeared to the East, we discussed whether it might be a threat to the United States, even though the US coast was 3,000-4,000 miles away.  We pulled our instructions for filing a CIRVIS (Communications Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings) report, but as we composed the report, we speculated that whatever the UFO was, if its intent was to do damage to the US, it would likely be there and carry out its intended damage long before anyone received our report.  By now, we had the whole crew involved discussing our sighting.  Several of us ?knew of? people who had formally reported UFOs in the past, and knew they had spent years answering bizarre questions and being hounded by ?investigators?.  We speculated that formally reporting our sighting might wind up being a career-impacting event, and most of us were career-minded people.

So ? we ultimately chose not to file the CIRVIS report and let the event ?slide by?.  For the next several hours we tuned our HF radios to stations where we thought we might hear news if something or someone attacked the US.  It was a great personal relief that nothing ?weird? happened or was sighted in the US.  Some of us mentioned the event to our friends over the years,  but to my knowledge, no one ever filed an official report.

Incident occurred while attending basic training at Ft. Bliss, Tx. After revelry and before breakfast, my platoon was in the quad (large paved area in front of barracks used for marching and drill and ceremonies). Trainees were standing around smoking and waiting for the drill sergeant to finish inspecting the barracks. I was laying on the ground with my helmet liner under my head like a pillow staring up at the sky. The desert sky was always clear and so many more stars were visible compared to my home in Florida. I could nearly see from horizon to horizon as I stared at the sky. Suddenly, moving left to right in my line of vision, I don't know the actual direction, I saw what looked like five boomerangs or single chevrons like a private E-2 stripe in a formation. They were orange or red and looked as if they were glowing from friction with the atmosphere. They covered the distance from horizon to horizon in total silence in seconds and seemed to stutter jump as they flew. They didn't move smoothly, but seemed to jump forward and stop, jump forward and stop, but this took place so quickly they moved across the entire sky in two seconds or so. I really don't know if what I saw was one object with five chevron shaped lights, or if the chevron shaped lights were separate objects.

Preface: I sent my experience to MUFON as well about ten years ago. I do not know if you share databases.

While driving home alone on the Cleveland Highway headed east after an extracurricular event at Gainesville High School, I saw a disc object on the horizon above the trees directly in my line of sight where the Cleveland Highway curved to the left. This was a long time ago, and though the Cleveland Highway still exists, it has changed.  In 1968  it was a 2-lane highway with only several businesses, an elementary school, and Riverbend Baptist Church in view. Today I believe it is a 4-lane, but Riverbend Baptist Church is still there. The church was to my left when I noticed the object. The curve was approximately ? mile in front of me.

The disc was highly polished silver in color, with no visible seams and no windows. The silver was the more reflective of any object I had ever seen in the air. The disc appeared to be the size of what was a modern commercial jetliner of the time.  I cannot be sure of the size, but a jetliner came to mind for some reason. My perspective could be off because I was in shock.  The object hovered with no wavering or wobbling. It appeared fixed in space. Terrified and alone, I wanted to stop the car but worried that someone was behind me.

The speed limit at that time was around 35 miles per hour because of the elementary school that was further east on the right. I slowed down once I saw the object and checked my rearview mirror to see if anyone was behind me. The sun was low in the West. The bright glare in the mirror prevented me from seeing anything behind. The sun reflected off the object, but I could still make out the shape.  It was a disc that had a slight rise in the middle.

Now here is where my experience seems to differ from others. A message popped into my head. It was not audible. The message was something like, ?Martin Luther King will die today,? or ?Martin Luther Kind will be killed today.? I do not remember precisely at this point in my life. When I heard that in my head, I became numb, it was as though time stood still.  Please understand I was three weeks shy of my 17th birthday. I did keep up with politics and was socially concerned as a teen, but honestly, I had not given MLK much thought at that point in my life. I knew he was a social activist for civil rights. He was in the news often. I admired him, but I was only concerned with my social life in high school and rock and roll music that day. I was listening to WQXI- AM, the rock station out of Atlanta at that time. Once the thought registered, my eyes still on the object, I turned the radio dial hoping to get news. Maybe I had heard it earlier that he was dead, and it just had no! t sunk in?my attempt to find a news station while driving and looking ahead failed. It was at that time, and the object disappeared as though shot from a cannon. There was no noise, no sign it had been there. There had been no noise except my radio. Nothing. This event occurred at about 4:30 pm Eastern time.

I drove home shaken by what I saw and disturbed by what I believed was a random sick thought. Why would I think such a thing?  Having parked the car in the drive, I entered the house through the carport door into the kitchen area. My mother was there. She knew something had happened because she asked what was wrong. I asked her if she had heard on her radio or TV anything about MLK. She read more than she kept up with news, but she had heard nothing. I sat down at the kitchen table, I think. I told her what I saw. I told her about the thought. Then I asked her, ?Do you believe me?? She said she did, but she was my Mom. What could she say? I dropped it. Still, I went into my room in shock, knowing that I would not tell anyone else. The last thing I needed was to be called crazy, misfit, oddball, demented, delusional. I had no proof. I had cheerleading tryouts, tests, and so many social pressures. Maybe I was crazy.

That evening my father and I watched TV. The incident kept creeping back into my head, but I focused on the TV. I do not recall what we watched, but at about 9 pm, the show was interrupted by a news bulletin from the network. The desk reporter was on a black phone talking and said that MLK had been shot in Memphis at around 7:30 pm Central Time.  He was dead. The thought wasn?t mine. It had been placed in me. That was the only explanation. I got up and went to my room. I turned on my radio and listened to the breaking news. I had known. I had known but could have done nothing with the knowledge. I cried.

The next day before I left for school, Mom and I made eye contact. She blinked and nodded. I couldn?t talk about it. I walked out the door and drove to school.

I never mentioned it again until years later when I met my future husband, now ex. When we had young children, we hung out with several other couples with children. I remember sharing my story with one of those couples because they, too, had had an encounter when they were college students in Alabama. I felt safe in sharing. When my kids were in their teens, I told them. They laughed and joked about my being a hippie. I shrugged it off. Why would they believe? I sent my story to MUFON sometime around 2010. Nothing. It is on record. But now that UFPs are acknowledged as something, I am compelled to share with every organization that logs encounters. Many people have seen UFPs. Some believe they were abducted. Only 90% of what I read on the subject is credible, but I know what I know about myself. It?s real. It was in the light of day. I know.

I have no way of knowing whether the object communicated to others that day in the area where I was. I have not read of any stories where witnesses shared they were told of a historical event that came to pass. Maybe some have, but I do not know about them. I have no proof that of the message. But I have carried this with me for many decades. Until 2017 I only recalled the incident on the anniversary of MLK?s death. Otherwise, I pushed it back. Now it is with me every day.  I am in the sunset of my life. I am on my last lap. Now you know. Take it for what it is.","Retired",NA,1,"disk",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1968,1960,2,4,16,"Afternoon","South",0,1,0,0,0

Hello -

My name is ((name dleted)). I am a music teacher and photographer who lives on the West Side of Santa Cruz, California.

I am writing to ask for your help in interpreting one of the strangest things I have ever seen. It has been occurring since late October and continues each night there are no clouds or rain.

On October 29th my neighbors and I first noticed two unidentifiable lights in our neighborhood - one smaller and distant, the other large and seemingly closer. I am a layman and not a scientist, but I feel like I can rule out a planet because:
- they don't move position in the sky from night to night, or even
week to week.They appear to return to the same coordinates each night;
Both the smaller light and the large and bright one move in the sky visible to the naked eye. The smaller lights? movement is very jagged. The brighter objects? movement is more of a swaying back and forth.
When I center the brighter object with my camera on a tripod, it moves out of frame in minutes, to the point where it is no longer visible from my vantage point. After several repositionings of the tripod, I have always had to move to a new location to continue shooting it.
The brighter object has many smaller, fainter, fast moving lights near and around it that are very visible in the screen of my camera when it is in live view.
The brighter object is usually accompanied by a triangular looking object that moves from frame to frame around and near it, photos 5347-5357. There is some wind, but the tripod is fixed, and to my layman?s eye it appears to show both objects moving in contrary motion to one another.
I have also been videotaping the object since October 30th with my cell phone. I am enclosing a few videos and some freeze frames.

In movie 1423, I was actually able to film the brighter object arriving in daylight.
In movie ?Video 2,? taken on 11/13/21, watch for a series of flashes, about 25 in all, starting in the upper right moving left, above and around the bright object. I did freeze frames of these flashes, which are enclosed.
In movie 1579, taken November 23rd at 5:48, to the lower left of the bright object is a smaller flashing light, which when zoomed in on looks very curious, almost like a metallic, spinning hexagram.

Beginning on November 10th, I started using my Nikon D750 on a tripod (although I had to move the tripod several times when the lights were moving quickly.)

After observing and photographing the larger object with my 500mm lens, it seems like there is a pattern to what is occurring on a nightly basis. I want to say again that I am a layman, and so the terms and descriptions I use may not be scientific or accurate, but they describe what a layman has seen and photographed on several nights.

The object arrives as a sphere (Movie 1423, taken November 6th at 6:27pm).
It seems to grow in size and brightness and then goes through a series of intense flashes, lasting several seconds, where the intensity of the light increases, and the sphere appears to change shape.
In the photos where the sphere is not a sphere any longer, for lack of any other way to describe it, multi-colored, worm-like objects that to my layman?s eye resemble DNA strands fill the entire sky. To my unscientific eye they appear to be clones of the object in some way, because these ?DNA strands? are the exact shape of the nearby object as it flashes with different shapes in each of these photos. I have taken photos of this on a few different nights. Photos 4812-4912 are from 11/10/21 at 7:55pm. Photos 5615, 5677, and 5691 were taken on 11/17 at 8:30pm and show very similar images to 11/10. 5691 shows a stick like object that appears in many other photos.

The last series of photos from 11/24/21 are for me the most puzzling and the most disturbing. I can only describe it in my very unscientific terms. During this stage the object moves a lot, and so I was struggling to keep up with it. They show the main, bright object being surrounded by multi-colored projectiles of some sort. I struggled to get the first shots of this, photos 5364-5378, which are partially obscured by the trees. (One interesting thing to note is the way the triangular object is visible even through the tree in photo 5364). In photo sequence 5379-5385, I got a clear shot of this head on. The projectiles surround the bright object and seemingly penetrate it like sperm to an ovum for lack of a better metaphor, exploding out the other side of the object with a great flash of energy. On November 17th I captured the same images a third time just before the object moved and went out of range, photos 5781-5794.

In August of 1972 at 11:00 pm, I was at Northwestern Univ. parked 60 ft from the observatory with my boyfriend sitting in a car talking. Suddenly we saw a tiny bright light which I thought was a low star. It was very far away. Within 5 seconds it was upon us. It was a classic ""flying saucer' looking object. approx 90 ft long. It was a grey silver color. It had a bottom stand that was circular and had holes all around the base. It looked as if there was a white ball of energy swirling around it very fast. There were no doors or windows on the side that we could see. It hovered over the observatory and then made a dead stop in mid-air about 12 ft above the observatory building. I wanted to get out and get a closer look as we were approx 60 ft away but my boyfriend was terrified and refused to allow me to get out of the car. It remained there for about 6-7 minutes. Then suddenly it lifted up about ten ft, moved slightly to the right where there was a clearing, a road, and then took off at meteoric speed. It was as if it went from zero to 10,000 mph in a nanosecond It was completely out of sight in less than 2 seconds. It seemed to go as fast as a bullet.

The road and mountain side was as bright as day. I remember seeing the blades of grass in the light. There was a truck driver coming from Las Cruces who had pulled over to the side of the road. He was standing outside of his semi hand on his hip watching the ball. The ball moved vertically and horizonally. I was ruling out possibilities such as weather balloon or missile launching those things didn't maneuver like this thing. I realized this was something I had never seen before and it wasn't earthly. I sped over the pass and drove fast to Las Cruces and home. Next morning I called my cousin who was stationed at WSMR and they had no launching of balloons or missiles. He laughed at me when I told him what I saw. Then Sunday morning's newpaper reported three reports by people that had seen a large reddish ball following them at night.

I initially thought it was a meteor, as it started as a faint light, but, the object?s brightness increased, as though it was heating up. The color of the light was not white-hot like a meteor, but, more yellow, and the light was not from a sharp point, but rather seemed to have a haze around it. I did not notice any trail of smoke or debris following it. As it traveled, the brightness did not seem to fade significantly like a meteor does as it disintegrates.

I was sitting on my front porch. Weather was clear and warm for January. Was mid-afternoon. Can't remember the exact day. I heard a sound somewhat like a small private prop. plane, but different. I live just a mile from Roanoke-Blacksburg regional airport. I like aircraft, so I was interested to see what this odd-sounding plane was. I looked around, but didn't see anything at first. Then, I looked up and toward the south, and up a few thousand feet. I saw a craft that looked, as best I can describe, like an air launched cruise missile. A long, but not cylindrical fuselage with vertical and horizontal stabs at the rear. No wings. Maybe a bit larger than a private plane. It had a brown haze around it. The haze and no wings is what made me want to report this incident. Aircraft flying by before this at altitude were very clear with no haze. It was flying level in a south-south easterly direction. It's speed was unremarkable at the moment I saw it. My binoculars were just inside my front door, about eight feet from where I was sitting. I reached in and grabbed them to get a better look at the craft, but it had disappeared in those few seconds I had my back turned. I can't swear that the noise I heard was this craft, since I'm so close to the airport, but it did get me looking all around. I have looked at photos of our military drones, but none look like what I saw.

Last night (4/15/2022) was near full moon phase, and since initially it was a clear cloudless sky, I went out into the front yard for some fresh air to marvel at the sky. I currently live in a rural part of Hungary with little to no light pollution so the stars and the rather frequently passing satellites are almost always easily visible. As I was taking in the interesting light conditions caused by the illumination of the moon, I spotted a faint light, what I initially suspected to be a satellite. It entered my sight of vision from the north west and it had a south-easterly heading. I normally would have dismissed it as a satellite as it mostly behaved like one; the speed seemed constant and it was heading on a straight trajectory. The only thing that made me maintain visual contact with it was that it randomly and abruptly flashed up (twice maybe 3 times) with a white light similar to what I could describe as camera flash. It wasn't plane strobe lights--I'm familiar with those--and it wasn't random due to cloud cover, as it was completely clear and all the starts around it were clearly visible. In addition to the few and random flashes, it also began to fade somewhat but then in a matter of seconds it would go back to its original brightness. All of this was still nothing out of the ordinary. The fading and the flashing I assumed could be the result of the satellite turning and reflecting the light of the sun and/or the moon (sun was obviously not visible to me as it was 21:05 (GMT+2) +/- 5 minutes). The fading I figured was the object getting slightly closer to where the moon was (thus the moon light overpowering the illumination from the sun in the back). However, I found the re-illumination a little strange, but still nothing out of the ordinary. The flashing I also attributed to the possible drone activity--due to the current situation in Ukraine there's frequent aerial military presence in the region with NATO drones monitoring the area (I regularly check adsbexchange for activity). Once again, until this point there was nothing I hadn't seen before. However, after its re-illumination, the object (I'm still having goosebumps as I'm typing this) all of a sudden (literally in a split second) accelerated while doing a half infinity symbol like loop and shot off back to where it came from with now a north-westerly heading. The acceleration and the loop-like movement happened simultaneously and in a fashion I had never witnessed before; there was no anticipation or build up of any kind--they were both instantaneous. As the object shot off to where it came from, it even left a small light flare like tail behind it (for a millisecond) similar to a tracer bullet. The acceleration with the loop like turn and the disappearance all happened in less then a second. Obviously, all of this happened without any sound so it could not have been a jet fighter (familiar with those too and they are not capable of such movement). It also wasn't a shooting star; I've seen plenty of those too and I have never seen them do a 180 turn. I couldn't believe what i had just witnessed. I then entered the house to tell a family member who in response also ran out to observer the sky. We continued to monitor the sky for a few minutes, hoping it would come back, but it obviously didn't. 10 to 15 minutes later, we went back inside, and that's when I messaged my brother about what I had seen (that's how I have the accurate time). I also checked adsbexchange to see if there was any military or drone activity in the area, but other than the usual commercial traffic (often quite busy) and a few military transport planes (US and German Military) there was nothing in the area. Even if there was, this was definitely not plane like performance. For the next hour or so, I continued to go out and check to see if I could spot something similar. I even grabbed a pair of binoculars. I observed the occasional air traffic and some common satellite movement, which I now understandably followed with more scrutiny, but for a while there was noting unusual. Then, at around 22:00+gmt (maybe +30min), a similarly satellite like object appeared from the north north west. The object was once again approaching silently with an average satellite like speed and a constant whitish glow. Once again, not unlike a common satellite. Except, this object began to slow down and eventually came to a full stop above me with a 5-10 degree deviation to the north north west from the Zenith. As it began to slow down, I once again alerted the same family member, who instantly ran out and witnessed the slowing of the object. The object then began to slowly shift back and forth, left and right, and doing little but observable adjustments in its movement. In the binoculars it seemed like a regular star accept it was slowly moving. The motion was not due to shifts in my movement (due to breathing, etc.) nor would I attribute it to the shake in the binoculars. The small movements were clearly visible by both me and the other observer. After about 5-10 minutes of no other action, a cloud cover crept in, at which point the object along with all other celestial objects were no longer observable. The rest of the night was overcast and so is the following day (4/16/2022). I couldn't take a photograph or record it on video as the light was too faint and little to be picked up on camera. The first observation happened unexpectedly and very quickly. I have no idea what this object was, but based on the physics of the first observation, this was definitely not an airplane.","Student/ Graphic Designer/ Illustrator/ ESL Teacher",2,1,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2022,2020,2,4,21,"Evening",NA,0,1,0,0,0

Where I live we are the only house for at least a mile around. A few other houses are close but they are usually empty unless someone rents one. A field is across the house and the little red river lies just behind. As far as I know only my house was occupied at the time of the fourth sighting that i am recording here. I was the only one awake. I have seen multiple UFO's in my location over the past 5 months. This was the fourth. I have not filed a report on them as I did not take the effort to record what day's and what time I saw them. The first was a red orb that was the brightest object in the sky. It moved slowly back and fourth and then quickly moved, ( so quick it could not have been a drone ), down past the visible tree line. This was facing south from my location. The second was a bright yellow object that I can only describe as triangular that to me was only visible beyond the tree line facing east. That one was the closest as it was very obviously a few thousand feet away and the tree line facing east is very tall almost tall enough to cover the moon. That one was the most different from the other sightings. I watched it go behind the trees in a slow turtle like movement. The sky was clear that night and it was around 8 p.m. Later that night my dog in the further part of the back yard saw something and was frozen for about 10 minutes. I did not attempt to walk to him. The third was an object that stayed in the sky in the southwest. The sky was clear. It changed between the colors of blue and red and moved side to side and would make sudden but slow moves diagonally and up and down. I watched it for about 5 minutes and then left. I'm not certain but it was sometime during the ten o'clock hour. I'm not sure how long it remained after i stopped watching. It was much to high and bright to be a drone. The final and fourth sighting took place around 10:30. It was the only light in the sky as it was overcast. It was red like the first sighting. It was in the south eastern sky. It was stationary and did not move. After about one to two minutes of watching it blinked out. I did not continue to monitor. Old de-commissioned missile silos are in the valley that I live. That is the only reason I can think of for the amount of UFO sightings I have had. As well as there is excellent views of the night sky without light pollution. I have not reached out to the community for verification of what I saw. However I am certain I could not have been the only person to see these events. They were to obvious. I do not have a phone that cand record the night sky and do not have the resources to gain a camera that could record them at current time.

I was the boat coxswain for a U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue duty crew on shift at the U.S. Coast Guard Station Jones Beach. Around 2300, a report was received from a civilian pleasure boat captain of a flare South of Jones Inlet. His approximate location was 5 miles nearly due South of the inlet. We got underway in our 41' UTB rescue boat. Visibility was excellent, greater than 10 miles. We didn't have NVGs so cloud cover couldn't be well determined, but were not a factor in this observation. I do not recall the phase of the moon on this night. As we were approaching his position, from approximately 3 miles out, we could see the light he was reporting. It was a single red light, brighter than a normal aircraft position light. Its color was not that of a flare. Flares have a distinctive red color and pulse irregularly. This light was the same color red as a port position light and steady. In addition, it was stationary in the sky. It's perceived size and brightness did not change. Since we were still approaching it's position from approximately 3 miles out, its relative bearing was changing. Based on this, I estimate it was at least 1000 feet in altitude, but perhaps as high as 5000 feet. As we approached the reporting vessel, we pulled alongside and spoke with the captain. The civilian vessel had two people on board including the captain and our Coast Guard vessel had a crew of 3. Approximately 30 to 45 seconds after we pulled alongside the reporting vessel, the light exited to the East at an extremely high speed.

To me, this is the interesting part. There was no discernable acceleration curve from stationary to its max velocity. One second it was stationary in the sky, the next instant it was like a bullet shot out of a gun heading rapidly East. The light was out of site to the East in about 1 second. It's impossible to say if the light extinguished as it was exiting or if it simply got too far away to see. However, it appeared to remain lit far out to the East before the light was no longer visible.

We spoke with the Captain for a few minutes more and reported the sighting to the base station. The civilian captain reported via radio to the Coast Guard station that the light shot off to the West, but I corrected him and said it was to the East. He acknowledged the correction.","Compliance Director",5,1,"light",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,1992,1990,2,6,23,"Night","Northeast",0,1,0,0,0

I was by myself sitting at a traffic light while exiting southbound Interstate 95 onto State Road 16. While sitting at the red light I looked up and to my left. I saw a circular light hovering in the sky. It was a picture perfect day with no clouds. Whatever it was it was, it off in the distance, so it was hard to tell what exactly I was seeing. I snapped a pic while sitting at the light, simply to look at it later. The traffic light turned green and I started to turn left. At that moment, I saw something moving fast with a thick contrail coming from the ground from west to east toward it. I instantly thought it was a missile. Then my vision was obstructed for a few moments while driving. When the obstruction cleared, it was a sign as memory serves, I pulled over and took the additional picture and whatever it the light was, it was gone. All that was left was the remnants of the contrail. I filed a FOIA request for radar returns for the Saint Augustine airport for the time of the incident. The airport is approximately five miles away. I got the runaround. I kept getting asked why I wanted it. The last thing I wanted was to tell the U.S. government what I had seen. I let it die there. I'm only coming forward now, because I stumbled across the pic in my PC while rearranging picture folders. I hold a FAA Commercial certificate, but haven't flown in 20 years do to health issues.

I saw a red glowing light, which I thought was a missile of some kind. It was flying rapidly from the direction of Germantown, Ohio in a Southeast direction toward Cincinnati, Ohio. It stopped at a certain point and stayed there. I ran in to notify a facebook friend to try and get a witness, but it was gone when I ran back out.

No sound, no trail. I got out of bed to watch. Object travelled in a straight line at constant speed (not fast, but visibly moving). Estimate object travelled north, like a missile (but not at pace). Faint lights visible along length of object, no ""tail"" lights like an aircraft. Witnessed object for less than a minute (40secs?) before losing it behind nearby trees obsecuring my view.

At the time, considered videoing, but decided it was too dark and too far away to capture. I've never seen anything like this before - probably never will again.

I thought there might be a fire, or they were blowing stuff up as usual. The only thing is that I hear the explosions all the time, and last night it was really quiet. After the sky glowed and flickered red for 10 minutes, a fiery glowing red/orange egg shaped object rose above the tree line. For about a minute it just sat right at the tree line, almost looking like a sunset. It was 10pm when I started taking pictures, and the sunsets on the opposite side from where I was filming. I would've otherwise thought it was a missile or explosion, but it just sat there hovering. After some time it moved up above the tree line and become fully visible. It moved up and down, and then left and right for a few seconds, and then descended back beneath the tree line.

It went dark again for another 15 minutes, and then it rose again above the tree line but this time it was much dimmer, but bright enough to track it. It flew over toward mt ranier, really quickly and hovered there for another 10 minutes or so. Then it started moving again, except it got dimmer quickly and almost vanished in an instant. Not sure what that was...

The pictures dont really do it justice. It looks like a sunset but the sun does not set over mt ranier from where i live near olympia. Its opposite of the mountain, and it was after 10pm.

I was driving north on Leslie Canyon road about five miles north of Douglas, AZ which is right on the Mexican border adjacent to Agua Prieta, Sonora, Mexico. Looking to my left or to the west over the mountains I saw an extremely brightly lit cone shaped projectile light heading SE and the cork screw contrail from where it came from was in the NE which would be in the area of Tucson. It had a missile type shape to the front of it although I could not see the shape of missile behind the cone in the front. There was a cone shaped corona emitting from the tip of the object that spread out quite a distance from the ""tip"" of the object. I don't know how fast it was moving, but it was about the same speed as a jet aircraft as I could easily track it with my phone camera. It was sunset and the light emitted from the object eclipsed the sunset it was so bright. I thought to myself it could be a missile being shot at another object, but I did not see any other objects in the sky it could be aiming for. I presumed it might be a missile shot from Davis-Monthan AFB in Tucson. I was able to take video with my phone, but I was in the middle of the road and needed to pull to the side since a car was coming. I had my hazard lights on, but was concerned it would crash into me so I pulled over. While parking, disconnecting my safety belt and exiting the car, I inadvertently stopped the video. I thought it was still running as I ""filmed"" it continue to move over the Mexican border at which point the front part of the projectile ""blacked out"" and there was an object I could still see, but it was blurry and hard to make out.

I was out on highway road hunting and saw what I thought was a radio tower slowly blinking, until I realized it was in a holler below my vantage point on top of hill. Noticed it was slowly moving small movements side to side, so after watching it for about 5 minutes, I grabbed my spotlight out of truck. I lit it up, was some kind of aircraft about 25-30 feet wide & around 8-9 feet thick, looked to be a triangle shape with rounded tips, and on the sides of the points there where backlit red crystal like panels strobing slowly. I noticed it was extremely quiet running, was around 15 feet off the ground, and the trees & grasses beneath it seemed to be gently blowing around.

Approximately 11/12/2022 +- 3 days, about 9:00 to 10:00 p.m. on a moonless night, very clear sky, I was walking my horse traveling W to E in Burbank. I had an unobstructed view to the SE and S and saw aircraft lights similar to those of the numerous helicopters which routinely use a flight path coming from Glendale/Los Angeles around the eastern limit of the Santa Monica Mountains and south of the southern limit of the Verdugo Mountains, through the pass between them, into the San Fernando Valley to travel to either Burbank Airport or Van Nuys Airport or other locations in the SFV. There are routinely about half a dozen such aircraft I see every night about that time. They move quickly and noisily across the Valley. These are small planes, many helicopters, all flying low and a few more distant, much higher passenger planes from Burbank Airport or LAX. The helicopters and small planes all make motor noise that is easily noticeable. Last night I counted 6-7 aircraft in my normal 20 minutes walking my horse. On the night I saw a very unusual aircraft, I had no cell phone with me so far as I can recall. I routinely carry one on these walks but I believe I left it behind because it was uncharged. Even if I had one, it would have captured only the running lights, not the body of the craft. There was no light from the ground up toward the sky that illuminated the body at all. Coming toward my area of the Valley from the Glendale area to my SE, I noticed lights which I took to be a helicopter coming from the usual route over west Glendale along the I-5 and then bearing slightly west following the 134 freeway into the SF Valley. The lights appeared to be somewhat higher than most helicopters. The lights looked a little different and weren't flashing with the same rapidity of most helicopters. It drew my attention. I noticed that its speed was different as well, it seemed to take longer to get into the Valley and to get closer to me than normal aircraft. I halted my horse, which is very unusual since I am exercising him, not just getting some casual recreation, to observe this aircraft. As it got slowly closer to me, when I can normally hear helicopters, I realized I still could not hear it. It seemed to be moving toward my general location with a moderate speed unlike more rapid helicopters or small private planes. There seemed to be no urgency about it. That was very unusual. Other aircraft seem to have a specific purpose to their flight. This one did not give me that impression. I believe I noticed that it was not lit with running lights in the front. I noticed lights on the sides and the rear. As it got closer, I could see that it was much larger than a helicopter, that it had a wingspan and that it was essentially invisible due to having no color. It began to look like a blacked out and very large plane. It appeared to be much higher than helicopters and small planes and I noticed that there were no other aircraft in the sky above me or to the south and east. There was no other helicopter noise behind me. The sky was essentially silent and free of aircraft except this one. As it got well into this corner of Valley, it seemed to bear slightly to the west, following the 134 freeway, running along the north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains. Because of the altitude, it was difficult for me to determine whether it was actually over or north of the Santa Monica Mountains, but I decided it was actually over the Valley and close to being more closely above me. About this time, several minutes into following its steady and still silent flight path, I was able to identify the triangular shape of the aircraft. This was difficult at first because it was black against a dark sky. It almost was like a hole in the sky, but the rear lights and wingtip lights gave it some dimension. They were not bright lights, they were subdued, which caught my attention. I do not recall the colors. I believe they were white and red, but I'm not positive about that. As the now apparent shape of the plane was closer, I could see it was high, not nearly at passenger jet levels of 30,000 or 35,000 feet, but much higher than helicopters. I could also see that the angle of the nose was close to a 90 degree, nearly a right angle, shape, not swept back sharply like many modern planes. The wing angles were difficult to be sure of, but appeared to be perhaps 45 degree angles. I could see no rear wing edge cut outs, the rear edge of the triangle appeared to be straight across to the other tip. By now the size of the plane was becoming imposing. I would say intimidating. It was unlike the Stealth Bomber. Much larger, multiples of any single similar plane. The plane was still essentially silent, although I believe I heard a very low soft hum, unlike any motor or jet engine. I had never seen anything of this size in the sky before. It was very, very large, still moving at moderate speed. This surprised me and I started thinking that it was trying to avoid detection of its sound or speed, and how odd it was to try to fly across the SFV of all places, undetected. It seemed ridiculous. I started wondering whether the President was visiting Los Angeles and recalled him having been in San Diego very recently, and wondered if this was some new method to safely transport the President, and then realized that there was no way that this plane was designed to transport the President. I wondered briefly whether the plane was doing aerial photogrammetry because its flight was so steady, unswerving, almost relaxed. That also seemed ridiculous. I was quickly trying to figure out a logical reason for a massive plane like this to be flying over Los Angeles. As the plane passed my location, I continued following it and while it was generally still overhead, and somewhat south and west of my location, I was very surprised to see the single aircraft separate into 3 distinct identical, but smaller triangular aircraft. One continued on a direct course to the West, toward the far west end of the SFV, one seemed to ascend slightly and swung south in an arc with the wings tilted, up on the far side and of course, down on the tip closest to me, and it eventually disappeared from view over the Santa Monica Mountains. I could not tell whether it was above or beyond the 405 freeway to my west. The remaining section of the original craft looped more tightly toward the north and then swung east, reversing the original course, and flew back in generally the same flight path it had taken when entering the Valley. It got out of sight toward the east. I did not see it swing south toward Los Angeles or East Los Angeles. When the separation occurred, of course it was a stunning event and I wondered whether I had earlier actually been seeing from my low angle, three planes stacked in formation, appearing to be one, though separated and flying in close formation. I seriously considered that and determined that was impossible since I was now almost under the aircraft and had seen no separation in the aircraft as it approached me. I saw one aircraft and it separated in flight with no change in speed or direction into 3 component parts, all identical in shape, though smaller in size of course to make up the whole. I was unable at any time to see any vertical dimension to the aircraft. The blackness and limited warning lighting made me conclude these were U.S. military aircraft on a test flight. Obviously they were not alien craft; they had conventional though muted lighting just as we routinely use. I knew they were not foreign aircraft, flying discretely over Los Angeles. They were designed to be unseen, unheard, flying in a manner planned to not attract attention by ripping through the Los Angeles SFV at high speed, right over a major freeway that merges into the 101 freeway, both of which have massive traffic loads in both directions, not to mention all the residential and commercial areas with people outdoors walking their dogs if nothing else. The very low frequency close to the 20 Hz limits of generally relied upon standards for human hearing, which I believe I heard was distinct from freeway surface noise, was much less prominent and much lower frequency than the electrical hum from hi-tension power lines. I thought it must be a nuclear powered craft. I speculated as the 3 craft disappeared in the distance, the airspace still empty of any other aircraft that I could detect, that the separation procedure was an interesting tactical design to confuse enemy aircraft or land based observation. One plane or one missile, seeking to engage this plane suddenly would have to decide which of the three was to be selected as the new target. However, the size of the craft was so immense that it would be impossible to not see during daylight or limited light. During this approximately 10 minutes, no one else passed me on the residential street where I was walking. I saw no one else on the .75 mile street in front of me or the .1 mile behind me. No one has mentioned it to me since then, although I walk that street with my horse between 3 to 6 times per week and routinely converse with other walkers. I mentioned this event to my wife, and then forgot about it until I noticed an article which addressed it, in part, but which I learned just this evening by finally reading it, that a similar event was reported back in March or so of this year.","Attorney",1,3,"triangle",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2022,2020,4,11,21,"Evening","West",0,1,0,1,0

I been wanting to tell about this sighting for many years. Around 1980 my Mom,Dad and brother were traveling to Texas for my dad to attend a class for work. He was driving and my mom was in the front seat. My brother was laying on the back seat he?s 4 years older than me. I was laying on the back dash looking up at the stars. Watched Star Trek back then but not a fan and didn?t know anything about sightings or things like that. While i was gazing up i seen a light like a flashlight really far away, while this was going on my dads fuzz buster was going off it kinda surprised me but before i could even finish thinking it was in my face and i froze. Next i find myself on the back seat laying down and my brother on the back dash first thought was he?s to big to be up there then i hear my mom screaming i sat up looked forward and saw the ship in front of us it was only maybe a few feet off the ground and the size of a greyhound bus orange yellow glow off the back no noise it went forward toward a blinking caution light about a 1/4 mile ahead i guess moving about 20 mph not sure it turned straight up looked kinda like a missile it went up about a few 100 feet really slow and shot to the moon in the blink of a eye. My dad was very key on time and kept saying it was 10pm not 12pm but my mom just kept screaming , I turned to my brother as he slid down and set besides me i ask him what that was and he says shut up. My mom said if we tell anyone she would deny it and call us crazy, lol. My dad passed but he always said if ever had Alzheimer?s he would never forget that. I don?t know for sure but my mom wound up in the drivers seat after but its been along time ago but for sure my brother and i were switched I clearly remember that cause he couldn?t fit on the back dash.

I was in a Lyft on the way from Agoura Hills up to the Santa Barbara airport. It was the middle of the night and very dark. The driver and I were having good conversation, when suddenly she just pointed to the sky and we both went silent. We couldn?t make sense of what we were seeing. The sky was filled with a horizontal, orange glow. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a very, very brightly lighted object appeared and rose into the sky, disappearing into the night. It almost looked as though it had fire trailing after it, but not a long trail. It all happened very fast, as it seemed to disappear into the dark clouds. After that, both the driver and I kept searching the sky, wondering if we would see it again. We had no idea what it was, and the remainder of the ride was fully comprised of discussion about it. After the first sighting, we did see it again about two minutes later, but we did not see an object. We only saw that same orange hue in the sky. A horizontal glow. The Lyft driver thought she saw it a third time a few minutes later, just for a second, but I didn?t see that one. We kept talking about it, trying to make sense of it. We thought perhaps it was a missile or rocket or something, but that didn?t make sense, and it didn?t align with what we had seen. It was the orange horizontal glow across the sky that was very distinct and strange. We had no idea what it was, but by the end of the ride, we both agreed that it must have been a UFO. Neither of us had any ever seen anything like it in our entire lives.
(I only finally thought to make a video by the time the Lyft driver thought she saw it a third time, but even though I wasn?t able to catch it, I figure I?ll upload it anyway. I also have a recording of us when we saw the first two.)","Disabled (former professional trumpet player)",2,1,"unknown",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2022,2020,4,12,3,"Night","West",0,1,0,0,0

At approximately 2:10AM CST +/- 5 minutes, 3 of us individuals were standing outside a venue at 3520 Greenville Ave, Dallas, TX were making casual conversation as we all have mutual friends and acquaintances, just finished watching a live music event (ended 30 minutes prior), one of us was the event manager, another was friends with the manager of the band, and I, friends with the singer of the band. The technical details behind the sighting:

0 degrees being the horizon, and directly above us being 90 degrees, a ball orb about 1.5 miles up, we all caught the orb in each of the corner of our eyes when the object was about 85 degrees above us from true north traveling from east to west, moving directly in the direction towards Dallas Love Field Airport. We looked up by the time the object was 70 degrees above the horizon, and saw the object continue moving until it reached approximately 50 degrees above the horizon, maintaining the same trajectory, before we lost visual sight of the orb as it literally vanished, it was there one millisecond, the next millisecond it was gone. From the point of where the object was 85 degrees above us relative to our positioning. Witness 1 female was facing true north, witness 2 male, was facing true north, myself (witness 3 male) was facing directly west. From the point at which we all generally caught the object in the corner of our eyes to the point at which we all turned our heads, eyes locked onto the object,

The first witness, female, immediately said ""Oh my god, did we just see a shooting star?!""
The second witness, male, the event manager, said ""That was an orb! Guys, was that a UAP?!""
Me, third witness, male, said ""Shooting stars that low in our atmosphere would have had a trail of some sort""

My personal supporting background information pertaining to the following data afterwords: I was 1 page away from becoming an eagle scout in 2011, which is recognized by the military as a monumental achievement, I provided UHF LOS and SATCOM, HF BLOS (beyond line of sight), VHF LOS, SHF SATCOM, and EHF SATCOM communications for the CG-60 USS Normandy for 4 years as we fulfilled the role of ""Air Defense Commander"" (2015 USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group 12, I was part of the TR strike group work up group sail in August 2014, group sail deployment in January/February 2015, to the full March-December 2015 deployment), where I provided direct communications support for FA-18's for missions in the middle east. I am familiar with FA-18 and F-16 sound, viewing angle adjacent to relative distance, body shape at specific distances, and appearance at night. I lived at CID unit Corry Station where I watched NAS Pensacola ""Blue Angels"" practice almost every day for 8 months, and I lived directly behind Naval Station Norfolk's airfield on Granby Street where I watched various military aircraft fly over me for an entire year when I was not on the ship. I have only seen objects travel at that speed or greater when witnessing UAP in the Santa Rosa, CA area, when UAP are doing the same action, shooting across the sky in the atmosphere, no military aircraft or asset i.e. tomahawk missile has been witnessed by me that can travel at speeds even close to this orbs speed. At this time, I am a full time employee of a software company doing IT related work as well as full time student registered at Lone Star College System pursuing a B.S. in Physics.

Math and science facts about the observation:
- The color of the visible light that radiated from the orb was an off white, and was an almost identical color compared to the most common and standard off-white, Christmas tree light toned color.
- The orb was objectively a perfect sphere to all 3 of us.
- The visible light radiating from the orb did not diffract or reflect around gas at any point within the atmosphere while in our sight, NOT creating any sort of artifact (such as lunar halos etc) NOR did the light diffract or reflect against clouds at any point within the atmosphere.
- Referencing time, from the point at which the object was first seen in the corner of my eye when the object was above me 85 degrees above the horizon, to the point at which it disappeared from my viewing 50 degrees above the horizon when it disappeared, the duration was about ~1.8 seconds (would have disappeared at ""mississi"" when counting ""One Mississippi, Two Mississippi"" etc.
- NO sonic boom
- The object was traveling faster than a Block II/III/V tomahawk missile by several orders of magnitude, no manned aircraft could have traveled at that speed, the speed equivalency is an FA18 conducting a fly at a distance of 200 feet from the viewer.
- There was NO haze or aura or effect left in the atmosphere from the object, there was no trail left by the object, there were no FAA regulated lights (or any other lights)
- The object SHOULD have been detected by FAA radar from the Dallas Love Air Field as it practically flew literally over the airfield, the point at which the UAP disappeared at the blink of an eye would have been as it approached the airspace that is directly above the air field.

A satellite like object came across the sky from west horizon heading across the sky towards the east, at about 45? above the west horizon it start to gently veer towards the south and changed direction so it was moving from north to south. Its closest point of approach was at the beginning of its southern track. It was viewed with binoculars and it was very similar in colour and form to an Iridium satellite, however unlike the Iridium it only had 2 light spikes. Also unlike the Iridium orangey colour, this orange was a bit more gold/yellow. It was also much larger than an Iridium and the ISS for that matter. When it changed track from W to E to N to S, it passed slightly below Jupiter and on the beginning of its southern track its magnitude was greater than Jupiter's for a time (> ?2.7). There is no way to be certain but the light spikes suggest that it was bullet or triangular in shape.

In terms of speed, it was similar to a satellite, however it did appear to stutter at one point as if it hit a couple of speed arresters very briefly. On the beginning of its southern track it also did 2 very slightly accelerations and decelerations back to is normal speed, not major velocity changes but it was visible.

It continued along to southern track and then at about 45? above the southern horizon the light seemed to shut off for a fraction of a second and it was gone. It then reappeared in and? it literally accelerated from 0 to faster than the speed of light in the direction of east to west and vanished in a fraction of a second. Even though the event was so brief, it was incredible in so far as you could actually perceive the acceleration and that perception was aided by the fact that the point of light became a thick LINE of BRIGHT orange light which was continuous from 0 to gone. Although the beginning of the line was thick and it became progressively much thinner as the acceleration increased so that by the time it vanished it was a very thin line. Visually it may have seemed like 3 or 4 distinct widths and intensities. The thick starting line of light was still present when the thin vanishing line vanished. The streak of light existed for the entire fraction of a second, all 3 or 4 steps of it. To put the size of the line in perspective, in the sky, it was about the length of your index finger.","IT Operations",2,1,"unknown",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,2023,2020,1,2,19,"Evening",NA,0,1,0,0,0

At approximately 8:40 PM, I exited my house to retrieve my iPhone, which I'd accidentally left in my car during a previous evening excursion. I looked back to the west as I walked to my car to see if Jupiter and Saturn had already set?they apparently had?and the first object appeared through the bare branches of my next-door neighbor's tree.

The object appeared at least five times as large as Saturn or Jupiter and was brilliantly illuminated, almost as if on fire. The light was in the yellow-orange range of the spectrum. At first, I thought it might be a missile, but the illumination was in a circular pattern with no exhaust trail. The illumination was also more sparkly than a missile trail. The illumination was the wrong color to be aircraft landing lights and again was circular without the forward beam of aircraft landing lights.

The object moved across the sky from west to east, just south of the ecliptic. As it came over the city of Columbus, the illumination completely dimmed and the actual disc-shaped object itself could be detected. I followed the object until it was no longer visible in the east.

Then, as I turned back toward the west to go back into my house, an identical object was crossing the sky in the same manner?just south of the ecliptic, moving west to east. Its illumination also dimmed as it moved across the city, and its disc-like shape could also be detected.

Again, I followed it across the sky toward the east and again turned back to the west to see yet another identical object, again just south of the ecliptic, moving west to east.

At this point, I ran into the house and summoned my thirty-eight-year-old son to join me outside to view the objects. As he came out into our driveway, we both looked back toward the western horizon to see the fourth object as it exactly repeated the behavior of the first three objects I'd seen.

Some of the objects remained illuminated longer than others, and one object, after its illumination had diminished, appeared larger. This apparently larger object appeared to either be rotating or to have a red light circling around it.

Altogether, I watched eight of these apparently evenly-spaced objects cross the sky from west to east. My son saw the final five of the objects.

Their speed is difficult to estimate because I could not discern the altitude. My guess is that the objects were considerably lower than a transcontinental passenger jet, perhaps only ten thousand feet altitude, yet they were completely silent.

The eighth and final object crossed the sky at approximately 8:50 PM.

I am attaching images captured with my iPhone. However, these images are somewhat blurry because my phone automatically adjusted exposure times to compensate for the low light levels. I was able to upload less than half of the images I captured, and not necessarily the best images.

Massive orb appeared that very rapidly grew in size and brightness to a huge scale, then shot into a near-imperceivable distance, almost like a warp-speed bullet/fireball going into outer space. The trail dissipated almost immediately. This entire event took about 4 seconds. After looking into the starry sky for about a minute, my eyes caught 3 'stars' moving, and I looked at it for about 30 seconds. They were adjacent (1 craft) ? seemingly a triangular one. It was 'bending' the light behind it (cloaking) and I know this because I saw the stars 'warping' in the sky behind it (in the background). It was hovering and moving very slowly. I took my eyes off of it for a few seconds, and when I looked back, could not relocate the craft anymore. There was a helicopter or human-aircraft/light flying in the exact direction and vicinity of where these events occurred. I was staring at the sky for so long that, another guest/snowboarder asked me if I'm okay, and I told him what I saw. I could see in his eyes that he was spooked, but he believed me.
After some thought, I speculate that whatever the first orb was, was connected to the triangle. The triangle may have been 'ported.' I have no further explanation and as a ufo enthusiast since I was a kid, this is the first-ever encounter I have ever experienced. I'm thrilled but spooked at the same time.
I did not sense anything ominous about the craft, other than a totally normal defensive mental state, when I decided to look away out of self-created fear. In fact, the entire thing was beautiful.

On the evening of 4/12/23, I was shooting stock night footage of Seattle for my drone company. I had not looked over all the full resolution videos on my PC until last night, 4/16.

Upon watching one of the videos, I saw what looked like a rocket powered aircraft or missile in the sky above Seattle. I played the video back multiple times and could not rule it as lens flare since the light source in the video had a definitive tail that did not change direction as the camera panned the cityscape.

Atlanta-Hartsfield (ATL) Sighting Report
Narrative of Events During Takeoff

2215 Hours: After a 15 minute gate hold, the aircraft, a Boeing 767-300ER with 226 souls and 2 laps on board, is pushed back from the terminal. Ground Control clears the aircraft to the active taxiway.

2245 Hours: Idle fourth in line, after 30 minutes aircraft cleared to taxi onto RWY 26 Left where we are instructed to hold. ATL Tower reports clear skies, visibility 10 miles or better, altimeter 29.92, winds calm.

2248 Hours: Cleared for takeoff, ATL Tower instructs us to climb heading 275 degrees to intercept course 288 degrees to Snufy. Flight course put us just west of East Point and south of state route 166, where we expect to be cleared to 15,000 feet, and from there to flight level 240 (24,000 feet).

2252 Hours: Outbound from ATL, Departure clears us to flight level 240. First Quarter Moon visible in the clear night sky, having risen high on the eastern horizon at sunset.

2300 Hours: Climbing through 15,000 feet, First Officer points over the instrument panel towards a sizable burst of white light, 12 o?clock off the aircraft nose, approximately 5 miles distant.

2301 Hours: My initial impression is that the burst represents some kind of missile denotation, and, as a result, I throttle the engines back so as not to ingest possible debris from the blast.

2302 Hours: First Officer reports the sighting to ATL Departure and requests a vector change further to the west. A mild buffet to the aircraft, accompanied by an audible drop in engine RPM. Cabin lights flicker for a moment or two, although the annunciator panel remains illuminated.

2303 Hours: Departure vectors us further west, which puts us outside the burst radius, and reports commercial traffic descending inbound as we resume our climb to flight level 240. Traffic, an Airbus heading for ATL, comes up on VHF Guard Frequency.

2310 Hours: After speculation by both flight crews as to the origin of the burst, resembling a nebulous ball of light, First Officer and myself concurred over the VHF frequency that the object appeared stationary, of significant size, perhaps 700 feet in diameter, and remained to the east, having fallen behind our present position as we continued to climb. It was, as I pointed out, ?still out there,"" and appeared as bright as the moon, ?...sort of a fuzzy silver ball.?

2315 Hours: Having been cleared to flight level 360, our cruising altitude, we continued to vector toward the northwest, en route to Chicago. It should be noted that ATL Departure showed no additional traffic, other than the inbound Airbus, and the remainder of the flight passed without incident

Quiet afternoon no signs of planes it's, 10 am, in the parking lot of the storage unit across from Miejers. Myself, my wife and 2 Co workers were helping move my camper! Suddenly ear shattering afterburner on 2 what I think were F-16 or F-22 were flying together whilst dogfighting something I couldn't see at first. They would circle fast as they could looking intently for something. Circling the sun around about 2 or 3 times and suddenly there was this white/metallic disc hard to see because it was shining with the sun, it seemed to hide in the sun from the fighters, whom obviously couldn't see it. The UAP was extremely fast it was capable of overtaking and outmanuvering the fighter jets with extreme ease. It would overtake a jet, stop suddenly and seemed to turn toward the incoming jet like spin in there direction without moving. The jet would shoot out anti missile flares like it was under direct attack. The UAP was also comfortable to just spin again and make the next jet flanking shoot its anti missile flares! There was clear distress. The fighters took off together repeating this attack approximately 3 times before taking off in an earshattering retreat. The UAP sat in the sun a moment longer and seemed to circle the area almost as in a victory lap, it then departed with absolutely no sound in the complete opposite direction as the fighter jets had flown. To be clear when the UAP was stationary and the jets had flown away everytime the 3 attempts and the retreat the only clear sound of a airplane was the fighters who seemed to be intercepting this sudden threat. I did not see if the UAP had shot anything I could define as a weapon.

I was sitting on my back porch when the light from the diatant cell tower caught my eye and made me look up. I saw Jupiter and then when I went to look around just in a normal fashion, enjoying the fact that it cooled down, this anomoly caught my eye because it was a light that looked like it was in fog, but there is currently not a cloud in the sky, which I documented by video also. I quickly took a photograph and reviewed it, blowing it up, and could clearly see that it was not a helicopter nor airplane as there was no shape to it, no blinking lights,and soundless. I immediately began to video it and happened to catch an aircraft flying the opposite direction, which allowed a comparison with the anomoly, along with the moon and a star that are also present in the same frame. As I continued to video the anomoly suddenly got bright and what I can only describe is that it looked like it poofed something out of the front of it, similar to like watching a slow motion video of the sound barrier being broken or a bullet exiting a firearm. I continued to video it and the light from the barn created a glare in the camera, so I continued to watch it with the naked eye. It was like it suddenly disappeared into thin air. I literally cannot rationalize what I saw. I grew up around airplanes, helicopters, NASA, etc., as a child, coming from a family of aviators and air traffic controllers, and I legitimately cannot find an explanation to what I just witnessed.

I can best give the time as: past sunset, still a little orange at the horizon. Venus was in the orange part of sky near horizon. The moon was crescent and it was illuminating some high clouds that night. The UFO started as a glowing orb moving across the western sky from N-NW towards S-SE. I can't tell if the glow was caused by interaction with high clouds, but I initially thought it was a satellite reentry judging by the speed and apparent distance. There were no blinking lights or sound, and it was moving about same speed as a passing satellite.

As the object passed (from my viewpoint) under the crescent moon, that's when a donut shaped cloud formed just ahead of the object and, surprisingly to me, the cloud seemed to progress ahead of the object faster than the object was moving. The cloud appeared to move in the same direction as the object as the cloud expanded, similar to someone blowing a smoke ring from a cigar. From my viewpoint, I was seeing the cloud almost edge-on, but off enough to see clearly that it was a ring-shaped cloud.

My two best guesses for what I saw are: A - a satellite bouncing off the upper atmosphere, and some part of it triggered a transonic induced ring cloud. B - a craft launched a projectile that created the ring cloud as the projectile went transonic.

I never heard any kind of sonic boom though, nor could I ever see any projectile (just the cloud formed ahead of the object that I could see). The ring cloud is what made me think this was weird enough to report.

I have photos and the exact date I just haven?t looked through my phone to get them. For so long I thought I was crazy. I was the first to see it. It was in the middle of a prayer. I couldn?t help but to gasp for air hit my friend who is closest to me on the shoulder and point to him so I wasn?t totally disruptive or disrespectful. He said something like what the ((one word deleted)) that ((malle name deleted)), who just lost his daughter locked up the whole prayer stopped the children see it and so does his fiance. So more than 3, 4 that are adults. The rest were 16 years of age and younger is my guess.

We had no idea what this was at the time. None of it had really come out besides maybe one photo on main stream news. What was totally awkward in my opinion is that I even looked behind me in that direction while we were praying for my friends are dead daughter. I don?t know what got my attention. This object did not move, it was so metallic you could see the clouds through the reflection. What I do know is whatever I seen customs and border protection Hass to have it on film as well as they have cameras that point right and that direction that overlooks the whole border. This object disappeared. I don?t know how and I don?t know why. I also found it odd that it was not being displaced by wind. I would take a lie detector test I would be cross, examined along with the others just to prove to myself I?m not crazy. This is something I am very hesitant on even reporting that?s why I?ve waited this long. I don?t want any media attention. I don?t want my name in any file. I can look at prior photos from that day and put it between a two hour window plus or minus when we seen this floating projectile. I have photos of Mike, and myself stranded on the side of I 69 that was on our way back from the funeral home. This was when we met at the park to say a prayer and do a celebration of life for Seth?s daughter. Another reason why I did not want to bring it to anyone?s attention is because how disrespectful I am for bringing this up on such a tragic day for him. I was also pursuing a job with homeland security at the time, and did not want to put that attention on myself. I don?t know what to do but do you have this information now I?ve done my part. If I start getting contacted by the news or anyone without talking to what I?m guessing, would be a federal agent who overseas this type of stuff I will not admit anything. I?m being very serious about this I will dump my phone and not speak to anyone unless it?s documented with my family shielded from ANY and ALL types of attention. None of us asked for this that day. This is some thing we would be taking to our graves because it has impacted my friends so much due to the loss of his daughter. I do not want to be a constant reminder for him. I was diagnosed with a terminal brain disease and their mental health honestly isn?t the best. All three of us are veterans, but there was more than just us out there that day that seen this.

I was at an event at White Sands National Monument with roughly 100 people. It was a clear night with few clouds  and a bright half moon. At approximately 9 pm we saw a slow moving aircraft with bright lights surrounded in a hazy cloud. It was roughly at the same altitude as a helicopter, but it was not a helicopter. It was traveling SE to NW.

As it passed by us, it was hard to see the shape because it was so bright and hazy but it appeared to be a sphere. No wings and no sound. We continued watching as it passed by and noticed a more dense cloud beginning to envelope it. Then the light disappeared and the cloud hung around for about 30 more seconds before dissolving. The craft was abruptly gone.

I guesstimate we watched it for maybe 4- 5 minutes and figure during that time, it covered about 30-40 miles. It did not reach to horizon line when it disappeared.

I was in my back yard watering plants when I heard a large jet to my south banking toward the east. Living near the DFW airport and other smaller airports I look up quite often to identify aircraft. The aircraft I was looking at was a large USAF or Civilian aircraft cargo type gray in color. I was trying to see the markings when I noticed another very large cigar shape craft to my right traveling @ a high rate of speed with a climbing attitude. This cigar shaped craft did not appear to have wings or any to stabilize its flight. It was coming from the northwest gaining altitude as it traversed. Living very close to DFW airport this did not appear to be any aircraft I had witnessed in the past. Also, as former military I was trained to identify several aircraft as an Antiaircraft missile team chief. The altitude I would estimate @ first sight was 8,000 to 10,000 feet and as I watched it gain altitude till vanished it traveled several miles. Weather conditions were clear sky, no clouds. The object made no sound as I observed it. I have no pictures and rely only on my profession training to observe and identify aircraft.","Retired US Army and Transportation Security Officer @ DFW Airport",1,1,"cigar",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,"Unexplained","Possible",0,0,0,0,2023,2020,3,9,8,"Morning","South",0,1,0,0,0

An object travels in a straight line at a very high speed, not like an animal flying. I can only relate my impression to a bullet but I didn?t hear anyone shooting. The object came out of the woods of my backyard and traveled straight towards the front yard passing between the house and the shed at a height of 6-8 ft. I took the image on my iPhone from my tv screen and recorded it in real time and slow play. The object appears to be opaque and leaves a trace image of its trail. I?m guessing it traveled 50 feet in one second? I don?t know why the camera triggered and then happened to catch the image. The next camera in the direction it headed was not triggered to record but did capture the image of that area about 10 seconds before the moment that was recorded. The night before there was a light in the area that the object came from.","Retired law enforcement",0,1,"cylinder",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,"Bird","Possible",0,0,0,0,2023,2020,3,9,23,"Night","South",0,1,0,0,0
